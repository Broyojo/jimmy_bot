Jimmy#8080: **Miscellaneous Mondays #1: Immortality** <[newline]> *Originally posted 2019-10-07* <[newline]> You are given the choice between two different kinds of immortality: <[newline]> *Physical Immortality* - your body is indestructible. Nothing external can hurt or kill you. You are just fine in the vacuum of space or at the bottom of an ocean, and bullets bounce off your skin. However, you will still age, and you will die at the end of a normal human lifespan. <[newline]> *Biological Immortality* - you do not physically age. You can feel, physically, exactly the same at 200 years old as you do now. However, you remain vulnerable to external threats and can be killed by them, just not by aging. <[newline]> - Which option do you choose? <[newline]> - Why do you choose that option? <[newline]> - How do you now live your life differently? <[newline]> Discuss in <#416276124977332226> . <[newline]> --- <[newline]> Link to start of discussion: https://discordapp.com/channels/401255675264761866/416276124977332226/630842900971782164 <[newline]> --- <[newline]> Additional details: <[newline]> *Physical Immortality* <[newline]> - You DO still need to sleep. <[newline]> - You DO NOT still need to eat. <[newline]> - You DO still require exercise to be physically fit. <[newline]> - You DO NOT feel physical pain. <[newline]> - You DO NOT get physical illnesses. <[newline]> - Your hair and nails cannot be cut, but you gain control over their growth. At any given time you can choose to grow them outwards at the normal rate, grow them inwards at the same rate, or to keep them at their current length. <[newline]> *Biological Immortality* <[newline]> - You gain control over your aging. At any given time you can choose to be aging forwards at one year per year, aging backwards at one year per year, or not be aging at all.
Jimmy#8080: **Philosophy Phridays #1: Simulation Hypothesis** <[newline]> *Originally posted 2019-10-04* <[newline]> Using known physics, it is possible to simulate a human mind if you have a powerful enough supercomputer. It is furthermore possible to simulate billions of minds, and to simulate the world around those minds so that they can be fed appropriate physical stimulus. <[newline]> Consider: <[newline]> - How likely is it that this reality is a simulation? <[newline]> - If this reality *is* a simulation, how would that change your outlook on reality? <[newline]> - When humankind becomes a civilization capable of running simulations as complex as this one, should we do it? Would you personally run a simulation on your home computer? <[newline]> Discuss in <#416276124977332226>. <[newline]> --- <[newline]> Link to start of discussion: https://discordapp.com/channels/401255675264761866/416276124977332226/629755364082057226
