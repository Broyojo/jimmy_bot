xxzapoidzxx#9442: I found a minor bug where if I change the text on a label and hit ctrl+z the game crashes but no data is lost.
Ecconia#4929: Mildly frustrating, that it is apparently relevant which face of a parent board is pointing down. <[newline]> At this point, I would even assume it is a bug. I know that this topic is technically tricky, but there are ways to handle this.
DrewFitz#1526: Oh hey, installing through the itchio app instead of downloading it from the website made it all work
Ecconia#4929: Personally I think of this channel as a place to discuss bugs and seek help, while the website is a place to formally file a bug (or feature request) - scheduled to be fixed eventually. <[newline]> But that is just my opinion, I think nobody really wants to go over this channel to find bugs.
circuitgamer77#0377: I haven't reported many bugs on the website.
circuitgamer77#0377: There's a bug tracker on the website, but I don't really understand the relation between tracking bugs here and there.
DrewFitz#1526: Am I just SOL on all of this? Or is there a more formal place to file bugs?
BitorBit#6268: ez alt+f4
Ecconia#4929: Wow this is new, an invisible board with invisible child components, crazy! <[newline]> Outlining and interaction works perfectly fine. <[newline]> (No clue how this bug happened, was not able to open console, and the game just crashed)
Ecconia#4929: I just added ALL the mods, and reproduced the issue. <[newline]> Here the stacktrace - time to understand it to write a ticket which elaborates why it happens. <[newline]> (And yes, I have a mod to print stacktraces to logs and console - ya gotta have the mods for the mods) <[newline]> Ticket: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/346>
Ecconia#4929: If the client has components which the server does not have, UNDO can kick the player with "Component types map mismatch!" error. :/ <[newline]> Which is funny, because it only happens on UNDO and not in any other situation. Like the server even transmits the relevant components...
circuitgamer77#0377: It's dependent on angle - the lower I look before pausing the more of the hotbar vanishes.
circuitgamer77#0377: This is a super minor one - half of my hotbar vanishes when I'm in the pause menu.  May be other menus too - I haven't tested others yet.
circuitgamer77#0377: Nice :)  I'm working on a 32 bit fast CPU, but it's missing some functionality, like interrupts.   <[newline]>  <[newline]> (by the way, if you don't want to be in this conversation for whatever reason tell me - I won't be able to tell from your messages.  Just want to say that before I forget)
elblorenz32#4966: both, I'm having a semi functional computer built in this world (16 bit data, 16 bit addr)
circuitgamer77#0377: Were you just testing the limit, or were you making RAM or something like that?
elblorenz32#4966: well... i guess it went from 0.5 or 1 to ~4.3MB 😄
circuitgamer77#0377: I usually have 3-7 MB saves, as a reference point.
elblorenz32#4966: lol <[newline]>  <[newline]> ok... I can't even pick it up... it became too big
circuitgamer77#0377: if you have smaller saves you won't see it as much.
circuitgamer77#0377: The game crashes on load if the render distance is high enough and there's enough stuff in the world.
circuitgamer77#0377: Ok, so very differently balanced than mine.  I have waaay more RAM than my CPU can handle - my CPU is the weak point by far.  64GB RAM, RTX 3060 GPU, but only a Ryzen 5.
elblorenz32#4966: i never managed to crash it when load ing
circuitgamer77#0377: I've had LW crash on world load, but not many other cases.
elblorenz32#4966: it is an older one but with 16G ram, an i7 and a GTX1080(i think?)
circuitgamer77#0377: I have a pretty good PC, so that may explain the crash vs freeze.
circuitgamer77#0377: What's your PC specs?  This is just me being curious - I don't have any answers for the crash.
elblorenz32#4966: maybe I hit some memory limit and WindOS was like 'nah, not gonna do this' <[newline]>  <[newline]> yeah, i hope too
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm hoping that 0.91 has some copy performance increases, not just load times and bug fixes - it definitely needs to be improved for large structures.
circuitgamer77#0377: Ok, different than my experience then :)
elblorenz32#4966: nope, it crashed to dektop
circuitgamer77#0377: It doesn't actually crash - it just freezes for a long time while it figures out the copy behind the scenes
circuitgamer77#0377: Not all the time, but yes :)
elblorenz32#4966: Pro tip: do not attenpt to make unreasonibly large pillars of stacked circuit boards... it will crash when you try to copy it <[newline]> edit: I was at about 2^15 1x1 boards and tried to copy them...
Ecconia#4929: Uff it cannot load the ΩSubassembly DLL file, which should not be the case, funnily mostly the ones that pirate the game have this issue. <[newline]> But didn't know that its a problem on Mac too. There are some people that got the Mac version running - via Steam mostly I fear.
DrewFitz#1526: 
DrewFitz#1526: The Unity logs show some issues loading a subassembly:
DrewFitz#1526: 2022-04-03T17:43:53Z | INFO  | [Lidgren network client] Initialized network client on port 55127 using protocol IPv4 <[newline]> 2022-04-03T17:43:53Z | INFO  | [Online manager] Setting status to Online -  <[newline]> 2022-04-03T17:44:45Z | INFO  | [Lidgren network client] Disconnecting from server: quitting game <[newline]> 2022-04-03T17:44:45Z | INFO  | [Online manager] Setting status to Offline -
DrewFitz#1526: Nothing helpful in the logs:
DrewFitz#1526: After all that though, the game gets stuck at "the game is loading lol" after the initial welcome screen.
DrewFitz#1526: Found a workaround, the .app file must be moved from the folder directly into the Applications folder (either the root or user-level one) along with the Game Data and Server folders. This is a bit cumbersome since the game creates more folders (such as the logs folder) directly in your Applications directory, which really shouldn't be written to. It's better to use `~/Library/Application Support/<app identifier>` as discussed here: https://forum.unity.com/threads/solved-special-folder-path-in-mac.23686/
DrewFitz#1526: Could be related to this: https://forum.unity.com/threads/app-translocation-security-fails.1032727/
DrewFitz#1526: I unzipped the file from itchio and put the resulting folder in `/Applications`
GHXX#9078: did you by chance get logicworld delivered inside a zip (or something similar), and you are running it directly from that?
Ecconia#4929: From where are you running the game? Does it come with an installer, or is it just the LogicWorld folder or application?
Ecconia#4929: But it seems, that it cannot even get access to a temporary logs folder... Weird
Ecconia#4929: Oh that's the Unity logs. Not the LogicWorld logs. <[newline]> But: <[newline]> `Access to the path "/private/var/folders/s0/6fvwz5t95p1ccd6jrtnx0k_m0000gn/T/AppTranslocation/B42B654D-FFB9-4112-B7CF-466CA49B8EBF/d/logs" is denied.` <[newline]> And worse: `Could not find a part of the path '/private/var/folders/s0/6fvwz5t95p1ccd6jrtnx0k_m0000gn/T/AppTranslocation/B42B654D-FFB9-4112-B7CF-466CA49B8EBF/d/GameData'.` <[newline]> Already sound quite bad.
DrewFitz#1526: Found it, it was `~/Library/Logs/Logic World/`
Ecconia#4929: Had to think for a bit. From where are you starting the game? It should be in that folder, in the `logs` subfolder.
DrewFitz#1526: What directory should I look for a log file in?
Ecconia#4929: If you can't even get to the main menu, the client already has an issue. <[newline]> Could you send the latest log file here ? <@167682799120285696>
Ecconia#4929: Oh wait, you already did that. Then it is a bit more tricky.
Ecconia#4929: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/163> <[newline]> Jimmy sent a link in this issue, maybe that helps.
GCMwasco#8049: depending on how far you wanna take it. Could always run it on a virtual machine and avoid trying to get it to work in macOS directly  lol If you have a beefy-ish setup
DrewFitz#1526: Is there a trick to getting the itchio version of Logic World to run on macOS? It first said the app couldn't run, which I tracked down to one the main executable not having the executable permission flag set but once the app window opens it's just a black screen.
Ecconia#4929: Whip's: <https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/905378240338726942/949778870654079006> <[newline]> Mine: <https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/905378240338726942/938430551541579806> <[newline]> But I am basically waiting for the 0.91 update, before I would use my server again. Whips server is still small, so one can use it nicely. I also have another server, for my "display" project, but one needs a mod there, and building is not allowed. <[newline]> -> But that's the only two online servers right now, we used to have quite the amount two months or so ago.
ThaCuber#5611: which two?
Ecconia#4929: Huh? Which servers do you mean, the ones in <#905378240338726942> and on the website? <[newline]> Most are down indeed. Like 2 are still up to my knowledge. <[newline]> (But let me quickly add more servers to my server list to check - totally not gonna lag the server list even more).
ThaCuber#5611: none of the servers seem to work
elblorenz32#4966: I'd say only the last one (Error 1/3, the 1st message) happened after the error screen (based on console order)
Ecconia#4929: Ahh so the last two happened while opening the error screen already. Good that it managed opening it anyway. <[newline]> But the main error could be anything. (Actually that specific method has a bunch of places where it could encounter null, although its not big. It loops over arrays a bunch of times).

Ecconia#4929: No it is not
elblorenz32#4966: the stacktrace should be visible in the console shouldn't it?
Ecconia#4929: Which you then might send for example here.
Ecconia#4929: Open the console, and then click the error message, that copies the stacktrace.
elblorenz32#4966: 
elblorenz32#4966: got another issue... where do I find the actual error log? since the client and server log only show, I disconnected...  <[newline]>  <[newline]> ok, I might have to clarify: the game does not fully crash, it just shows me the following screen:
elblorenz32#4966: ok, gimme some time imma produce it soon
Ecconia#4929: If you know its a null pointer, there must be a stacktrace somewhere. <[newline]> So we could figure out where exactly it breaks.
elblorenz32#4966: I am the type that likes to keep programs open for a long time... <[newline]> But after a few hours LW just crashes to a NullPointer error, no matter what I did before... maybe some overflow occurs after some time?
Ecconia#4929: I just pulled the Alt+F4
Flampt#3906: I just delete any wire and undo
Ecconia#4929: Hmm tasty, didn't have this one in a while. <[newline]> Imagine LW cleaning up all states before joining a world after a crash-kick. <[newline]> (Got an index error while multi-select grabbing. Multiplayer. So the outlining must be stuck inside one layer).
BitorBit#6268: as i said before
gnog#2259: haha floating point go brrr...
Ecconia#4929: Hmm, scrolled all the way down. Yet I see that there must be more content.
binaryclock03#5762: I see
Jimmy#8080: For components that are half a square, they will be at the 15cm position, no rounding necessary. At one third of a square, it's 10cm.
Jimmy#8080: Each square is 30cm x 30cm
Erikbot#6368: it will round to some value that is close enough. because it uses fixed point, the rounding will always  be perfect and compounding errors are not possible
binaryclock03#5762: So how will that work? Because some components right now are half a square while some are 1/3.. there is no happy way to get that to line up is there? Unless each square was 12 mm...
Erikbot#6368: 1 "unit" will be 1 mm
binaryclock03#5762: Yeah that makes sense
Erikbot#6368: instead of floating point, it will use integers
binaryclock03#5762: Ah.. meaning?
binaryclock03#5762: I know eventually it would happen with quarters too
Erikbot#6368: LW is going to use a fixed point system.
binaryclock03#5762: Isn't this mostly because it's thirds? This wouldn't happen as quickly with quarters or something right?
Jimmy#8080: Fixes are coming
katkosmos#6502: gotta love floating point errors
katkosmos#6502: actually, looks like this has already been reported before lol
katkosmos#6502: components are placed off grid despite being shown as being on grid while being placed (after being placed, it moves to an off-grid position)
elblorenz32#4966: At least on a german system, the numpad toggle button gets called "Pause" when selected for a button <[newline]> It should rather say "Num" or have such a fancy arrow standing on a base and pointing up, or sth similar <[newline]> But "Pause" doesn't fit, cause there is another button (sometimes) for that name
Ecconia#4929: Hmm tasty, dragging a color from the color picker to trash - **lw crashes to desktop** <[newline]> I am literally always afraid of using the color box of the color picker - ALWAYS... <[newline]>  <[newline]> By the symptoms I would say that thing has serious index-out-of-bounds issues and infinite-loops. Cause the game freezes like hell. <[newline]> Nah still cannot use it...
circuitgamer77#0377: :)
Jimmy#8080: Fixed in 0.91 :)
circuitgamer77#0377: I actually thought that was fixed...  I guess it was just the number spam when cloning...
Broyojo#2667: yeah it is useful info
DADp#7461: game just letting you know its 0
Flampt#3906: bruh my whole console
Jimmy#8080: Working on it
SilentSoulsSr#1716: I am kinda addicted to the game, so i will be messing around anyway. but Yeah, until the next update i have no hope of getting this fixed.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yeah, that one's frustrating.  I have the same problem with a few of my multiplier designs.  I guess we just have to wait...
SilentSoulsSr#1716: I do not think collisions is in range of my problems. https://imgur.com/a/DxUHlPm
circuitgamer77#0377: Same for pretty much everyone for now - should be fixed in the next update, but for now there's a mod to disable collisions.
SilentSoulsSr#1716: this floating point error is breaking me, I cannot seem to get a little bit of hight, and align stuff so it will connect.
SilentSoulsSr#1716: Probably.
Broyojo#2667: oh no is this that old floating point bug?
Ecconia#4929: Yeah that is annoying. The next game update comes with a modification which ||might|| prevent this from happening.
SilentSoulsSr#1716: Things do not align properly, making a connection tower impossible. This misallignment gets worse the higher i go.
Ecconia#4929: Ohhh aparently these overlay-hints get rendered behind the console *uff*, so one does not see them while console is open. <[newline]> I smell hack - seems to be fine for normal windows.
Ecconia#4929: Lol I can even reproduce this. <[newline]> Just put your mouse over a console button and then close the console.
Ecconia#4929: Quick, there is a floating exception, capture it before its too late!
Dragon Lord#6944: ^^
Ecconia#4929: Very good and wise words, good summary. I like.
PseudoGoose#2841: Sorry if you already considered all of this, at the very least it was was a fun nerd-snipe for me to think about
PseudoGoose#2841: Now, I still think fixed point is a good idea, it can definitely help with precision issues for global positions that are far away from the world origin.
PseudoGoose#2841: > are inherently going to be imprecise when working with *any finite number system* <[newline]> I'm calling it now, fixed point isn't going to solve this. You can definitely mitigate it for right-angle rotations by directly constructing the correct rotation matrix out of -1.0, 0.0, and 1.0 values. Unfortunately other angles (e.g. fine rotation) are still going to introduce errors. (Although maybe you can also increase precision for those a little bit, by hard-coding their rotation matrices too)
Jimmy#8080: Correct, this is happening soon, for both positions and rotations
PseudoGoose#2841: Expanded theory: I think is is a loss of precision in the _rotation_ of the board. When you're placing boards face-to-face or mounts, it is the default orientation of the component so there is zero rotation each layer (quaternion `<0, 0, 0, 1>`) which is effectively infinitely precise when we're doing FP math, it won't change the coordinates at all. But stacking end-to-end will involve a rotation by 90 degrees, If using radian axis-angle, the angle is pi/2, or in quaternions it would be `<1/sqrt(2), 0, 0, 1/sqrt(2)>`. Both of which contain irrational values that are inherently going to be imprecise when working with any finite number system.
PseudoGoose#2841: I might be super behind in this discussion but last I heard Jimmy was considering switching to fixed-point
PseudoGoose#2841: From left to right: <[newline]> 1. A lot of short mounts <[newline]> 2. Boards placed end-to-end, at first one at a time (the bottom part that looks mostly straight), and then after that it's grabbing the whole stack and placing it on top of itself. <[newline]> 3. Boards placed end-to-end, cloning the whole stack each time. Much better but still a noticeable twist and it is shifted by a few tiles at the top compared to the bottom. <[newline]> 4. Boards placed face-to-face. <[newline]> 5. A lot of large mounts.
PseudoGoose#2841: That's my theory
PseudoGoose#2841: So there is something wrong specifically with the calculations that happen when you _place_ boards on their edge
PseudoGoose#2841: Also worth pointing out, if you clone the whole stack of end-to-end boards every time (so the size doubles every time you place), it takes a lot longer for those errors to show up (size-wise) compared to placing one board at a time
PseudoGoose#2841: I'm not convinced that the weird offsets of component children can just be chalked up to "floating point". I think really what's happening is that there is some small error in the transformation between local (relative to parent) and global positions that accumulates more and more as you nest deeper and deeper. <[newline]> And, as far as I can tell, it only happens when stacking boards "end-to-end". I haven't been able to reproduce it for boards stacked face-to-face or for mounts.
GHXX#9078: ayyy :D
Jimmy#8080: Working on the vanilla fix to this problem right now :)
zandy#3110: Oh, fantastic.
circuitgamer77#0377: There's also the LoadAccelerator mod, which is also a fix.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes, it does
zandy#3110: Oh, that absolutely worked. I turned the render distance back up to 600 after the load and everything seems to be working fine. Do you know if simulation still happens beyond render distance?
circuitgamer77#0377: It's the fix to a bug that I think is the same as the one you're experiencing, but I don't know for sure if it's the same thing.
circuitgamer77#0377: I would say try reducing the render distance to minimum before loading - I don't know if that's the problem, but it's one quick thing to try.
zandy#3110: I deleted the player file, which set me back at the spawnpoint. My player fell about half a meter, which was a good sign, but when I moved the mouse, the crash happened all the same.
lilKdoggie#0493: Yo anyone run into this midi bug yet? <[newline]> When I press my sustain pedal, it forces all currently press keys to be no longer pressed in game even though I am still pressing the key! <[newline]> (Yes I did test my Midi Piano in other programs to make sure it wasn't an error with the midi) <[newline]>  <[newline]> Here is a video to show the bug:
zandy#3110: I've got a world that suddenly won't load. Looked through the logs, I can't find any error logged in there other than I suddenly disconnect when the world starts. Basically, the world will load and I'll get a frozen first rendered frame then the whole program crashes:
Prime#8883: Ah, so you must edit the client also. I missed that. That might explain why I was unable to get my server working
Charry#0473: It works. Thank u! I didn't edit the client before
Ecconia#4929: Basically as <@!109262887310065664> already assumed, LogicWorld thinks that IPv4 is not available -> thus it uses IPv6. <[newline]> But it uses IPv6 on **server** AND **client** (can be seen in your logs). <[newline]> You have to "force" both to use IPv4 instead. <[newline]> **Server**: As already said in  `config.succ` you have to set `InternetProtocolOverride` to `IPv4`. <[newline]> **Client**: Here edit  `settings_master.succ` and set `MHG.Networking.Secret.InternetProtocolOverride` to `IPv4`. <[newline]>  <[newline]> <@!953494474955304993> Please tell me if I am wrong. <[newline]> But you should have gotten the  `Connection timed out` error when trying to connect to multiplayer, <[newline]>    before you got the `Integrated server exited unexpectedly` error. <[newline]> Because the first time the server gets created and LogicWorld fails to connect because of the settings above, <[newline]>    and the second time, the server is already running, so the server cannot be started a second time and crashes. <[newline]>  <[newline]> No worry, this bug will be fixed with the next update 0.91 ||although Jimmy did not confirm this yet, I bet he fixes it, there are so many players affected by this it hurts||.
Ecconia#4929: <@!953494474955304993> so you have a simple bug, which has a simple fix!
Charry#0473: I use the hotspot of my phone. And then i can enter the sandbox. But using a public WiFi (my school Internet), I can't enter
Charry#0473: 😭
Charry#0473: The same
Saltypretzel#0321: i helped translate it lol i should get back to translating it
Charry#0473: Not work
Charry#0473: I changed the language back to en
Saltypretzel#0321: Are you using chinese version of logic world
Charry#0473: It still crash.....<:bobby_sob:692807893023588363>
Charry#0473: Thank you, i will try then
GHXX#9078: thats the reason for this suggestion: <[newline]> "系统检测到在一个调用中尝试使用指针参数时的无效指针地址" translates to something regarding an invalid pointer, more specifically "The system detected an invalid pointer address in attempting to use a pointer argument in a call" it seems. Which led me to this SO post <[newline]> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12922736/invalid-pointer-address-error-attempting-to-connect-to-tcp-socket
GHXX#9078: and then change this from Default to IPv4
GHXX#9078: in the logic world installation directory
GHXX#9078: it seems odd that the game would say the integrated server crashed, when in fact, it really didnt crash, yet only connecting failed?
GHXX#9078: try setting the server to ipv4-only mode
Charry#0473: Sry there are some Chinese in it
Charry#0473: Here they are, thx
Charry#0473: 
GHXX#9078: what does the log say?
Charry#0473: How about this bug?
Charry#0473: The network bugs confused me all th e way 😢
jackson535#1361: the one ghxx and ecconia mentioned
jackson535#1361: also I should really try that mod at some point
jackson535#1361: epic
GUMMYCAT#6001: thank you, that worked. gunna start backing up more often
Ecconia#4929: I see. Well most of the bugs have been fixed and many more will be gone in 0.91, especially the network bugs. <[newline]> Okay thanks for the quick answer.
N_58#8502: I refunded the game. It looked like pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha early access. Waaay too buggy 🤷‍♂️🙂
Ecconia#4929: Hi, btw how is your playing going? <[newline]> I pretty much know what your bug is by now + how to fix it, to play properly. <[newline]> But first I would like to know if you still have this issue or not.
Ecconia#4929: <@!254675890854821890> (You do not accept DM's, hence sending this message here): <[newline]>  <[newline]> Hello~ <[newline]> You made a LogicWorld issue a while back: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/178> <[newline]> I am currently helping with sorting or cleaning up the issues posted. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Regarding this issue I would like to know: <[newline]> - Does this issue still happen? <[newline]> - Which LogicWorld version was this bug in? <[newline]> - Which operating system are you using? <[newline]> - How much RAM do you have? <[newline]>  <[newline]> Answering these questions would help resolving your issue 👍 <[newline]> (I got answers in DM by now.)
GHXX#9078: if you are running on windows or on linux (using proton, not native) its probs the access violation bdwgc bug :/  <[newline]> installing the load accelerator mod should duct tape fix it for you. Alternatively, simply turn down the render distance to the minimum before loading the world, and set it to any value after loading.
jackson535#1361: then the world probably won't crash. I have the same issue and that worked for me
jackson535#1361: then load that world, and pause as soon as it loads, for 5 or 10 seconds
jackson535#1361: try loading a small or empty world first
jackson535#1361: <@!267108295502725121> regarding https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/953036972815970314
_Noflare_#6621: I promise you that I will buy the game as soon as possible
Ecconia#4929: Nice, please buy the game if you like and use it 🙂
_Noflare_#6621: Thank you very much
_Noflare_#6621: OO its works
Ecconia#4929: That must not be an `O` though, it has to be a `Ω`.
_Noflare_#6621: 
_Noflare_#6621: I know I'm sorry but I really plan to buy it, 10$ is not that much
Ecconia#4929: Feels bad to help piracy of this game, but well testing is fair. But the current price of the game is too...
Ecconia#4929: Then where did you put the `ΩSubassemblies` file, cause I assume it is in the wrong folder. <[newline]> It should go in the `Logic_World_Data/Managed/` folder or something like this.
_Noflare_#6621: I use the pirate version just to test the game, I plan to buy it later
Ecconia#4929: Cause it does things which should not be done. In particularly that the `[ModLoader]` is loading the `ΩSubassemblies` file. Which is just straight odd. <[newline]> But that might be normal on Windows though, not sure. I use Linux. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Btw you can remove the `loglevel` thingy from that file again.
Ecconia#4929: Okay this looks very weird. Are you using the LogicWorld version bought on Itchi? Or is this the pirated version?
_Noflare_#6621: 
Ecconia#4929: Okay that is not much. <[newline]> Open `licc/autoexec.lsf` and insert `loglevel "trace"` and then start LW again. <[newline]> Send that log file then.
_Noflare_#6621: 
Ecconia#4929: -> Go in Steam, right click the LogicWorld game, browse local files. <[newline]> -> Open logs folder <[newline]> -> Send last log
_Noflare_#6621: Can't you just tell me how to find the logs?
Ecconia#4929: Should be okay, we can try
_Noflare_#6621: I am French so I don't speak English very well
Ecconia#4929: Then it would be helpful to have the content of your latest log file. To see if it contains an error. <[newline]> We could voice-chat if you don't mind.
_Noflare_#6621: yes i have a network connection
_Noflare_#6621: When starting the game
Ecconia#4929: <@!739157462602743938> When starting the game, before you see the main menu? <[newline]> If so, do you have a network connection? Are you using mods?
_Noflare_#6621: Hello I am blocked in the loading of the game
Ecconia#4929: So here is my very first sorting of when some bugs should be fixed. (And I am not near done sorting issues). <[newline]> And ignoring all the coming optimizations for 0.91, the list here is already burn-out material. <[newline]> We better give Jimmy some time to fix at least the first 3 columns... Cause that stuff is really annoying for some of us. 😅 <[newline]> [The list below is just my personal opinion of when issues should be handled, this does not reflect - but hopefully influence - what Jimmy does.] <[newline]> ||The first column is badly described, these are related to the coming floating-point rounding optimizations and should be fixed along with that. Oh and there are more columns, with less issue priority||
Ecconia#4929: You experienced the exact thing this mod was written for. Because it annoyed me too.
Cero#0516: Thanks a ton!!!
Ecconia#4929: For now you can get my mod "DisableCollision". Cause then you can place it no matter what LW collision says. <[newline]> Link here: <https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/910673109164638239/943156910507585556>
PseudoGoose#2841: i can hear the frustrated spam clicking from here. bzzt bzzt bzzt
Jimmy#8080: Will be fixed soon 🙏
Cero#0516: Lol the verifier is annoying me
circuitgamer77#0377: 
circuitgamer77#0377: I've only noticed it after leaving it open for five or six hours, but it could be showing up earlier - I've always just come back to my PC and noticed it playing.
Ecconia#4929: I tried this, but was not able to reproduce it. <[newline]> Maybe add whatever other music settings you have (like the pause stuff). <[newline]> But it might also only be a thing on Windows. Anyway more details help debugging. <[newline]> Btw, if you make an issue on the website for it, it won't drown in this channel. <[newline]> (And the estimated amount of time waited for it to start happening).
Brandi#4069: That's what I was thinking, awesome :)
Ecconia#4929: A good suggestion/solution would be to rename the `Server.exe` to `LogicWorldServer.exe`. Much less confusing, and much more easy to find.
Brandi#4069: Like I said, definitely not a major issue!
Brandi#4069: Ah, I should specify - while the popup is annoying, the rule name is based of the executable itself. The popup just gives you a heads-up and asks you to confirm a few rule options, not the name.
GHXX#9078: when you open a network socket, windows notices this and shows the popup iirc, so it isnt really a LW thing i'd say, at least not on purpose
Ecconia#4929: But isn't like the user creating the firewall rule by randomly clicking this super annoying firewall popup? <[newline]> (Is there even an API for this stuff? No clue.)
Brandi#4069: Hey! I'm not totally sure if this comes under the bug or issue category, but I thought I way as well mention it. The firewall rule's name for Logic World isn't set, and so Defender automatically sets it to the .exe filename (so its just called *server*).  It's not a huge problem or anything, but firewall rule names are usually descriptive of their application as to avoid confusion and worry. It definitely grabbed my attention as soon as I saw it.
circuitgamer77#0377: There's a chance I've already said this, but I can't remember - if LW is set to zero volume and stays open in the background without being focused, the game eventually starts playing the soundtrack at max volume, and stops as soon as the window is focused again.  I love the soundtrack, but it's still a weird bug.
Jimmy#8080: ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
zandy#3110: Awesome! Loving the game so far
Jimmy#8080: Will be fixed in 0.91 :)
zandy#3110: I suspect you already know about this, but the more you chain things together the worse the offset gets. I noticed while duplicating something and chaining it over and over that after a certain point the offset is very inaccurate. In this screenshot, all those individual circuit boards are supposedly directly connected to each other
Cero#0516: so, I guess it's a case by case basis
Cero#0516: But those have delay while fast buffer doesn't
Cero#0516: Yeah, I was thinking about that yesterday
circuitgamer77#0377: For if you want a different shaped buffer.
circuitgamer77#0377: By the way, you can use an and gate like a normal buffer with a differnt form - just tie both inputs together.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yep, buffers are super useful, especially when working with finer timings.
Cero#0516: Oh that's useful. Not knowing what buffers were, I've been using relay's with the on tied to the input
circuitgamer77#0377: Buffers in general only allow a signal to pass in one direction
circuitgamer77#0377: the fast buffer is instant
circuitgamer77#0377: A normal  buffer adds 1 tick
Cero#0516: and if one, what does the fast buffer do
Cero#0516: Does a buffer add one or two ticks
circuitgamer77#0377: You can sync that by adding a buffer to the directly connected input.
Cero#0516: Maybe I should have asked in <#901199821212352573> heh
Cero#0516: Oh that's pretty cool
circuitgamer77#0377: If you are referring to the brief flash, yep that's normal.  You have 0 ticks to one input of the AND gate, and 1 to the other input.
Reese4221#8317: looks like it yea
Cero#0516: Is this a normal tick?
Cero#0516: 
Ecconia#4929: Be warned, that if the current code has *no memory leak, you are not fixing the crash bug. You are only lowering the chances of it happening. <[newline]> And that means it can come back at a later time at even worse testing conditions. <[newline]> In the first place, there should not be any hard crashes. No matter how inefficient the code is. (Except it crashes with a semantically sane message)
PseudoGoose#2841: so maybe less dense worlds (fewer colliders per chunk on average) aren't affected as much by disabling colliders during loading?
PseudoGoose#2841: I don't know how Unity handles colliders internally, but a common optimization in engines is to group colliders into "chunks" based on their position/size, so you only have to check for collisions with colliders that are in the same chunks
GHXX#9078: <@!154964593397989376> since you were interested, so it doesnt get buried
Chime#3134: (can't shrink much further without damaging alu/display stuff heh)
Chime#3134: deleting most of the ram (left 16 bytes heh) cut the world size to 13k/13k components/wires and then it loads in seconds.  So those lovely connector pins are wonderful and don't change sim speed but they kill vanilla load performance, maybe
GHXX#9078: edit: loading in took 35 seconds with the mod (just tested)
GHXX#9078: this is our server world, the grid-size is default
GHXX#9078: e.g. the tetris world that you may or may not have seen before
GHXX#9078: i'd say roughly around your size, where it causes a crash, and larger
Chime#3134: what's a "large" world for these purposes?
GHXX#9078: i did hear though that the vanilla loading complexity is fairly high (when it comes to instantiating colliders), like O(n^2) or something, so, the larger the component? count gets the much worse the problem becomes, so the mod makes a much bigger impact the larger the world is
Chime#3134: shaved maybe a minute off.  Do we know if the issue is total part count or largest connected network?
GHXX#9078: odd, in my case it cuts down loading time from like 6-10 mins down to 1 min or so, but at least it loaded
Chime#3134: Yep, wasn't much faster but it did load successfully.
Chime#3134: trying now with the load accelerator, will report how that turns out
GHXX#9078: ah
GHXX#9078: tested on 3 different machines (two win machines where it broke and a linux native machine where it didnt broke, unless it was being run with proton)
Jimmy#8080: I'm not gonna bother testing until I've finished the current round of optimizations, which will almost certainly fix it anyway
GHXX#9078: if you want, you could get the save thats linked in the ticket that i linked and test using that <[newline]> that save file is known to cause this issue
Jimmy#8080: I also believe this is the case. Logic World uses the fancy next-gen garbage collector that isn't as battle tested as Unity's standard GC.
GHXX#9078: im suspecting it has to do with the unity garbage collector (bdwgc)
GHXX#9078: using that fixed the issue for me, or at least mitigated it to the point where larger component counts are possible, fyi
Chime#3134: not yet, but exploring that now
Jimmy#8080: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/910673109164638239/938755040800284703
Jimmy#8080: Have you tried Gnog's "fix the loading times" mod?
Chime#3134: yeah this takes about 12.5 minutes to load (old machine to be fair), shows me connecting etc and draws the initial screen... but never quite becomes responsive.  Lemme know if I can examine anything else.  Otherwise, have fun and don't fret~
Chime#3134: <:tentaclelove:710709791609323583>
Jimmy#8080: Working on better tech as we speak though :)
Jimmy#8080: Lol, I'm sorry it's not as scalable as I'd like it to be!
Chime#3134: im sorry i broke it 😆
Jimmy#8080: Cheers
Chime#3134: 
Jimmy#8080: If you click on the sandbox in the "singleplayer" menu you can view some statistics about it without loading. Can you let me know the component & wire counts?
Chime#3134: the .dmp cores are about 22MB
Chime#3134: Sandbox #3 is 3.7MB; it's the one I posted in builds yesterdayish after placing two ram pages
GHXX#9078: there are a few workarounds: <[newline]> you can reduce the render distance to the minimum before loading, and then turn it back up when the world is loaded. <[newline]> or, you could grab the loadaccelerator mod, which, in my case made if more stable. I used to crash quite often, but havent crashed since i installed it. Not sure if it does have an impact though, or if it was something else that changed randomly
Chime#3134: the stack frames I skipped were all unhandled exception handling and trying to print out the illuminating message "Crashed!!!" 😉
Chime#3134: (I was looking at the resulting minidump with vs2019)
Chime#3134: hm!  Might be
GHXX#9078: done quite some digging, hence the large amount of edits. Seems to be somehow related to memory use rising beyond 4GB during worldload (afterwards its fine) <[newline]> Affected platforms are Windows, Linux (Proton), but not linux native
GHXX#9078: might be this bug then https://logicworld.net/tracker/284
Chime#3134: stupidly large because I was messing with ram modules; checking world size.  This is on win10 x86_64 in this case.
GHXX#9078: and additionally, what OS are you running on?
Jimmy#8080: I've not heard of that, but I think I know what's going on based on the error. How big is this world? (in terms of component/wire count)
Chime#3134: I'm seeing a crash-to-desktop immediately after world load; seems to be stack overflow from recursion in `UnityPlayer!physx::Sq::IncrementalAABBTree::releaseNode + 0x42` known issue and/or dumps desired?
Ecconia#4929: Maf! (Currently confirming bug reports). Trying to break my Audio by being high up. But does not work for me. <[newline]> But I did have times in the past, when my Discord voice chat was totally robot - because of LW
Ecconia#4929: Ahh okay, yes! (Makes sense) **Edit**: When you totally take away the space for layouting. (Here only horizontal scrolling would help - pain - its fair to not improve this).
Ecconia#4929: **Edit**: I was confused by this, since on the right side of the keybinding cards, there is still a lot of space. So the game does not use this space to the fullest.
jackson535#1361: I figured that out, but I was really slow to react so I ended up doing it near the end
Flampt#3906: You do know you can click when it says mousehatgames and it will skip it?
Ecconia#4929: High-Level complains be like... <[newline]> I want like at least 1024², can't loose to competition. ||That's a joke, don't use such high resolution.||
jackson535#1361: 
jackson535#1361: also good idea
jackson535#1361: bizzare. the combination of loading a different world prior and pausing when I join the problematic one is really the workaround
Ecconia#4929: Btw do you have the `loadaccelerator` mod. It should at least speed up your join process a bit. Can only recommend it. <[newline]> <https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/910673109164638239/938755040800284703> <[newline]> Maybe it has other positive effects too - who knows.
jackson535#1361: actually gimme a minute, I didn't test the combination of loading an empty world and then pausing when the big world finally loads
Ecconia#4929: Bruh, also have that on my Laptop. Ain't going over 23 FPS at all.
jackson535#1361: for some reason I'm also getting low framerate in empty worlds
jackson535#1361: also yeah idk why
jackson535#1361: ffs it's not opening at all now
Ecconia#4929: Yeah, I just tried it anyway. It takes a bit, but it loads perfectly for me first try. <[newline]> So very likely the problem is related to LW on Windows. <[newline]> Sick, I only get like 24 FPS
jackson535#1361: otherwise it crashes
jackson535#1361: yes but I had to go through that process I described in order for it to work
Ecconia#4929: You can use it again? Should I still try to load it? (It probably will work for me, unless the file is literally corrupted). <[newline]> (Linux has very few loading issues, like actually none at all - for me).
jackson535#1361: my computer wasn't really under load or anything that would cause a difference
jackson535#1361: 15 seconds vs 45 seconds if I had to guess
jackson535#1361: the other 2 times I booted up logic world and went straight for the normal world I was trying to open, which crashed after a few seconds like i said
jackson535#1361: I don't know if pausing did anything
jackson535#1361: and then it worked
jackson535#1361: the fact that the world took a lot longer to load after I loaded an empty world first is really weird
GHXX#9078: but installing the load accelerator mod also helped a ton
GHXX#9078: i hope that this access violation bug gets fixed soon, as it is quite annoying
circuitgamer77#0377: I know the exact solution - I had the identical bug for a while.  Turn your render distance to minimum (30) before loading the world.  After it loads you can turn it back up.
GHXX#9078: did it crash?
jackson535#1361: so it was probably like 2.5
jackson535#1361: with the map loaded and now with extra stuff, it's at 3.3gb
jackson535#1361: hm
jackson535#1361: probably not but still
jackson535#1361: I can check
GHXX#9078: <@!491262532917657600>
GHXX#9078: did the game use more than 4GB of memory during loading the map? (in the bug i used to encounter, usually mem-use just below 4GB and then mem use spikes up as it finishes loading, and then the game shows the map, freezes and closes)
jackson535#1361: dindows 10 pro version 1909
GHXX#9078: are you on windows or running the proton-Linux version?
jackson535#1361: ok
Ecconia#4929: Keep a backup of your backups. I can try to load your world once back home. <[newline]> (Backup folder of LW)
jackson535#1361: ok so I started it up a 3rd time. loaded a different world with just a single peg in it, and that was fine. then I went back to main menu and loaded the world I sent, and it took substantially longer than last time. eventually it loaded and I paused the game in hopes of it not crashing, and it was fine. I unpaused and now it's all working
jackson535#1361: woah
jackson535#1361: 
jackson535#1361: 
jackson535#1361: the logs don't seem to show anything, actually I'm not really sure what to post here in the event of a crash
jackson535#1361: it loads, then after a second or so lags badly, then the game exits instantly
jackson535#1361: I keep crashing a few seconds after I load my world
jackson535#1361: roh
Jimmy#8080: Will be fixed
jackson535#1361: therefore a level 100 bug xd
jackson535#1361: just realized that this means LW won't start unless you're connected to the internet. I really hope that's fixed in the next update. sometimes that's equivalent to a bugged executable that'll never launch / useless when I don't have internet or am running my computer in a mode where internet is not possible
Dragon Lord#6944: looks like fpe strikes again 😔
Arc#5873: ye i just deleted the chip and redid it
Ecconia#4929: That one is nasty, when you encounter the resize and the board is red. I think one MUST press `ESC` to not crash.
Arc#5873: Think I have found a crash bug, attempting to resize this circuit board with V  and a few others on this one chip I'm making on this map but none of the other chips are having this issue.  I press V and instead of the resize handles coming up the board goes red and then pressing V again causes a crash with this message.  The board isnt blocked from being resized as other copies of the board on the same chip are resizable.
Infini#5724: My terrible internet let's me place gates inside of gates if I catch it cutting out right. Pretty funny, I've so far made 2 long invertors and a fused switch
GHXX#9078: collision doesnt need to be turned off to cause this. basically just plop down two and gates and then increase the input counts
DADp#7461: its been reported
DADp#7461: this is common when rezising and gates
Erikbot#6368: did you use the disablecollision mod?
BitorBit#6268: hmmmmmmmmmm
CodeMaker_4#5396: 👍
Ecconia#4929: Not for the outlining specifically. Probably because there are way too many ways to cause these to bug. <[newline]> I only know one as side effect of clicking something else than a connector when multi wire placing. I hope it gets fixed this update.
CodeMaker_4#5396: 
CodeMaker_4#5396: Is there already a proper bugreport for this? I have investigated how and when it happens and was about to report it
Erikbot#6368: it can even affect the server state so it isn't purely visual
Ecconia#4929: <@!358990534619955200> here is the issue: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/104> <[newline]> ^Just confirmed, that this issue is still a thing.
Ecconia#4929: Wire outlining while MWP goes: Brrr
BitorBit#6268: but its already builded
Ecconia#4929: No his point was that LogicWorld has precision errors, while calculating the position and rotation of a component. And thus it is not aligned to the grid as it should be. And this causes collision for you, when you try to build something. <[newline]> And that is why you cannot build properly.
BitorBit#6268: i am not, i cant build it if this is happening
BitorBit#6268: ?
circuitgamer77#0377: He's experiencing a different problem (floating point)
Flampt#3906: Use the mod button to place the holder thing in the middle
Limón#7879: floating point error
BitorBit#6268: the higher you build, the more sideways the builds are
Ecconia#4929: Semi, but yes - that's indeed a readable message. <[newline]> The contrast must have confused me, was only able to read the light part. <[newline]> \***Edit**: Let me say it this way: "If the user sees the word 'Exception' the program is faulty." (Even in console).
Jimmy#8080: Thank you for investigating! This will be fixed for 0.91
Jimmy#8080: When you try to run a command and an exception is thrown, it's turned into a WriteLine. I think an exception is appropriate here because it's undefined behavior; you can't run a command on a server when you're not connected to a server!
Ecconia#4929: `throw new Exception` -> `LConsole.WriteLine` so easy <[newline]> In general it would be nice, to have a better "sender" system. *Looking at Minecraft - not good but better - at least existing* <[newline]>  <[newline]> Issue-ticket: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/315> (And I want this to be fixed, to make LW great again).
Ecconia#4929: Use feedback level **EXCEPTION** 😡 <[newline]> HOW DARE YOU TRY TO USE THIS COMMAND WHILE NOT BEING CONNECTED TO A SERVER?!
BitorBit#6268: usefull bug
Ecconia#4929: Your casual multi-select experience 😄 (Make a ticket for that too)
GUMMYCAT#6001: im confuse??
Ecconia#4929: Because the Linux build did not work? (there then)
Limón#7879: why use proton I thought there was a native Linux build
Erikbot#6368: ~~start practicing your gamer muscles~~
GUMMYCAT#6001: thats really time consuming for large boards though
Ecconia#4929: No, but do you know that you can move the board while holding it, using the JKLI keys or the ALT key? <[newline]> Btw feel free to create an issue on the website for it...
GUMMYCAT#6001: is there a fix for boards that cant be picked up from any point? such as when you pick up a board and it snaps to one of the corners?
slendi#2681: Thanks!
Ecconia#4929: AAAAND you have to set the overwrite for network protocol in `settings_master.succ` and `config.succ` to `IPv4`. <[newline]> Have fun. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Disclaimer: Lidgren and JimmysUnityUtilities are both available on GitHub. Hence I do not mind sharing these two DLL files. <[newline]> (While JimmysUnityUtilities is slightly customized for LW and this is probably an older version - I modded the DLL directly, while I build Lidgren from source). <[newline]> **With all these replacements and adjustments you remove IPv6 capability slightly though - if that matters.** (Cause config overwrite, and found UDP port will always be bound to IPv4 locally.)
Ecconia#4929: You will need `Lidgren.Network.dll`, which lets the network framework use loopback. (Replace in `Logic_World_Data/Managed/` and `Server/`). <[newline]> And `JimmysUnityUtilities.dll` which you only replace in `Logic_World_Data/Managed/`. Which allows the game to properly claim a free UDP port on loopback.
Ecconia#4929: 
Ecconia#4929: Guess what, I fixed it. Playing offline with LogicWorld now possible!
Ecconia#4929: OMG I literally fixed Lidgren by commenting out that `if` above 😄 <[newline]> But there is more Jimmy code, which fails to get a UDP port now ***SIGH*** <[newline]> (Another patch of mine now prints stacktraces to logs, super awesome *hint hint*) <[newline]> So also modded JimmiesUnityUtilities, since that also has no clue about loopback. And does not default to IPv4. <[newline]> But now I am having issues to apply Lidgren on the server... Ahh yes, the version is wrong
Ecconia#4929: The line above here, only causes a NullReferenceException, while Lidgren fails to get a MAC address, for whatever. <[newline]> Because it thinks it has no network interface, while it does have loopback (which it should use, if no others are present). <[newline]> In general should LogicWorld not be interface bound in the first place, unless overwritten in config. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Lol, Lidgren even skips interfaces which do not support IPv4, noice.
Ecconia#4929: And this is pretty much the reason why LogicWorld cannot run without a network interface. <[newline]> Because Lidgren (the UDP framework) does not support loopback. <[newline]> <@!154964593397989376> this might be interesting for you too.
Ecconia#4929: If you check the console, it probably has the error I sent above. <[newline]> Heh made a ticked for not printing stacktraces in console: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/314>
slendi#2681: nvm
Ecconia#4929: But does Singleplayer work now?
Ecconia#4929: Fun, for me that does not work, lol 😄
slendi#2681: aha!
slendi#2681: thanks
Ecconia#4929: Hmm
Ecconia#4929: <@!878313460960731147> okay fix for you, open `settings_master.succ` edit `MHG.Networking.Secret.InternetProtocolOverride:` to `IPv4` and see if the game starts then <[newline]> Could try that myself too though... <[newline]> -> Wrong string... let me test a bit more, cause now I get `Object reference not set to an instance of an object` :/
Ecconia#4929: So the message you see there is already the cause of the game not loading. That message must go away - the game must detect either IPv4 or IPv6 (annoyingly). <[newline]>  <[newline]> As reference, it uses this code to check if networks are available: <https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/JimmysUnityUtilities/blob/master/Scripts/Networking/NetworkUtilities.cs#L79> <[newline]> I wonder though why it fails to start though... Time to dig decompiled code, yay.
slendi#2681: https://youtu.be/sH-iJgVJLKo
slendi#2681: and this is on game load
slendi#2681: but i do have networking
Erikbot#6368: there is currently a bug where the game requires networking to run single player
slendi#2681: this is the log
slendi#2681: I'm on Linux and for some reason when I run the game and click the Start Game button, it gets stuck on the loading screen. When launched with Proton 7.0, the game loads but it cannot start an integrated server. What do I do?
LOOPS#1372: Yeah that works for me as well, but its still super annoying to work around. I've just been building things at ground level and moving them upwards which seems to work
circuitgamer77#0377: The way I've been getting around that specific bug is reversing the order I place the components - that almost always solves the problem with single component collisions for me.
Ecconia#4929: *improved <[newline]> -> To confirm, that it is real a collision problem, one can install my mod `DisableCollision` and then try to place things. <[newline]> If it works then, it is really the collision and hence probably a floating point error.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yet another case of floating point errors...  Getting fixed for the next update :)
LOOPS#1372: The components I mean ^^
LOOPS#1372: When ya stacking boards on top of eachother, very quickly it won't let you place them next to eachother. I can't place anything in these spaces above ^^^
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> I am not able to reproduce this when I download the save from the server. <[newline]> This means, that the server is already sending a "confusing" state to the client. <[newline]>  <[newline]> On my server the reproduction steps to get the first wire+undo bug only happens after you copy the contraption and then delete two boards then the wire and undo. <[newline]> It makes the click sound but the wire is invisible. But it also does not come back. <[newline]>  <[newline]> But well I fear the server state is borked in the first place. <[newline]> I won't restart the server. So one could still debug this problem as a client. <[newline]> Maybe there is a way to even memory dump the server. No clue.
Ecconia#4929: I also was able to delete a wire and control+Z did not visibly bring it back - while it did do the sound.
Ecconia#4929: This is reproduceable. Not a fresh world though.
Ecconia#4929: So far so good...
Ecconia#4929: Yeah that sounds way too complex... I need to reproduce it in my world first...
Jimmy#8080: Ideally in a fresh world
Jimmy#8080: I would very much appreciate reliable reproduction steps from you
Ecconia#4929: Should I dig deeper, or is there a possibility that you figure this out on your own? <[newline]> (Cause unpacking this display is not much fun...)
Jimmy#8080: aaaaaaaah yeah undo would do it
Ecconia#4929: So the server is fine. It is just my client that got borked. <[newline]> I roughly remember the steps I did. <[newline]> Much undo...
Ecconia#4929: ...Guess I just start another LW instance to check with another player.
Ecconia#4929: -> It might be only on client side, since the Displays show the correct value. So it is only a visual bug.
Ecconia#4929: But it might be, that the server is actually corrupted
Ecconia#4929: Sadly I did not. However, it is currently on my tutorial server. I did not restart that one in weeks. <[newline]> I fear if I restart it is fixed. I could rejoin with my client to see if that fixes it.
Jimmy#8080: have you found a way to reliably reproduce this issue?
Stefan#5422: I assume this is tick stopped?
Ecconia#4929: I hate this
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Ok, just tried to replicate the FP error in unity. Managed to make a rather large stack of rotated and offset cubes. 0.9 offset, 90 rotation. The error was negligible. But I did notice that when setting the parent transform, a sizable error was introduced. So perhaps if Jimmy adjusts it such that the local offset and rotation are set after setting the parent object, the FP error issue could be largely resolved.
nemerod#0256: you need know the offset for all board and location
nemerod#0256: in LW, the peg board with small size, it's 1 per 1 with 0.5
nemerod#0256: you get error with the time 🙂
nemerod#0256: thank for the test 🙂 <[newline]> he made with small value but the idea it's here
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: This is a proof of concept. With matrix transformations rotation gets involved and affects the results. And the in game results will differ, but the concept still stands.
nemerod#0256: the RGB color space with color per channel with 0 to 1 <[newline]> it's very very bad idea <[newline]> burned 4 byte in memory for just 256 possibility
nemerod#0256: green line it's correct value with no error
nemerod#0256: 
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: But with objects aligned with offsets of 0.25, the results of the matrix multiplications are numbers that are multiples of .25. Likewise with 0.3. 0.3 causes significant rounding errors at low itterations like 15 or so. But .25 can handle much more like 100 or maybe even 1000, not sure just how much.
nemerod#0256: minimum add allowed with 65000 <[newline]> 0.003
nemerod#0256: you cant add 0.000001 with 65000
nemerod#0256: the float have error with tiny value and big value on same time
nemerod#0256: right 🙂
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: The problem occurs from a series of unity transform matrixes multiplied together because of nested game objects. Those matrixes are made of floats yes. And cannot be changed(which is why I'm almost certain jimmy will have to change the grid scale). But the operation of a series of matrix multiplications is not the same as .25 + 0.00001.
nemerod#0256: 256 bit per float with 236 bit for the fraction number <[newline]> 19 bit for the exponent <[newline]> 1 sign
nemerod#0256: exemple the Octuple-precision floating-point
nemerod#0256: you need cheat and made custom float
nemerod#0256: you cant get more with the float 😦
nemerod#0256: exemple the PI constant in float it's  <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> 3.1415927 <[newline]> ```
nemerod#0256: the sign have 1 bit for negate or no
nemerod#0256: the fraction in float value have 23 bit, but he turned on correct value with the exponent (8 bit)
nemerod#0256: he have same problem with the last number
nemerod#0256: ``` <[newline]> 0.24999994 <[newline]> 0.24999995 <[newline]> 0.24999997 <[newline]> 0.24999998 <[newline]> 0.25000000 <[newline]> 0.25000002 <[newline]> 0.25000005 <[newline]> 0.25000010 <[newline]> 0.25000011 <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> all possibility near the value 0.25
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: With 0.25, the mantissa is all 0's. And when iteratively added, the exponent increases and rounding does not occur for a very long time. Eventually the difference in the exponent will cause the smaller number that's added to have no effect all together. But that doesn't occur until the numbers differ by over a billion or so. Actually I think it's close to 2^24 difference in value.
nemerod#0256: ``` <[newline]> 0999.99975 <[newline]> 0999.99980 <[newline]> 0999.99990 <[newline]> 0999.99993 <[newline]> 1000.00000 <[newline]> 1000.00006 <[newline]> 1000.00010 <[newline]> 1000.00020 <[newline]> 1000.00024 <[newline]> ``` <[newline]>  <[newline]> all possibility near the value 1000
nemerod#0256: but with big value the error can get very fast
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I get the concept of accumulated floating point error. In floating point, the mantissa of 0.3 is a repeating pattern. That causes the rounding errors to happen much more frequently and add up much more quickly.
nemerod#0256: you cant get the value 2.0000001
nemerod#0256: exemple with value <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> 2.0000000 <[newline]> 2.0000002 <[newline]> 2.0000004 <[newline]> 2.0000007 <[newline]> 2.0000010 <[newline]> ```
nemerod#0256: you have only 23 bit (24 with negate value)
nemerod#0256: not possible infini precision after the point
nemerod#0256: check the last board location
nemerod#0256: copy the first board and add on the last board then made same action
nemerod#0256: then trying made the board on board then board on board and repeat the step several time
nemerod#0256: check the current location
nemerod#0256: if you trying ingame get the location per component
nemerod#0256: for info , the float work but he can get error with the time <[newline]> if you add just 0.25 you can <[newline]> but after if you add 60 then add 0.25 <[newline]> you can get small error with the float no effect for now <[newline]> but later yes
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I vaguely recall jimmy saying he was going to try to fix floating point error in .91. I know for sure he's going to try and fix it, and even said he'll adjust grid size away from .3 if absolutely necessary. I think .25 would be awesome. But, 0.296875 or even 0.30078125 should be enough.
nemerod#0256: too many relative math in float on same value <[newline]> WOLRD > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card > board card <[newline]>  <[newline]> (edit: i see your react before and your message edited, and i have your original message)
Ecconia#4929: Yeah, true that. Well I sent a save with this issue to Jimmy ages ago -> It should be possible to debug this bug using that. <[newline]> ||Ages = like prolly 5 years||
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Floating point error could cause detection of non-existing collision. Don't know if that's actually the case though.
Ecconia#4929: And why would they be fixed in the next update?
Ecconia#4929: How is that a floating point error? (Edit: As in 100% that cause, it could be something else).
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm pretty sure that one's from floating point errors.  Should be fixed in the next update :)
Wiktuur#5715: Can't resize board after building on it - happens sometimes, but don't know why <[newline]> Edit: After moving a couple times board can be resized properly
GHXX#9078: https://tenor.com/view/kek-kekw-gif-19460649
Jimmy#8080: Network? More like notwork! gotem
Ecconia#4929: The good old "no network, no LW" bug is still a thing.
Jimmy#8080: glad to hear it 👍
sorgan71#6324: It just started working idk why
Jimmy#8080: Have you tried reinstalling the game? (Back up your saves before you do this)
Jimmy#8080: (continued from <#401255675264761868> ) <@!195330504021639168> have you been able to launch Logic World before on this machine, or is this the first time you've tried to?
nemerod#0256: i have idea why your no have pin with the floating point <[newline]> your socket connector have too many card on card .......
Dragon Lord#6944: woah! Socket with no pin
cheese3660#8641: floating point be like
Jimmy#8080: Will be fixed in 0.92 (can't happen any sooner for long and uninteresting reasons)
Jimmy#8080: Yeah that's why it's still a secret world haha
RyanT#1426: <@!154964593397989376>, I loaded into the TUNG world, and it looks like a nuke went off there
Dragon Lord#6944: discovered one earlier today in MiniStumpy's server: <[newline]> if you are in a server and the server host kills the server, you get disconnected /j <[newline]> ||I thought i broke the server with singers because he didn't warn me lol||
circuitgamer77#0377: Found a new one - I have my master audio set to 0 right now and I have "mute in background" turned on, but I just came back to my computer after leaving the game on the pause menu and not focused and it was playing one of the songs.  As soon as I focused the game again it stopped.  I love the soundtrack, but I thought I should report the bug anyway :)
Crevette#1444: ^^
Crevette#1444: Ok
Jimmy#8080: <@!381912457519562772>
Jimmy#8080: I added this to the FAQ, since I get asked it every so often. https://logicworld.net/view/pst-c032a587/logic-world-faq#cmt-50066cdc <[newline]> > I decided not to include real-world flags in the gameplay because I want the fantasy world to be firmly separate from the real world. However, later in EA I will be overhauling Flags so that you can create custom designs for them; when that happens it will be easy to recreate most real-world flags.
DanielGJ44#4557: Not sure if you can still place flags in the game files to get them to load in or not - I'd assume no
DanielGJ44#4557: Actual flag maker coming soon though
DanielGJ44#4557: The feature was removed because real world flags are bad
Crevette#1444: or is just desable..............
Crevette#1444: 
Crevette#1444: 
Crevette#1444: 
Crevette#1444: You can't put custom images on flags
Dragon Lord#6944: You might be able to get more precise vertical placement with standoffs
IDoget#3748: *sophisticated test box*
RyanT#1426: not even this works
Dragon Lord#6944: Literally unplayable
RyanT#1426: the chairs collision box includes the hole on the bottom
Ecconia#4929: Just a place for me to rank about memory usage of LogicWorld and how super unoptimal this is for the
Ecconia#4929: Lol no - I do control like each object and decide for the size of data myself. Just JVM overhead per existing object. <[newline]> Only god knows how Unity rapes LW there.
Erikbot#6368: did openTUNG use anywhere near this amount of memory?
Erikbot#6368: somewhere in `help`
Erikbot#6368: I think I saw a debug command for that
Ecconia#4929: Uff, Btw there was no way to trigger GC right? Only a toggle?
gnog#2259: imagine openLW in c with 16 bytes of ram used for single component
Erikbot#6368: I assume it is memory that isn't getting freed, since adding and removing something large increases memory usage by a large amount
Ecconia#4929: same...
Erikbot#6368: I genuinely wonder what is using all that memory
Erikbot#6368: just my (very part optimized) 128x128 display is 20MB
Ecconia#4929: Mine is like 23MB, with almost only the display. So yeah.
Erikbot#6368: although the file is 35MB
Erikbot#6368: LW used 20 gb for me...
Ecconia#4929: Whoop, and suddenly LW uses 12GB out og my 15Gb.  So uncool and not helpful. <[newline]> Like how can we even dream of big builds? <[newline]> I hope that most of that is gonna be garbage collected. <[newline]> Well one more GB until my OS freezes. <[newline]>  <[newline]> (I grabbed my display btw)
Erikbot#6368: are any sockets missaligning due to fp issues? If you can just walk through the circuit, it has not updated.
NeverCast#1448: half the circuit isn't working
NeverCast#1448: Sometimes it seems the simulation graph doesn't update after a paste operation, is there a way to force rebuilding?
Space Cowboy#7931: I'll give it a go, thank you so much!
CrispyPin#1149: should fix it
CrispyPin#1149: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/910673109164638239/938755040800284703
Space Cowboy#7931: I didn't even think of looking for mods online. Most of my googling for "logic world" return Logitech software haha
Space Cowboy#7931: The save in question is around 10mbs so that definitely checks out. I just hit play and let it do its thing, and it was fully loaded in like 15-20 minutes?
CrispyPin#1149: unless you install the loadaccelerator mod it can take >10 minutes to load a 10mb file
CrispyPin#1149: how long have you waited?
Space Cowboy#7931: Hi everyone, have you ever experienced an issue with loading a particular save? I swear I had it working just fine last night, but when I woke up this morning to continue the save... It wouldn't load. No crash, no error message, just refused to load.
ThaCuber#5611: i mean, how can you fix floating point error, isn't that the computer's problem?
Erikbot#6368: Jimmy seems to want to have it solved in 0.91 according to this message: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/919749436966572093
ThaCuber#5611: hold on, trying to fix floating point error??
Erikbot#6368: ram and cpu usage
Limón#7879: thats absurd
Erikbot#6368: **The ram and CPU usage in logic world seems higher than would be reasonable. ** <[newline]>  <[newline]> **2GB** at the main menu. <[newline]>  <[newline]> **9GB** in a normal **10MB** world, there was 1-2 full cores worth of cpu usage even when the simulation is paused.  <[newline]>  <[newline]> Tried placing 64\*64\*128\*4=**2097152** boards in an empty new world (**128MB** save) to estimate ram usage per board (and try and exclude other things that where not dependent on the number of boards, and ram usage was** 27GB**.  <[newline]> This means there is about **13000 bytes used per board**. <[newline]>  <[newline]> This was tested on a linux system running native logic world with 64 GB of ram.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yep, floating point error - should be fixed soon
That Guy#1215: the more you place the more offset stuff gets
That Guy#1215: if you place a mount, then a board ontop, then another mount ontop of the board and then another board just over and over
That Guy#1215: 
That Guy#1215: hold on
That Guy#1215: wait no
That Guy#1215: slightly too big fast buffer
That Guy#1215: 
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I'm pretty sure they've transcended us mortals
PillburyDohBoy2#0651: dang i wish i could place parts that percisely
Reese4221#8317: but that could be problematic
Reese4221#8317: could make it so you can put custom labels on them
Ecconia#4929: Figured, its probably okay. And that is a good solution though. <[newline]> Sadly on my Linux the `Keyboard` thing provided by Unity is `null`, that's worse than wrong language. <[newline]> But there already exists a ticket for that. <[newline]> Edit: One could add the key-names to the language translation.
Jimmy#8080: Lol sorry. Currently the game asks the OS for the key names, but as you can see this approach has problems. I'd like to do something different but I'm not quite sure what the ideal solution is.
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: oof
gnog#2259: 
BitorBit#6268: i will fix it
Ecconia#4929: That sounds so awful to fix...
Ecconia#4929: Hmm so my game is set to English. So is Windows. <[newline]> But the keyboard and formats are German. <[newline]> Why does the game assume I understand German key names suddenly 😱
BitorBit#6268: the blocks also clip into each other, some gets invis,than you see random triangles & some glitches happen, your fps drops to 0, cpu max, all of my 32GB ram is filling until it crashes, my RTX is at 100%
BitorBit#6268: from what i know
BitorBit#6268: none of that
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: cleint side lag or the server tps drops?
BitorBit#6268: the game is keeping freezing while on servers
nemerod#0256: thank the mod XD
BitorBit#6268: ok
nemerod#0256: dont worry, we just disable the hitbox on all component XD
Dragon Lord#6944: but yeah lol
Dragon Lord#6944: 'twas a pun
IDoget#3748: luckily i was able to find it before it was put into a massive computer and i had to search for like a hour

EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: ~~GHXX says this might be your fault Jimmy:~~
gunna#2218: i know the all mighty jimmy will banish it back to bug world no problem ur the best jimmy praise jimmy
gunna#2218: that is grate to know i thought this was something that would actually affect me lol
reklrekl#3271: this happens when changing the pin count of gates, that are already wired. <[newline]> reloading the save fixes this, no need for removing and rewiring
gunna#2218: in the video that and gate is bugging the hell out then when i delete it it fixes so weird how am i gonna ever recover from things like this this ain't vacuum tube simulator lol no offence to jimmys great all mighty work though jimmy is love jimmy is life
gunna#2218: this is the link it will be at when its done https://youtu.be/I69nHLvDtNA
gunna#2218: hold up i gotta upload it to youtube bc discord hates files over 50mb /:
gunna#2218: the first thing to ever make me feel insane while trying to build in this game was the floating point errors but those are about to be history hopefully the same can be said for whatever is going on here bc this made me feel even more mad and just entirely like i lost my mind
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: That I'm looking at
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: The first one is me
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: 
binaryclock03#5762: guess its not a secret anymore

autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: secret world? i require information
autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: whats up with the corner mode on higher border thicknesses
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Moving platforms on the secret world move even when paused, literally unplayable.
PseudoGoose#2841: oof
BitorBit#6268: found a bug <[newline]>  <[newline]> 1. go to multiplayer button(server list) <[newline]> 2. disconect/change internet <[newline]> 3. game dies(crashes)
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I told Jimmy, he can do what he wishes with it now
Saltypretzel#0321: there used to be a bug where you could undo and glitch many things together, but like that wasnt dangerous or anything
Saltypretzel#0321: to server or what
Saltypretzel#0321: disruption?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: It could cause disruption, it's not the end of the world or anything
binaryclock03#5762: its not like you can give yourself 999 diamonds or something
binaryclock03#5762: how do you have an exploitable bug in LW?
GHXX#9078: i suggest exploits should be disclosed after they have been fixed
Jimmy#8080: Feel free to DM me :)
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: That doesn't seem to include a private setting, it would be posted publicly
Dragon Lord#6944: is that what you're looking for?
Dragon Lord#6944: https://logicworld.net/tracker/game
Dragon Lord#6944: check the bug tracker
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Where do we put exploitable bugs and issues?
circuitgamer77#0377: That's a bug on singleplayer too - I haven't found a solution besides alt-f4, but it seems to happen when the game crashes and I restart.  The first time after I restart I get that.
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I just had a weird bug where I connected to a server, but none of the boards were there, players were still and I couldn't use any menus. I had to alt+F4 out. I should have taken a screenshot
DADp#7461: should be
binaryclock03#5762: thats what It seems like
circuitgamer77#0377: My guess is that the server isn't sending packets fast enough to the client, but I don't know much about that so don't trust me there.
binaryclock03#5762: Changing render distances and graphics options doesnt seem to change anything
binaryclock03#5762: so far I haven't really found what could be causing it, it just happens randomly and restarting the server seems to help sometimes. But it starts when the server has been up for about 2-3 days and then it just randomly starts and stops. Sometimes it will appear for 5 min and then disappear for 30min, sometimes it'll just stick around until we restart
binaryclock03#5762: its weird because it seems to only effect the players (it effects all players at the same time). The logic seems to be calulating fine and without delay but button presses and the visuals are all kinda delayed as shown in the gif above
binaryclock03#5762: it shouldnt be jumping around randomly
binaryclock03#5762: well it doesnt seem to be going back to normal but it should be switching between them from right to left with a 1 tick delay
binaryclock03#5762: hold on lemme wait for it to go back to normal to show what it should look like
binaryclock03#5762: https://gyazo.com/0b527eaaf59ff509194591ebeaf93743
binaryclock03#5762: whats up with updates not being rendered properly, as in wire state updates
KyleRokuKyu#6975: Doap
circuitgamer77#0377: Floating point error, should be fixed in the next update :)
KyleRokuKyu#6975: As it goes up, the gap increases. <[newline]> I think this might contribute to blocking copy pasta when there's nothing that should block
KyleRokuKyu#6975: 
KyleRokuKyu#6975: Now, I'mma post a pic from the bottom
KyleRokuKyu#6975: Here's a fun one... <[newline]>  <[newline]> This is at the top of a tall vertical stack of copy pasta...
GUMMYCAT#6001: messes up pretty bad for components on multiple planes
ThePiGuy24#0369: select with Z (or whatever key you have bound) then pick them up with G (or whatever key you have bound)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: how do you drag several components at once? :o
GUMMYCAT#6001: seems like this is just a broken board
GUMMYCAT#6001: it did it again
GUMMYCAT#6001: was trying to drag multiple components and i lost control, couldnt cancel and was unable to open any menus. had to end process to close the game
BitorBit#6268: hey ecconia, you know any popular serever?
Ecconia#4929: This looks like you have multiple components in one spot.
Broyojo#2667: oh no
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: 
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: lmao
HomelikeBrick42#1173: then the second time you press crouch then it actually crouches
HomelikeBrick42#1173: and press crouch it does nothing because it is trying to "uncrouch" even though you are not crouching
HomelikeBrick42#1173: and then stop flying
HomelikeBrick42#1173: if you crouch and then fly

circuitgamer77#0377: It's an amazing game :)
circuitgamer77#0377: If I remember correctly Jimmy's working on fixing it in the next update.
gunna#2218: i can't wait to see this game soar
gunna#2218: yeah this has 1000% potental
gunna#2218: lol that is exactly one of my guesses
circuitgamer77#0377: Floating point errors - should be fixed soon.
gunna#2218: why does that happen
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Uhh
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: 
circuitgamer77#0377: I know, I just wanted to make the joke :)
nemerod#0256: all move and mouse have now reverse setting, left = right, look up = look down, any = -any
nemerod#0256: no, but not bad idea XD <[newline]> he used the commande in console and change the player scale with negate number
circuitgamer77#0377: Should gravity be inverted now?
circuitgamer77#0377: Perfect :)
nemerod#0256: playerscale have something maybe XD

gunna#2218: the freeze is a exprience i couldn't record
gunna#2218: that is about another glitch im talking about the line that goes to the sky in that video

gunna#2218: idk what that is looks like a wire going into the sky
gunna#2218: but i post this bc of that line to the left
gunna#2218: also idk if its isolated to me but when i tried to take a screenshot with 4x reslution it frooze up for like 3 sec them it turned the whole screen just turned black completly unresponsive had to hard restart

autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: intended feature I'd say
autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: oh right neat
Limón#7879: it's fucking floating
Limón#7879: look at the top one
autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: gotta press alt or Ctrl to precision place it
autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: the white stick
autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: no that's an issue with that component
Dragon Lord#6944: i think fixed point is fixed precision... it's just an int that is interpreted as being that int divided by a constant value (essentially shifting the decimal a set amount)
Ecconia#4929: *fixed precision... (I heavily doubt you can just tell unity to use a different position variable... But maybe. Is fixed precision fixed point?)
Dragon Lord#6944: (jimmy said he'll have that fixed soon™️ by replacing floats with fixed point numbers)
Dragon Lord#6944: yay for floating point errors 😩

Jimmy#8080: It definitely will be when modding is officially supported
GHXX#9078: oh thats great news
Jimmy#8080: It should be? I'm not sure
GHXX#9078: speaking of code loading at runtime, is it possible to run c# code in a mod, without adding any modded components?
Jimmy#8080: And anyways, the performance improvements of il2cpp are expected to be surpassed when Unity upgrades from mono to .NET 6 next year
GHXX#9078: and it also screws with stuff like harmony
Jimmy#8080: There are no plans to, as it prevents loading mod code at runtime
GHXX#9078: please dont ever use il2cpp, k ty
Jimmy#8080: Logic World does not use il2cpp.
Erodros#6037: Wait is it possable to us harmoney?  I thought was using that new il2cpp.  be nice if I could link rebooting my server to discord
Erodros#6037: no crashes in 4 days so far, just 8 min game loads, ugh so embarsed
Verlio_H#0201: 3rd amendment moment
Jimmy#8080: Networking is hard as shit lol
Jimmy#8080: Yeah that stuff definitely needs to be improved
GHXX#9078: or have a pingpong server to check if v4 is possible and use that primarily, otherwise fallback to v6
GHXX#9078: maybe that should be made the default
NitramiuZ#4145: I had to change from default to IPv4
NitramiuZ#4145: Now my game works
NitramiuZ#4145: Nvm I had to change it in the settings_master file
NitramiuZ#4145: How do I change the internet protocol? The setting in the config.succ file doesn't seem to change anything
Ecconia#4929: This method could also be abused to put images into comments... hehehe <[newline]> Ofc also to put new images into old threads.

thalann#4241: My patches fixes incompatibility with Gecko and WebKit.
thalann#4241: Ah, I should have been more clear. It is for the web site.
GHXX#9078: but  i dont think there is an official place for such patches
GHXX#9078: could make a mod that applies it using harmony or something
thalann#4241: Yes, for the bugs.
GHXX#9078: patches?
thalann#4241: Where do I submit patches?
Nano#8786: https://logicworld.net/tracker/293
Nano#8786: Woops website bug made me double submit
Nano#8786: bad pipe
Nano#8786: oo no filter on the bugs
Jimmy#8080: Submit an issue there with as much detail as possible. Ideally, include step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
Jimmy#8080: https://logicworld.net/tracker
Nano#8786: What is the bug report process
NitramiuZ#4145: My network situation is a bit unusual, but I'll try to restart my computer and see if it works then
Dragon Lord#6944: That's really weird... Typically inside of your home network is considered a DMZ (demilitarized zone) so you shouldn't have any difficulty connecting to it as long as you have the right IP. Have you checked to make sure that you're actually using the local IP and not the global one? If you're using the global one it might have a difficulties because it's not port forwarded
NitramiuZ#4145: Could it have something to do with a internal firewall or something?
NitramiuZ#4145: I just bought the game but I can't connect to the local server on my first test world
pipe01#7194: Should be working now

nemerod#0256: Region = france
nemerod#0256: Not possibl create account on your website
Limón#7879: a bit of ram
nemerod#0256: my god, you no have good cache memory inside your CPU 😦
nemerod#0256: i have GTX780 Ti founder edition from nvidia with driver never updated from the first setup, i programming my update and i can launche any game with no problem, steam VR work very well
circuitgamer77#0377: I think my CPU is my weak point:
Erodros#6037: pushes my RTX 2080:P
circuitgamer77#0377: It's a gigantic save
Erodros#6037: ya
circuitgamer77#0377: Logic World always maxes out my RTX 3060.
nemerod#0256: not pretty good for 35 min for loading game
Erodros#6037: its getting to that point
Erodros#6037: once its loaded
Erodros#6037: graphics work fine
Erodros#6037: I mean
Erodros#6037: Nah ryizan 7 desktop
circuitgamer77#0377: PC, custom built, pretty good specs.
nemerod#0256: you have tower or laptop computer ?
Erodros#6037: Yea its why I was confused, wasn't getting any errors on the server, and it just seemed like it was loading, but then "do you want to wait for this app" would come up
nemerod#0256: if the server launched but the game crash after loading game, it's not your save map, but the render engine user at 999999999999..9.9...9999 (portal 2 leave my message please)
circuitgamer77#0377: I have a world that takes around 35 minutes to load at the moment, but the server finishes loading almost instantly, and seems to start simulating while the client is still loading.
Erodros#6037: I can't tell you the nightmares I have had with stationeers
Erodros#6037: but  I am just happy the saves are stable
Erodros#6037: yea thats what I was noticing
nemerod#0256: the server not need the visual
nemerod#0256: but if the pending update list memory very small or no free space, too many info not good for the gpu, and the render engine stopped work and game crash after
circuitgamer77#0377: The loading times are going to be fixed soon - the server loads really fast, but the client takes forever (possibly from collider loading, but I don't know that that's been confirmed).
nemerod#0256: but on the first frame, your GPU need update all content from waiting list after loading screen
nemerod#0256: he used 1 core for convert your save to data for your GPU
nemerod#0256: normal, it's your CPU work for what the GPU need show after loading screen
Erodros#6037: Didn't use the gpu till the last second then foomp
nemerod#0256: trying true borderless
Erodros#6037: It still looks like a loading issue for the wait though, was profiling it though visual studio
nemerod#0256: never use the alt+tab with full screen
Erodros#6037: yea that was it
circuitgamer77#0377: Reducing render distance has always stopped crashes though
nemerod#0256: disable the full-screen
circuitgamer77#0377: alt-tab for me always looks like it crashes it for longer load times, but it's always fixed itself just by waiting.
nemerod#0256: the render engine no appreciate too many element on same frame by the game, maybe fixed on next update
nemerod#0256: then trying again
nemerod#0256: downgrade the setting ingame to minimal value
nemerod#0256: disable the overlay by ANY software (steam too)
nemerod#0256: close your firefox, chrome, epic game launched, battle.net, riot game, discord, for release the VRAM on your GPU and your computer
nemerod#0256: trying check your GPU and total memory free on your computer and your GPU
nemerod#0256: if you have large map, just keep wait
Erodros#6037: It also dosn't help alt tabing seems to kill the loading process too
Erodros#6037: oh god thankyou that was it
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: lower it to 30
nemerod#0256: trying with 150 for your game, and trying again and give the time to your game, i need 1 minute for load 1 large map <[newline]> with render distant too big,n the game show 1 frame then game exit
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then im good once im in
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thats what happens to me
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: giv e it 20 mins to load
Erodros#6037: I mean it is a 10 meg save with like 4 people projects on it hah
Erodros#6037: oh god it can't be that easy...wait can it?
nemerod#0256: trying reduct the render distance to extreme short for load, i have same problem with long distance render, it's not your save, just the game no love hard render after long loading 😦
Erodros#6037: there a way to disable auto saves in game?
Erodros#6037: it saved 3 times during loading? humm mabye?
Erodros#6037: oh wait! the save loaded..it took 15 min and the game crashed right after though:P
Erodros#6037: ``` <[newline]> 2022-01-15T20:53:17Z | INFO  | [Game network] Connected to server <[newline]> 2022-01-15T20:53:17Z | INFO  | [Scene Loader] Loading world type MHG.Gridlands <[newline]> ```
Erodros#6037: Seems to die right after
CrispyPin#1149: ~~just use integer coordinates and scale everything up by 12~~
Erodros#6037: server didn't seem to know that though
Erodros#6037: bleh yea save is corrpted, won't load on single player
Jimmy#8080: I don't anticipate that being necessary, but if it turns out to be I will indeed do that.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i still feel like .3 will have to be changed to .25 or something
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <:heartpeepo:872133473312325732>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <:Thanks:820484955574370315>
Jimmy#8080: Fixed precision
Erodros#6037: thing is the server dosn't say anything is wrong so I am wondering if its something on the client end, ido:P
Erodros#6037: ip6 and ip4 works too, I wish there was some way to validate a save
Erodros#6037: humm, its only 10 meg though
Erodros#6037: just moving the data.logicworld out and having it rebuild a new save did it
Erodros#6037: clean save easy login
Erodros#6037: welp it was the save
Erodros#6037: humm
GHXX#9078: when i set up a server simply using ipv4 fixed it, as my isp doesnt support ipv6 (but my lan still does), but if your isp supports ipv6 then it shouldnt be an issue
Erodros#6037: <@109262887310065664> Well thats the thing, ip6 does work from inside and outside my network on other things.  Even then I disabled it on the linux server so it wasn't using the duel stack.  This also happens on the local lan as well.  Going ot try a new save file to see if that fixed it
Dragon Lord#6944: How are you planning on fixing it? Are you planning on switching to fixed precision numbers for positions within a sub assembly, using a local coordinate system, or...?
GHXX#9078: looks like backproblems to me 😅
Saltypretzel#0321: Lmao this looks like a bent spine
Jimmy#8080: This is a known issue and will be fixed.
Jimmy#8080: That does indeed look pretty cool
GHXX#9078: now we can make cool overhang structures
GHXX#9078: 😂
Ryan#9918: 
Ryan#9918: 
Ryan#9918: things shift the more its copied.
Ryan#9918: My friend encountered what seems to be a floating point issue
GHXX#9078: <@!159097563209924617>
GHXX#9078: likely not a game issue, but likely hte issue is that many ISPs dont even support ipv6 yet, which is pretty stupid, so those people cannot connect via ipv6
Erodros#6037: somone yelled at me "server is down" and just looked at it so havn't diagnosted it more than this heh
Erodros#6037: have others loggin on too and same issue on their side, I will look more on it latter
Erodros#6037: Not sure that was it, I disabled ip6 in linux, and restarted
circuitgamer77#0377: Well known kind of bug, but I don't remember the exact problem.  I think the game needs IPv4, but someone else should verify that.
Erodros#6037: Indeed, only message I get.  I am thinking it might be the save now as we had an issue where the save was corrpted and had to go back a few hours
Erodros#6037: ```something fucky is afoot```
Erodros#6037: is all I am getting, not sure there is any comuncation going? humm

Erodros#6037: hah
Erodros#6037: especialy like running a server, then trying to connect local host and using a nat for other people?
Erodros#6037: Anyone having problems with ip6 on this game?
Ecconia#4929: And I did create a tracker issue for this months ago. "works as intended" or so would be the result of that.
Ecconia#4929: GitHub at least allows back-slash instead of multi space.
Jimmy#8080: As Goose said, it's so that you can make nice markdown source files in a text editor without line wrapping. I agree it's kinda meh
PseudoGoose#2841: so that's why a single newline isn't considered a line break or new paragraph, because so many plaintext files wrap their paragraphs across multiple lines and then use two newlines between paragraphs*. <[newline]> Though I agree that the "two spaces at the end of the line" is not a good syntax, though it is the only way that I know of to make a line break without adding vertical space between lines.
PseudoGoose#2841: including plaintext
PseudoGoose#2841: because it is common etiquette to wrap your lines at 80 or 100 chars
ThePiGuy24#0369: and its not just a blanket ignoring newline, you can still use it as part of the syntax, just not for layout
ThePiGuy24#0369: like i can think of zero reason why ignoring newline and having to use multiple spaces would be preferred
ThePiGuy24#0369: well, not the one thing, but the biggest thing
ThePiGuy24#0369: the one thing about markdown that irritates me greatly
HuntaBadday#3556: Ah, ok
Ecconia#4929: <@!625413443541008434>
Ecconia#4929: That's markdown being annoying. <[newline]> Just put like 3 or more spaces at the end of the lines.
HuntaBadday#3556: <@!154964593397989376> Website being weird with text

circuitgamer77#0377: A workaround is to just pause and unpause after sending the new tickrate command - when I did it it seemed to interpret the command after unpausing.
almafa64#1396: if the tick rate set to 0 you cant change it
Jezza#1264: No idea.
Jezza#1264: Or maybe I just forgot to try that.
Jezza#1264: But yesterday, it didn't.
Jezza#1264: But cloning it worked, for some reason.
Jezza#1264: Moving it, rotating it, etc, nothing
Ecconia#4929: Try to move it by one square unit and then resize. Sometimes that works. Might also try to rotate it, if that also does not work. <[newline]> But I did report that before. Super damn annoying. And happens way too often.
circuitgamer77#0377: That's a known bug, but I don't know if there's a workaround...  Someone else can probably answer that.
Jezza#1264: It seems that ShareX's default capture FPS isn't high, but it shows the problem.
Jezza#1264: 
Jezza#1264: I can't seem to resize a circuit.
circuitgamer77#0377: I always get confused when F doesn't work for me, before I remember that I rebound it to Delete...

Limón#7879: sad
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: im not sure, but i think it may be
White Laurent#5414: so it's intended, I see
White Laurent#5414: oh, so there is a distance they have to have inbetween them?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: theyre TP waypoints
White Laurent#5414: doesn't happen often, more like randomly. apologize my ugly try, the red wasn't done yet. you see the first two flags being more on the left, while the other 4 or 5 are way more right. the 2 bigger flags always changed the position when I resized the smaller flags
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i dont think they can overlap
White Laurent#5414: so I tried reproducing a lgbt flag and I noticed that if you edit one flag, all the other flags slightly change their position
circuitgamer77#0377: Other issue - at low tickrates (possibly only when lagging) my camera jitters slightly.
circuitgamer77#0377: I have a lot of things in my hotbar, but they all just went poof for a bit...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hmmm
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: fast buffer
Spider EveryOS#8098: I noticed that <[newline]> When you first launch the game, deleting worlds works correctly <[newline]> But if you enter a world and then exit the world <[newline]> Deleting a world when then show up as having been deleted, but won't actually delete the world <[newline]> (either that, or my computer is borked)
circuitgamer77#0377: Reloading fixed it - that was weird.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll reload and see if it's fixed...
circuitgamer77#0377: Screenshots don't seem to show my hotbar - this is what it looks like to me (had to use Snipping Tool):
Biggycheese69420#4947: ok
circuitgamer77#0377: Not that
Biggycheese69420#4947: F1
circuitgamer77#0377: that's an unhelpful screenshot, one moment...
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know which keys I just accidently hit, but my hotbar seems to have died...
Limón#7879: is this tung?
beluga#6474: 
HomelikeBrick42#1173: too much stuff is being allocated so the garbage collector has to find stuff to get rid of
HomelikeBrick42#1173: thats probably the garbage collector
Saphire#0773: Strangely, after running the game for hours, the resizing become THE most FPS hitting thing in the game <[newline]>  <[newline]> I get stable nice fps, but then I touch resizing and everything hitches and sliws down a noticeable bit
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: A t flip flop can be made with just a d latch and inverter. Operates on 1 tick pulses.
Ryū Risto#0001: Yeah, had to use a pulse shortener and a D Latch to make a working T Flip Flop
GHXX#9078: try an implementation using a data latch :)
ThePiGuy24#0369: it is intended behaviour of the game, yes
Ryū Risto#0001: Are you sure this is how the circuit should behave after 1 tick pulse to either of the inputs?
Biggycheese69420#4947: in real life gate delay is random so it locks into one state usually
ThePiGuy24#0369: so you need 2 ticks of time to pass for both gates to settle to the new state
Biggycheese69420#4947: it's because the inverters have delay
ThePiGuy24#0369: they have a 1 tick delay
ThePiGuy24#0369: thats not a bug
Ryū Risto#0001: I need to keep the inputs pressed for a significant amount of time in some cases in order for this to not happen
Ryū Risto#0001: This is cursed
Ryū Risto#0001: For some reason my SR latches keep flashing rapidly when I change their state too quickly
HuntaBadday#3556: Circuit stops updating
Ecconia#4929: Only visibly (cause that may happen, just reload), or are they actually not updating the circuit anymore?
HuntaBadday#3556: I have an issue where some wires will get stuck on or stuck off, and to fix it I have to replace the wire
Ecconia#4929: Yeah I know, since this is probably some memory issue, it can happen at super many places
GHXX#9078: i recommend taking this stacktrace with a grain of salt since its suspiciously long
GHXX#9078: its weird, because the other error was just in some JIT code
Ecconia#4929: ofc its the collision... ||for the meme||
GHXX#9078: different error, but also in mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll, but it might be that the stack is messed up since it keeps listing those very bottom calls
Ecconia#4929: sure
GHXX#9078: ill attach VS and see if the stacktrace is similar
GHXX#9078: wanna send me your world?<@151293812675706880>
Ecconia#4929: Looool I can reproduceable shrink the RAM to like 200MB (once per operation), by just clicking the non-responsive window and causing the Windows "no response" dialog. What the actual hell? Is this real life here? <[newline]>  <[newline]> Why does LW not take up 100% of  one CPU core. But might just be task manager being broken. Or a significant work of LW is done on the GPU. Who knows. <[newline]>  <[newline]> This is not normal what the hell?? Major weird... <[newline]> Is this on Linux too? <[newline]>  <[newline]> Might be the collision though, which takes exponential time. The waiting time. Since I made sure to use 1x1 boards, that is lots of squared collision to handle... <[newline]>  <[newline]> Hmm now it crashed. I will try to load it once... <[newline]> Hmm tasty 12.3MB world... <[newline]> Yeah and it crashes somewhen, while I am AFK. So pretty reproduceable. Big worlds on Windows do not load.
Ecconia#4929: Loool, the game just froze and memory usage dropped from 2. GB down to 200MB... Dat garbage collection... <[newline]> A. The ram rises way too quickly (when editing). <[newline]> B. The garbage collection appears to take some time. <[newline]> -> The main thread is also occupied for way too long. Which might confuse users. <[newline]> HOLY, how is the RAM dropping to 170MB to then recover again? Is LW building up all models from scratch or what? <[newline]> It starts responding again, once it reached about 1GB Ram using. What the heck is going on? <[newline]>  <[newline]> Like literally: <[newline]> - Copy <[newline]> - Freeze <[newline]> - RAM rise to 2.0GB <[newline]> - Looooong wait time <[newline]> - Ram drop to 127MB????? (After windows no respond dialog) <[newline]> - Ram (slooooowly) rise to 1.0GB <[newline]> - Continue. <[newline]>  <[newline]> And it should definitely not take this long for a couple thousand boards with each layer full of delayers. What the hell... <[newline]>  <[newline]> So my assumption is: LW is heck nice memory optimized. <[newline]> However it discards objects like nobodies business. <[newline]> Or it reconstructs itself for whatever reasons during heavy operations...
Ecconia#4929: Oh noes, the bugs are so different on windows. I have like no keyboard bugs at all (with German keyboard layout)
Ecconia#4929: Normally it only breaks on iOS. Try another browser maybe? Which browser are you using there?
MS#5409: Even when requesting the desktop version
MS#5409: All i get is a black page
MS#5409: Hmm weird
GHXX#9078: yes
GHXX#9078: sec
MS#5409: <@109262887310065664> does the LogicWorld site work on phone for you?
GHXX#9078: 👌
MS#5409: I wasn't expecting that tbh
MS#5409: Ah
Ecconia#4929: Windows
MS#5409: Do you know if jimmy run linux or windows <[newline]> And in linux what distro
Ecconia#4929: Will try to reproduce later today.
GHXX#9078: <@151293812675706880> if you want, throw so much into the world that your client needs more than 4GB ram then save the world, restart, load it, and ideally it should crash if it still uses more than 4GB
GHXX#9078: its reproducable using this world by 3 different people, but it does work on linux (without proton)
Ecconia#4929: However if all worlds reliably break once teaching 4GB on windows that would be a severe bug. I wonder if any other windows user can confirm that. <[newline]> (With another world). <[newline]> Cause then it's rock solid reproduceable <[newline]> (and a reason for Jimmy fix quick)
GHXX#9078: technically we'd hope that it does crash, that way its reproducable
GHXX#9078: ok i updated the ticket accordingly
MS#5409: Lets hope it doesn't crash his session 😅
GHXX#9078: jimmy willl need to load the world in unity probs
GHXX#9078: yeah it seems the issue is within some mono jit code
MS#5409: <@109262887310065664> oh running the game with proton (steam version of 🍷) also crashes when loading tetris
MS#5409: Visual studio debugger is/was hooked on after the game was launched
MS#5409: Yes Nvidia 2070 RTX (laptop)
GHXX#9078: <@!327048348303622145> are you using an NVIDIA gpu on your client machine?
HuntaBadday#3556: And it takes a lot of time to start working again
HuntaBadday#3556: My game broke after trying to move something large
GHXX#9078: https://logicworld.net/tracker/284 <@!211188784803348482><@!327048348303622145>
GHXX#9078: no, thats vs attached, it also crashes without when loading <@!211188784803348482> 's tetris world
Ecconia#4929: Heavily looks like you tinkered with LW for that to happen. <[newline]> (Like if you are running it with another program - like this looks like - then that program might add a hard cut to the memory usage).
GHXX#9078: LW client seems to crash when using more than 4 gigs of memory on windows
Siggy#1321: the logs closest to the times of the crashes are empty unfortunately, and the ones that aren't don't seem to mention anything about errors. are there any settings i can change in the game to enable more detailed logging?
Ecconia#4929: Lol, that is however an issue of your Window Manager... <[newline]> No matter what a program does, this should not happen... Given its a crash. <[newline]> I assume the game also crashes in that process? That is more of a problem. What does the game log contain?
Siggy#1321: i was able to recreate the issue and record it after posting my original message, but after that i couldn't get it to happen again. in total, the bug occurred 3 or 4 times, and one other time the save color button broke the UI by squishing all text and buttons together
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Now the world crash before opening
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Nope, still buggy
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Tabs were also a problem

BigMintyMitch#1620: Am I missing something?

commander of the pandas#1576: it seems like drums only play a sound when the wire renders on, (so if you have your simulation rate really high and send short pulses most of the time the wire wont **render** on and therefore the drum won't play.
Limón#7879: when the devs aspire to be factorio devs
circuitgamer77#0377: I guessed it was known - it seems like the kind of thing that just sort of exists from early in development, but isn't high enough priority to get fixed.
Ecconia#4929: It happens whenever you click something else besides a peg. Super annoying and ofc bugged. And reported already 🙂
Ecconia#4929: There ya go: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/233>
DanielGJ44#4557: At least it's not game breaking
DanielGJ44#4557: But yeah that is certainly a main annoyance for me lol
circuitgamer77#0377: I figured :)
DanielGJ44#4557: That's also been around since beta... But I think it wasn't fixed because a big rewrite of multiplace is coming
circuitgamer77#0377: Occasionally if I'm multiplacing wires and I do something to stop the multiplacement, all of the pegs that were selected keep their blue outline but they are all deselected.  They stay blue until I multiselect them again.  Almost certainly well known, I just haven't seen it mentioned in this channel.  Super minor and not a big problem :)
DanielGJ44#4557: Certified logic world classic
Daimh#5870: Well its back if it was fixed at some point <:7ACOSP_lmao:755810746310459432>
DanielGJ44#4557: And yeah my solution was generally reloading but that was before undo existed
DanielGJ44#4557: I seem to recall encountering that issue in beta so I'm pretty sure it is or was known at some point
Daimh#5870: This isnt a screenshot of a bug but a similar example. For me its like you do the thing where you drag both together, but it doesn't click and you end up with this. The wires all have the dark blue outlines on them and the pegs will connect to each other as well. Undoing (ctrl Z) fixes the entire problem
GHXX#9078: idk if its a known issue
GHXX#9078: i think i know what you are talking about. You can move the board you are working on, so its no longer in the way. But its only fixable by reloading (or maybe reconnecting to) the world i think
Daimh#5870: I need to get a screenshot of this because it is hard to explain
Daimh#5870: Is it already a known bug that ctrl clicking to connect multiple wires, sometimes causes a ghost wire phenomenon where all wires appear to be connected to one of the points you connect it to?
ThePiGuy24#0369: ah
HomelikeBrick42#1173: if you are its a known bug https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901158328405729371/912398644307722241

[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: so a bug lol
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: i mean its not intended
ThePiGuy24#0369: not sure whether this is a bug or something else, sometimes when i attempt to place something, the hotbar scrolls and changes what i am trying to place, happens on both mouse down and mouse up
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: looks futuristic
Limón#7879: just a bit unsupported
ThePiGuy24#0369: my guess is that this is because it is running on an intel igpu from nearly a decade ago, so it might be *ever so slightly* unsupported

Ecconia#4929: As in "the game is loading" is already a greeting thingy. Any visual content. <[newline]> While "the game is loading" is an amazing animation of 0.0005fps 😄
Ecconia#4929: same thing
Verlio_H#0201: you use arch btw
QMechanic#7708: There's no such package name in Arch. I think I do have the same contents as that package in Debian though.
GHXX#9078: did you install mono-complete?
QMechanic#7708: Nothing is working for me. No idea what dependencies this program requires. It gives no errors that I can see.
GHXX#9078: so because of this you might want to install mono-complete
GHXX#9078: ~~you could also try installing the netcore sdk~~ seems that dotnet-runtime is netcore in arch
GHXX#9078: yeah usually c# would load it from the global assembly cache
GHXX#9078: you could try that then
QMechanic#7708: That specific line did change yes. But game still not starting. And I mean I can't really manually move all the files to where they should be. That should be automatic by the game.
QMechanic#7708: sure
GHXX#9078: and see if that line is gone
GHXX#9078: try putting the mscorlib dll so file into there then
QMechanic#7708: For testing.
QMechanic#7708: I put it there.
GHXX#9078: i wonder why this is in a temp folder
GHXX#9078: 
QMechanic#7708: I installed all of these packages and I believe that should be enough for C#/dotnet <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> sudo pacman -S dotnet-runtime dotnet-sdk mono-msbuild mono <[newline]> ```
QMechanic#7708: Arch Linux.
QMechanic#7708: I have already installed a lot of C# stuff. I do have that file at `/usr/lib/mono/4.5/mscorlib.dll.so`
GHXX#9078: what linux distro are you using?
QMechanic#7708: I do have `/tmp/Logic\ World\ v0.90.3\ -\ Linux/Logic_World_Data/Managed/mscorlib.dll` though.
GHXX#9078: SO suggets https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10490155/unable-to-run-net-app-with-mono-mscorlib-dll-not-found-version-mismatch for a missing mscorlib.dll (i realize that you are missing the mscorlib.dll.so)
GHXX#9078: aah
QMechanic#7708: I have no idea what to look for but checking with `strace`, I notice among other things: <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/Logic World v0.90.3 - Linux/Logic_World_Data/Managed/mscorlib.dll.so", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) <[newline]> openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/Logic World v0.90.3 - Linux/Logic_World_Data/Managed/mscorlib.dll.so.la", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) <[newline]> openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/Logic World v0.90.3 - Linux/Logic_World_Data/Managed/mono/aot-cache/amd64/mscorlib.dll.so", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) <[newline]> openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/Logic World v0.90.3 - Linux/Logic_World_Data/Managed/mono/aot-cache/amd64/mscorlib.dll.so.la", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) <[newline]> ```
GHXX#9078: however, both of those are also referenced by the LogicWorld.dll, meaning they should be loaded already, assuming the LogicWorld dll gets loaded first
GHXX#9078: since most are shipped with the game you should be able to find all of them except for <[newline]> mscorlib and System.Core
GHXX#9078: (assuming you are using the same dll on linux, which may not be the case)
GHXX#9078: so one of <[newline]> // Detected Target-Framework-Id: .NETFramework,Version=v4.0 <[newline]>  <[newline]> // Referenced assemblies (in metadata order): <[newline]> // LogicAPI, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null (unresolved) <[newline]> // LogicLog, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null (unresolved) <[newline]> // LogicWorld.Interfaces, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null <[newline]>     // Assembly reference loading information: <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List <[newline]>  <[newline]> // LogicWorld.SharedCode, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null <[newline]>     // Assembly reference loading information: <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List <[newline]>  <[newline]> // mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089 <[newline]>     // Assembly reference loading information: <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List <[newline]>  <[newline]> // System.Core, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089 <[newline]>     // Assembly reference loading information: <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]> // Assembly load log including transitive references: <[newline]> // mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089 <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List <[newline]>  <[newline]> // LogicWorld.Interfaces, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List <[newline]>  <[newline]> // LogicWorld.SharedCode, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List <[newline]>  <[newline]> // System.Core, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089 <[newline]>     // Info: Success - Found in Assembly List
GHXX#9078: because you are likely missing one of the dependencies of said dll
GHXX#9078: what you could try is  <[newline]> install mono <[newline]> install netcore
GHXX#9078: well, you probably waited for 20 seconds roughly
QMechanic#7708: I don't know which line. but I did close the game after waiting, yes.
GHXX#9078: actually i might take this back
GHXX#9078: you closed the game between when those two lines were written im assuming?
GHXX#9078: ```2021-12-15T19:16:32Z | TRACE | [ModLoader] Loading assembly ΩLogicWorld.Subassemblies, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null <[newline]> 2021-12-15T19:16:55Z | DEBUG | [ModLoader] Disposing mods```
QMechanic#7708: Yes I did, here's a log.
QMechanic#7708: I have 0.90.3.14
GHXX#9078: <@!347459163728642049> whats your game version btw? (0.90.3) is the latest on steam
GHXX#9078: mono shouldnt be needed anymore since logicworld uses netcore instead of .net framework
GHXX#9078: did you set the loglevel to trace btw?
QMechanic#7708: I just installed `mono` for C# but no luck yet.
QMechanic#7708: What dependencies does the Linux version have?
GHXX#9078: he doesnt see the greeting animations, only the "game is loading lol"
QMechanic#7708: I installed graphics drivers and nothing changed.
QMechanic#7708: Should this game be installed in some specific path on the system?
Ecconia#4929: The switch from 2D to 3D is a bunch of of shader and matrix swaps. That does not need additional drivers. <[newline]> If you already see the greeting animation and loading screens, you will most likely not have further issues.
GHXX#9078: you should def try what ecconia suggested tho
GHXX#9078: im not sure if an integrated cpu graphics card would be strong enough
QMechanic#7708: I'll be able to test the theories in a few hours though.
QMechanic#7708: Well I don't think it should be the GPU **load** per se. I believe it would only be very laggy but still work if that was the issue.
GHXX#9078: running logicworld on integrated cpu graphics probs would be terrible
GHXX#9078: so it likely very well can be a gpu load issue
GHXX#9078: okay, cuz thats literally when the gpu use jumps up
GHXX#9078: that, which comes right after "game is loading lol"
QMechanic#7708: Nope.
GHXX#9078: 
GHXX#9078: sec
QMechanic#7708: Sequence?
GHXX#9078: <@!347459163728642049> do you ever see the intro image sequence?
QMechanic#7708: I agree with Ecconia although maybe if it requires some drivers like OpenGL or what not.
GHXX#9078: this jump is when the image-sequence starts
GHXX#9078: thats on a gtx1080
GHXX#9078: 
GHXX#9078: graphics could be the issue imo since loading up to the main menu definitely needs more gpu resources than pure desktop use
Ecconia#4929: The network is still required to get to the main-menu, else it halts at that very position after the welcome screen. <[newline]> I am not sure what else breaks it.
Ecconia#4929: X11 alone is definitely not the issue. Cause I also run on that... (doesn't anything non-wayland, run on that? [linux]) <[newline]>  <[newline]> No since the graphics already work that is probably not an issue. <[newline]> You could add  `loglevel trace` to the file in the  `licc` folder. <[newline]> That prints more information. Not sure if anything relevant is there though.
Limón#7879: I know some unity games have problems with tiling window managers aswell
Limón#7879: that might be the problem
Limón#7879: ah
QMechanic#7708: X
QMechanic#7708: Xorg
Limón#7879: never heard of X11
QMechanic#7708: Anyways Alt + F4 is irrelevant. I know how to close the programs.
QMechanic#7708: That's it.
QMechanic#7708: I use X11 + i3.
Limón#7879: what about your DE
QMechanic#7708: Alt + F4 does nothing for me.
GHXX#9078: if your pc is falling back to using the integrated cpu gpu then that would be bad news 😅
QMechanic#7708: I use `i3` tiling window manager.
GHXX#9078: oh that could be it
QMechanic#7708: Ohh actually... I should check y graphics drivers since I'm on a new installation and haven't really touched that yet. I will try installing some drivers and see if it magically works. Thanks for the idea!
Limón#7879: I know KDE has it I think xfce also has it
Limón#7879: so some DE's don't have it
GHXX#9078: ah
Limón#7879: desktop environment
GHXX#9078: whats de?
GHXX#9078: what setup are you running, e.g. pc or laptop, and what gpu and cpu?
Limón#7879: it's programmed into DE
Limón#7879: it kills whatever window you are tabbed into
GHXX#9078: interesting, didnt know that. does it also close the currently focused window?
GHXX#9078: f2 is screenshot
GHXX#9078: aah
Limón#7879: alt+f4 also work on linux
QMechanic#7708: idk, I just pressed random buttons.
GHXX#9078: i dont know if f2 does something in-game tho
QMechanic#7708: I could close it gracefully though. I have reason to believe that only the screen get's stuck but not the actual game because I can press `F2` and hear sound effects from a camera.
GHXX#9078: booting up takes about 15 seconds for me till the mousehat games and logicworld logo sequence starts
QMechanic#7708: I had to quit it myself. It would be stuck for minutes until I closed it manually.
GHXX#9078: so, maybe just give it more time?
GHXX#9078: when it catches an alt+f4 (on windows), so presumable also a ctrl+c or sigint on linux, it shuts down gracefully
QMechanic#7708: Yeah very weird.
GHXX#9078: seems like there was no error
QMechanic#7708: Nothing more.
QMechanic#7708: That's it.
QMechanic#7708: ``` <[newline]> 2021-12-15T12:32:11Z | INFO  | [Lidgren network client] Initialized network client on port 57848 using protocol IPv6 <[newline]> 2021-12-15T12:32:11Z | INFO  | [Online manager] Setting status to Online -  <[newline]> 2021-12-15T12:32:40Z | INFO  | [Lidgren network client] Disconnecting from server: quitting game <[newline]> 2021-12-15T12:32:40Z | INFO  | [Online manager] Setting status to Offline -  <[newline]> ```
GHXX#9078: 
GHXX#9078: there should be a logs folder near the executable
GHXX#9078: 
GHXX#9078: check the log
GHXX#9078: actually!
QMechanic#7708: I downloaded it from itch.io and run the executable.
GHXX#9078: so you run the game in steam and it never gets to the main menu?
QMechanic#7708: I never see this. It was just the Intro Screen.
GHXX#9078: thats where im at rn
Limón#7879: I don't think clicking the single player button would be internet
GHXX#9078: <@!347459163728642049>
GHXX#9078: so about the start game button, where is that?
QMechanic#7708: I guess it's not internet then.
QMechanic#7708: Just checked with wireshark, it does seem to establish a connection to `logicworld.net` with packets going both directions (IPv4).
GHXX#9078: so its probably not that
GHXX#9078: im in the same situation. <[newline]> ipv4+6 in the lan and only v4 for the internet
QMechanic#7708: I do have IPv4. Maybe even IPv6 locally but that's blocked by my ISP.
GHXX#9078: in any case, do you have internet access (ipv4)?
QMechanic#7708: I think it might be just the image that is frozen because I hear sounds if I press `F2`
QMechanic#7708: I press the big blue button "start game" and then it's stuck.
QMechanic#7708: It's after I get the Intro screen with "Welcome to logic world"
GHXX#9078: when does your issue happen? when loading up the game, before the main menu? or when loading a map?
QMechanic#7708: I tired to search for similar errors in this discord, apparently the game did require networking in an earlier version and would get stuck otherwise.
QMechanic#7708: I haven't changed any settings.
GHXX#9078: but since you just got the game im assuming you are playing Singleplayer
GHXX#9078: however. the game uses ipv6 for servers by default, so if you want to host a logicworld server then you want to change the ip-mode to v4 in the server config if any of the clients that want to be playing do not have access to ipv6
GHXX#9078: game does not need ipv6
QMechanic#7708: Logs didn't say any errors.
QMechanic#7708: I don't know what the issue is. But the game is stuck on that screen.
QMechanic#7708: I just bought the game, downloaded version 0.90.3-Linux and I'm stuck at "the game is loading lol"
QMechanic#7708: Does this game require IPv6 or something?
borges#7777: any news on that? I don't even know if it was previously known
borges#7777: still
borges#7777: I had a backup thankfully
borges#7777: lost another save to the bulk undo tomfoolery
commanderguy3001#6660: :cringe:
commanderguy3001#6660: yeah, one gotta be really tough to see that
Maxafrost#6981: if you want more misaligned components, here you go 🙃
commanderguy3001#6660: oh FUCK STACKING:
commanderguy3001#6660: aand my game just crashed
commanderguy3001#6660: eyy, <@!154964593397989376> I _think_ I found a reliable way to reproduce misaligned components
commanderguy3001#6660: aand theory has been proven to be wrong
commanderguy3001#6660: took just under 700 seconds this time: 693.0 seconds to be precise
commanderguy3001#6660: aand there we go
commanderguy3001#6660: 3 minutes to go
commanderguy3001#6660: cause i got one weird theory
commanderguy3001#6660: till i can even test if my theory is correct
commanderguy3001#6660: aand another 11.4 minutes to wait now
commanderguy3001#6660: well the thing is: the server is loading slow AF (11 minutes 26 seconds time for the world to load)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: all the modded components I use have like 64+ pins
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: oh yeah that will totally fuck me
commanderguy3001#6660: (custom component with 55 inputs and 32 outputs)
commanderguy3001#6660: cause if then it is a massive bug which leads to components taking forever to load
commanderguy3001#6660: <@!154964593397989376> I have a question about custom components in mods: <[newline]> on loading of the world, do you somehow loop through every combination of all inputs/outputs of a custom component to check that there's no overlapping/similar?
Ecconia#4929: What does the server log say, if the server crashed?
borges#7777: I'm really afraid of using undo after all that...
borges#7777: here
borges#7777: is that relevant? cause i dont want to waste yall time
borges#7777: so while trying to reproduce the wires-going-thru-stuff bug I managed to get completely locked out of a [testing] save
borges#7777: it actually bugs your save altogether
borges#7777: nevermind
borges#7777: then you come back and you get wires going thru the board, and you can't resize it back, you have to delete or move everything affected
borges#7777: you delete some stuff, then resize, then undo the bulk delete, then the wires are placed inside the board and you get the first crash
circuitgamer77#0377: It's not as familiar to me.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think it's known, but I'm not sure.
borges#7777: youre stuck with a board with stuff going thru it and you can't get rid of it cause that causes a crash
borges#7777: is this also known?
borges#7777: causes this
borges#7777: I found a way to recreate some other board-resizing related crash I think
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: cant recreate it for some reason
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: i had basically this ( you can slide in the middle if you are crouching)and the far side had extra room so i resized all three at once to remove the space
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: recreate
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: let me get an image of what i was doing
Ecconia#4929: Did you multi select resize boards? Cause then this happens.
circuitgamer77#0377: Floating point error, known bug :)  Confirmed fix in 0.91 :)
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: it is attached to the board even though it doesnt look like it, it moves along with it
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: if i try to resize this board it gives me oh no, also the board shouldnt even be possible to create so ya, no clue how i made it
circuitgamer77#0377: It's known :)
borges#7777: got this after undoing a couple board resizes, is this known? (currently trying to reproduce, but no luck)
circuitgamer77#0377: Correlation, not causation.
circuitgamer77#0377: It's always the graphics driver on the bluescreen, so it's definitely graphics-related.  Logic World is probably overloading my GPU somehow...
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know for sure that it was Logic World, but recently my computer has been either freezing or bluescreening soon after I load the game.  The second time I load it it usually works, but I thought I should mention it, just in case.  The more likely thing is that my graphics card or drivers are bad in some way...
Dragon Lord#6944: pretty sure it's an issue for and gates: don't think that they recalculate collision when resizing
Ecconia#4929: And probably nobody created an issue for that yet - might also affect other components with variable peg count.
Limón#7879: pretty sure that's known
commanderguy3001#6660: that just works without any checks, but if you then try to move the component next to it away and back again it does the check for the moved component
commanderguy3001#6660: if you take an and gate, place it down next to any component, then change the input count to 3, so it gets bigger
Ecconia#4929: Check the game bug tracker *shrug* <[newline]> Most also end up in this channel and never get reported.
commanderguy3001#6660: dunno if they're known already
commanderguy3001#6660: I have a couple more funny bugs
Limón#7879: <:ban:496748250372636693>
Limón#7879: BAN
Limón#7879: HAXER
commanderguy3001#6660: 
commanderguy3001#6660: oh well THIS is funny:
commander of the pandas#1576: You can also load a backup ~5 minutes before your last save in your backups folder
Ecconia#4929: Did you try with lowering the view/chunk range down to 30? <[newline]> (For some players that fixes things)
Artin_#3197: game crashes right after loading my save (i think my save is corrupt)
Ecconia#4929: Got reported in this issue: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/207> <[newline]> (If you want to add details)
Moldytzu#4226: a fix could be updating the text after each grabing of items from the hotbar
Moldytzu#4226: You can trigger this bug when you remove the currently selected item
Moldytzu#4226: and that is a switch
Moldytzu#4226: "Etichetă de panou" is panel label
Moldytzu#4226: found a bug
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: well ofc you can go farther with linux lol
Limón#7879: making literally everything forced to be comic sans
Limón#7879: I bet you can go farther with linux
Verlio_H#0201: look at time lmao
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: comic sans, active windows, search bar, the weather thingy
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: this is probably one of the most cursed windows screenshots you can have
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: why is your system font comic sans
commander of the pandas#1576: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: see if you have 2 instances of lw running
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ctrl + shft + esc
commander of the pandas#1576: can't start LW
commander of the pandas#1576: 
Ecconia#4929: Ahh, yes, this is how we handle deleted saves in GUI
CrispyPin#1149: but it really is unnecessary in most cases, like chubby sockets, inverters and pegs
CrispyPin#1149: diagonal and gates allow you to connect one input of all of them together easily
Limón#7879: I think
Limón#7879: yes
Sekoia#3968: also, has anybody ever actually used fine rotation in a way that *couldn't* be easily replaced by regular rotation?
Sekoia#3968: what distance are you at from the origin?
Limón#7879: floating point perfection
Ecconia#4929: Totally normal Pile'o boards.
drawcoco#9558: <:bobby_ok:692790276623958087>
Biggycheese69420#4947: known
drawcoco#9558: new one? or already known?
circuitgamer77#0377: You're welcome :)
RIVAL | Quent#0001: That did it! Thanks!
circuitgamer77#0377: Lowering the render distance has fixed it for several people..
RIVAL | Quent#0001: ooo will try that out
circuitgamer77#0377: Try setting the render distance to 30 before joining - this is a well known issue :)
RIVAL | Quent#0001: My brother is in the server right now, I just can't rejoin after leaving for a second, so it's something in the loading sequence of the map
RIVAL | Quent#0001: Is it common to build too much in a MP world and crash when you join? Seems like older saves are all good, but once I go in and start building more, eventually it gets to a point where I can't join anymore and my game crashes
circuitgamer77#0377: The hard part is fine rotations - boards and components don't always align with the grid.
EagleWolf404#5555: Yes, so global integer+ local offset + those three or four? fine positions. I don't know how to code however so.... good luck someone?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think there are three or four positions where you can fine place boards
Ecconia#4929: If you remove grasslands, then yes. <[newline]> Or you hack together a global offset and everything after that is integer. <[newline]> However this heavily limits the capabilities of future decisions of this game. <[newline]> Also I am not sure if Unity supports that wholeheartly.
Sekoia#3968: however they are 1x1x0.5, so maybe? I don't think you could go down under 0.5 with the current setup, so you could just say that each grid cell is actually 2, and make the boards 2x2x1
Sekoia#3968: the boards are rotatable, so yes, actually
EagleWolf404#5555: Would it be possible to have boards at whole integers to solve the rounding error? On grid world you cannot place them at weird positions and angles anyways. Right?
WhyNot?#2534: forgot to reply, whoops
WhyNot?#2534: i have it disabled on my server no problem, its the only pc on the network basically
Ecconia#4929: ~~I am not sure what the hasDiscovery is even good for. <[newline]> (Either you send it, or you don't.)~~
Ecconia#4929: lol, you can btw apply a backup to be able to join again.
RIVAL | Quent#0001: Still crashing just after joining the server though :/
RIVAL | Quent#0001: So the main menu issue is because I changed a setting: "EnableDiscovery". Seems like setting this to false isn't supported, and will crash your server list when your client attempts to ping the server to get info.
RIVAL | Quent#0001: I took a couple hour break from a MP server (self hosted on my PC), and now when I go to my server list it kicks me to the main menu with "Oh No! Value cannot be null. Parameter name: v1". If I edit my SavedServers.succ file to remove my local server from the list it doesn't kick me back to the main menu anymore, but when I go to log into the server, I log in, load the world, then immediately get kicked
commander of the pandas#1576: honestly I think im going to hold off on my big project until this bug is fixed because I want everything to line up correctly
circuitgamer77#0377: I know this is a very well known issue, I'm just posting more cases of it happening because I think they're interesting.
circuitgamer77#0377: And again...

Ecconia#4929: I am so glade at least that works! <[newline]> <@!154964593397989376> we have another case of Single Player not working. <@!174602903305191424> has the issue. <[newline]> But at least MP works.
N_58#8502: but at least I can test game on lan server for some time
N_58#8502: yep
WhyNot?#2534: thats weird indeed
N_58#8502: I just tried `localhost:43531` and It works! I can play. But that's still weird that I can't create singleplayer game :/
N_58#8502: oh wow
N_58#8502: btw, earlier, I tried hosting server. I tried to connect to `127.0.0.1:43531` (probably default port). And I had error `Can't connect to an IPv4 address when using IPv6 with Dual-Stack disabled`. Then I tried any other ip to just check if I wrote correct localhost ip but still I had the same error. So I probably used wrong IP. Idk what localhost ip use actually...
drawcoco#9558: oh ok perfect 🙂 <[newline]> gl for the fix, that s quite a big problem
commander of the pandas#1576: yes this is a bug everyone is dealing with called "floating point error" it's what happens when you make too many circuit boards relative to other circuit boards positions (placing a circuit board on a circuit board) and this is due to the computer rounding the position incorrectly. For now try to build your circuit boards so they only have a few links to the ground. This should be fixed in a later update.
drawcoco#9558: apparently I can't place this socket here... the circuit board is a micromillimeter not aligned <:thonking:432741465844875264>  <[newline]> crashed because I tried forcing it by changing the circuit board size
drawcoco#9558: yeayyhhh 🙂
N_58#8502: Yep, I just changed language to english and still didn't work
Ecconia#4929: Maybe this helps: <https://logicworld.net/view/pst-44f2a22f/server-hosting-tutorial>
N_58#8502: Is there any short tutorial explaining how to run server in this game? Or I just have to run Server.exe?
Ecconia#4929: Have you tried setting up a server and connecting to that? <[newline]> I set my system language to Polish, without any issues *shrug* So maybe that is not it.
N_58#8502: So what should I do? Wait for fix or what?
N_58#8502: I'm kinda sad. Can't play it since beginning :/
N_58#8502: I mean, I talk with you through the same internet that I use for playing games 😆 I have no idea what I can do
Sekoia#3968: the issue is that if it's larger, then you have to push it way further back, because otherwise you have intersections with wires
Sekoia#3968: makes it easily infinitely expandable
Sekoia#3968: *technically* no, but if you do you make your job much easier
101#1688: I haven't built a display yet, but when I do I certainly won't be doing it the way everyone here seems to be doing it!
101#1688: There's no reason for the circuitry on the back to be the same size as the pixels.
Sekoia#3968: if everything takes a 2x2 cube, good luck making a large display driver
Sekoia#3968: not really?
101#1688: Nah, density is irrelevant in this game
Sekoia#3968: dang, yeah I guess
Ecconia#4929: Look at this denseness of them, I want them back 😭 <[newline]> They have all the advantages...
Ecconia#4929: "small"... Not compared to the original 1-tick diode which got removed before EA. <[newline]> https://youtu.be/rFW34K0lZmc?t=41
Sekoia#3968: <@!151293812675706880> wait what's your nick about, the buffer is a small 1 tick diode
Ecconia#4929: Nice found a stack overflow in the client <https://logicworld.net/tracker/279>. <[newline]> When you turn on the super secret setting `AutoEnterNoclipOnStartFlying` the noclip can no longer be changed... You are bound to fall through the world. <[newline]> Oh and the game freezes every other time I join a world. Its NIZE. Especially cause this setting should be ON by default. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Fixed the bug myself. Fixed DLL in the thread below.
Sekoia#3968: but computers don't like confusing so using non-ascii chars is even more confusing
HomelikeBrick42#1173: especially stuff that uses multiple languages
Sekoia#3968: yeah
HomelikeBrick42#1173: language is confusing in general
Sekoia#3968: anything to do with non-ascii chars is so confusing lmao
Sekoia#3968: UTF-8 is hell
Ecconia#4929: -> <https://logicworld.net/tracker/271>
Ecconia#4929: Just for sanity, you do have an internet connection, while using the game? <[newline]> Your log only says something about some pointer error in the network code. Sadly that is not very helpful. <[newline]> If it was some other bug, I would suggest to try to connect to the local server, (the dedicated server delivered as steam tool). Maybe only SinglePlayer is broken. <[newline]> If you have a game-breaking bug, I am sure that the developer will investigate it even in his vacation.
N_58#8502: I am unlucky or sth... I downloaded it, it doesn't support x64 programs and it's probably the reason why I don't have Locale Emulator in context menu
Biggycheese69420#4947: same
WhyNot?#2534: this looks as intended to me
Biggycheese69420#4947: 
WhyNot?#2534: seems fine to me
Biggycheese69420#4947: 
Biggycheese69420#4947: 
Biggycheese69420#4947: yes
_UwU_#5967: pain, agony even
Biggycheese69420#4947: indeed
Limón#7879: you took the words right out of my mouth
Biggycheese69420#4947: 
Stenodyon#8192: You could try running it in an english locale using <https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/>, a few people here had success running the game with it before their system language got fixed
N_58#8502: I'm going out, if anyone wants some feedback/logs/whatever or just helo me with it then ping me
N_58#8502: nah, I uninstalled it with steam and then deleted rest of the files and it still doesn't work :/
WhyNot?#2534: well, that error is something i dont know what to do with XD, havent seen that one before
N_58#8502: sth in .NET
N_58#8502: there is even one error in polish
N_58#8502: 
WhyNot?#2534: it should prob be posted here so everyone can see it
N_58#8502: or just here
N_58#8502: you want it in private?
N_58#8502: that's actually interesting
N_58#8502: XD
Verlio_H#0201: system languages are jimmys worst nightmare
Stenodyon#8192: Thanks! The game files should be in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Logic World\`
N_58#8502: polish
Stenodyon#8192: ah! what is your system language ?
WhyNot?#2534: (to my knowledge)
N_58#8502: Yeah, I have other language than english. That would be kinda weird bug... Many people may have it in other language
WhyNot?#2534: all game files will be in the steam folder you installed it to
WhyNot?#2534: before you delete it all, can you post your logs?
circuitgamer77#0377: A vacation he absolutely deserves - he's put so much effort and time into making this amazing game :)
Stenodyon#8192: it's probably a long shot but is your system in another language than english ? there have been crashes related to system locale but I thought they were all fixed
N_58#8502: tell me where are all possible game files. Like %appdata%, documents or whatever. I will deleted everything and install one more time
Stenodyon#8192: unfortunately the dev is currently on vacation so he can't investigate it right now :/
Stenodyon#8192: ah crap I thought all the new world crashes were fixed
circuitgamer77#0377: That's why it didn't have a listed release date for so long - he was working hard to make it work as well as possible.
Biggycheese69420#4947: it was delayed like 3 times but okay
N_58#8502: because it's better not to give any release date than delay it more times than cyberpunk lol
WhyNot?#2534: Neither will you insulting the dev help ;)
circuitgamer77#0377: If anything, the fact that the game was delayed so much shows just how much the dev cares about making a good game.  I've run into very few bugs so far
N_58#8502: your "I had no issue" still won't help me
WhyNot?#2534: And I’ve had no issues with it other than my bugs in the mods I’m making which can’t be blamed on the dev
Biggycheese69420#4947: and i have 170 hr
Biggycheese69420#4947: I've had no issues with a game so far other than minor building bugs
N_58#8502: what could I expect from dev that delayed his game like 10 times xd
N_58#8502: and it doesn't work
N_58#8502: I already made 2 worlds, then reinstalled, made one more world
Biggycheese69420#4947: sometimes you have to reinstall the game it's a rare issue
N_58#8502: if it doesn't work, I will just refund
N_58#8502: I will wait some time, I will check it out tomorrow
Biggycheese69420#4947: make a new world
N_58#8502: it doesn't
Biggycheese69420#4947: try again it might work
N_58#8502: I just bought the game and can't play now because server doesn't work...?
Biggycheese69420#4947: the game runs on internal server even on single player something went wrong with it
N_58#8502: 
N_58#8502: Why the game disconnects from some server while loading singleplayer game?
circuitgamer77#0377: It's any program, not just Spotify for me.
circuitgamer77#0377: I've had that happen with a few different GPU-heavy programs...  I don't know what causes it (or even if it's the same thing that you got), but for me I'm suspecting Windows had an update that has trouble with my graphics drivers.  This has happened to me 3 times, all immediately followed by a bluescreen and restart (error code video tdr failure).
WhyNot?#2534: for non spotify users, thats not spotify is supposed to look like XD
WhyNot?#2534: uhhhhhh, i tried to launch the game and spotify did this and discord froze up and need to be force killed
Biggycheese69420#4947: same
Ecconia#4929: You see a red boarder when resizing? <[newline]> DEATH-FLAG any other key than ESC will crash you. (At least me - consistently)
Ecconia#4929: Indeed, did not think of that. But yeah its weird/unexpected. <[newline]> Cause on the square surface, it also attaches to the edge.
CrispyPin#1149: but yeah its inconvenient
CrispyPin#1149: the offset works out if you have another board between them
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> is it intentional, that these guys do not align with the edge of a board, when placed on the side of it? That makes side-placement like pretty much useless, in my judgement. While there is so many good usecases for it. <[newline]> I assume this is not intended?
Limón#7879: you're in a super position
101#1688: Out of interest, how many components are there in your world?
bollkalle#4092: Maybe this has been said before, but: It sometimes feels weird jumping near the objects you've created. I feel like it should feel smooth and you should either be on top of the object (for example a switch), or on the ground, but at times you kind of wobble between the two states. Have anyone else experienced this?
circuitgamer77#0377: Including loading time
circuitgamer77#0377: There are major improvements in progress for the next update.
commander of the pandas#1576: did get my world to load- but in my past experience once I turn it off and join again I get the problem again
commander of the pandas#1576: still think the load times and the amount of components in one world before your game crashes should be improved
circuitgamer77#0377: The render distance thing worked for me, but it sounds like a few people tried that and it didn't work, so not sure how effective it is.
zplilpz#9574: try creating a new world, exit to main menu, then load your world. has worked for me a few times for same problem
commander of the pandas#1576: symptom? my world loads and instantly crashes
commander of the pandas#1576: ooh I haven't tried turning my render distance down
circuitgamer77#0377: or workaround
circuitgamer77#0377: What's the symptom?  Maybe there's a known fix...
commander of the pandas#1576: well I don't know what to do with my world. I can go back a few backups to get it working again but that means that I'd lose my  progress... it seems as if I have hit the limit of components in one world. I either have to restart my build and try and build it with the least amount of components as possible or wait until the game can handle more components. Well I don't know if that is something that is possible to fix
Verlio_H#0201: jimmy should leave it in
101#1688: Looks like a feature to me!
Broyojo#2667: bobby cannon
HomelikeBrick42#1173: we have done more testing and if you crouch on the edge of the persons head you dont have to jump and you get flung alot faster
HomelikeSquid65#8653: dont stand on someones head and jump while they are teleporting...
circuitgamer77#0377: It does not fix it for me - I've had that work once, but not anytime recently.
Ecconia#4929: You can also move the board by one square and that mostly already fixes it. I did not observer this behavior on a board without child components yet though.
circuitgamer77#0377: Just that one peg.
circuitgamer77#0377: hmm...
circuitgamer77#0377: It's the unconnected peg here, so it's not the wire...
circuitgamer77#0377: More data on the boards not being resizable and not showing arrows - when I added back one peg I was not able to resize again.  I don't think there's anything special about that peg...
Sekoia#3968: if you move a large amount of things, it sometimes duplicates them
Theix#5229: Thanks, that seems to have worked, now it's just a matter of waiting for the save to load again
WhyNot?#2534: you should have a backup of the save in the backups folder
Theix#5229: I think I broke my save, did some ctrl+z's in a row and it crashed. I don't know if anyone else has gotten this, but now I get this everytime I try to load the save. Also does anyone know a fix for this?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: i guess more of a mod idea tho
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: i would like a no collision mode so i could atleast get around that
Sekoia#3968: floating point issues.. fun
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: i cant place this?? there is nothing to interfere
circuitgamer77#0377: I've tried to find a way to reproduce it, but I have not been able to figure it out...
Ecconia#4929: ^ If you have more info, or a very simple reproduction step: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/245>
circuitgamer77#0377: This still exists...  Resize not allowed despite being completely open.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: only that specific board too... how weird
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: 
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: this happens when i try to resize, it shows up and doesnt work then the game crashes
Sekoia#3968: nah it's just an advanced wind simulation
Verlio_H#0201: this video froze my computer lmao
Ecconia#4929: "Straight pile" (am rotating it)
Ecconia#4929: When you get kicked the 10th time in a row due to resizing... SUFFERING! <[newline]> +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1
CrispyPin#1149: <:NotLikeThis:668905220834590731>
Ecconia#4929: Talking about bugs, this one is like the most annoying to me.
Bumpy#3920: ah, completely forgot about the tracker. mybad
Ecconia#4929: ^ <https://logicworld.net/tracker/119>
Bumpy#3920: Sounds kinda break if played too quickly
WhyNot?#2534: Not sure what type of error this is but any attempt of moving my smaller adder on the left causes my client to lock up and i have to alt f4. the server still accepts the move though so its where i want it after a quick restart on my end
CrispyPin#1149: well apparenly not
Limón#7879: I am guessing gpu
Limón#7879: and graphics card or cpu?
DADp#7461: its always their problem somehow
CrispyPin#1149: but i dont have nvidia
DADp#7461: blame nividia
CrispyPin#1149: since other unity games work fine lmao
CrispyPin#1149: ima blame the LWRP (logic world render pipeline)
DADp#7461: also nividia drivers <:bobby_in_love:698430534187089920>
DADp#7461: imma guess every graphical bug is just linux being linux
CrispyPin#1149: ah lol
Ecconia#4929: Just that I do not have AMD... (nvidia GPU + Linux) <[newline]> And also have that bug
CrispyPin#1149: amd linux bug i think
Keklord#1759: Crashes on load if I don't take these precautions
Keklord#1759: My world is getting to be about 5.5 MB
Keklord#1759: This worked too
commander of the pandas#1576: Works fine for me
commander of the pandas#1576: What system are you on?
Daimh#5870: High contrast crosshairs dont work
commander of the pandas#1576: known bug, got it
HomelikeBrick42#1173: <@!211188784803348482>
commander of the pandas#1576: this is actually a useful feature but what?
commander of the pandas#1576: huh?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: reducing draw distance to minimum before joining works too
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thats weird as heck, good to know the work around :D
Keklord#1759: the game was crashing when I tried to go straight in 4 times
Keklord#1759: ^I just joined a different world and then loaded the target world and this worked
Theix#5229: Mine has done this too, I'm not sure if it's a quick fix or just random luck, but it has worked perfectly for me when I've just entered an empty world first, and then entered the world that crashes the game
Keklord#1759: any ideas?
Keklord#1759: world size 4.33 MB
Keklord#1759: i move for like 2 seconds then the game crashes
Keklord#1759: My world loads
Ecconia#4929: lol how does thig bug not appear at all and then twice a day??
OopsieDoopsie#0412: LITERALLY floating
Theix#5229: Now that's what I call a floating point <:bobby_joy:692808284331049040>
OopsieDoopsie#0412: le classique bruh moment
DADp#7461: noclue but they use unity
DADp#7461: somewhere
DADp#7461: mentions them moving the world
DADp#7461: https://youtu.be/LbY0mBXKKT0
DADp#7461: space
DADp#7461: becuase yonow
DADp#7461: outerwilds acutally moves the world in their game
CrispyPin#1149: but alas, unity
CrispyPin#1149: if only the coords were ints
DADp#7461: this is when i think moving the world becomes more reasonable
circuitgamer77#0377: More floating point weirdness...
WK#3638: Yes
Ecconia#4929: This? <https://logicworld.net/tracker/235>
zplilpz#9574: perhaps more annoyance than bug, but when a label is near the edge of a board and the board is highlighted with the mouse the white board outline goes through the label. The visual result of this since the label is the same color as the outline is that some lettering has an odd white line through it. Maybe the highlight could use a drop-shadow or some such?
WK#3638: In the main menu screen  there is a visible blinking line between two ends (I think) of panorama
Ecconia#4929: Kind of crazy that so many people are writing stuff on Steam... Shouting at wall... Poor Jimmy has to deal with all them (answer questions and complains). While the cool kids hang around here... <[newline]> Ahh was not logged in, so now it shows me what I already read.
CrispyPin#1149: aight
Ecconia#4929: Nope, add one 👍
Ecconia#4929: Might be the issue (might not be): <[newline]> Normally this happens when logic world spawns a browser or explorer instance and you have not closed that instance yet. Can you not press the "Stop" button in Steam? <[newline]> If not, close the browser and explorer instance which LW did spawn. <[newline]> [Happens to me on Linux]
CrispyPin#1149: is there already a bug report for this? I'm rotating after duplicating a set of components, before moving my cursor off the original components
CrispyPin#1149: rip
Darkhog#8724: Windows
CrispyPin#1149: what os?
CrispyPin#1149: steam moment
Darkhog#8724: Wanted to stream the game, but this issue prevents me from doing that as it's a serious nuisance.
Darkhog#8724: Can anyone else confirm this thing happens? https://steamcommunity.com/app/1054340/discussions/0/3194737075886361597/
101#1688: I've written containers that do this automatically before, it's very rarely useful, but sometimes it's exactly what you need
101#1688: Where N is the specific bit you are interested in
101#1688: (0x01 << N) & wordWithBits
101#1688: You can pack the bits into words using bitwise operations
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I've packed bits into bytes for flags on various algorithms.
Limón#7879: Or something like that
Limón#7879: Because they took too much memory calculating primes
Limón#7879: I made something like this for someone
CrispyPin#1149: long bool should be 4 bytes
Sekoia#3968: but yeah you can essentially pack 8 net states at a time into a byte, and compress memory usage a lot without increasing CPU usage *too* much (just a bit (heh), because you need to calculate which bit in a pack the state is in)
Limón#7879: Bools are always 1 byte
Sekoia#3968: nowadays even 8 bits is doubtful, the CPU often works with 64 bits at a time iirc
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Using biwise functions to change q single bit
CrispyPin#1149: `long bool`
Limón#7879: I am pretty sure it's always 8 bits
Limón#7879: How can you store 1 bit in memory
101#1688: Jimmy did tell me previously at one point that he planned to make the transmission of states more efficient, so there is doubtless room for improvement
101#1688: Indeed
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Still you wouldn't need to transmit them at all if there where no graphics for them and you weren't looking at them to request the state.
101#1688: Could in theory use some sort of Delta, where only changes are transmitted
101#1688: So they are sort of snapshots of what the simulation looked like at the moment of that frame. So I'd imagine the cost is pretty much just proportional to the size of your build.
101#1688: I think the wire states are transmitted at a fixed rate, I saw 60hz in a file somewhere I think?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: One thing that baffles me is how everything has graphics for logic states. If wires and connectors only showed its state when a player looks at it. The network traffic could be decimated as only graphics, sound and interactions need be transmitted. But I do like how cool the changing colors look.
101#1688: Avoiding polymorphism for implementing component behaviour would also speed it up.
101#1688: I thought about this a bit, you could pack net states at 1 bit to a net but you'd need indices into the netlist for inputs and outputs of gates, and some way to track which nets have updated in a given tick. Not sure how you could make it compact without having some dynamic allocation in there.
CrispyPin#1149: ~~jimmy only counts bytes sometimes~~
Ecconia#4929: (The only issue I would have is how to implement it in a way, that it takes very very very small amounts of memory - I do count bytes and objects... -> Each list is one list too much - but they are required)
Limón#7879: So exactly what <@377717131556552708> said
Limón#7879: But the unsafe method makes it make sure its not null
Limón#7879: If _PhasicLinks is null it dies
Limón#7879: ```cs <[newline]>         public void AddPhasicLinkWith(InputPeg otherInput) <[newline]>         { <[newline]>             if (!_PhasicLinks.Contains(otherInput)) <[newline]>             { <[newline]>                 AddPhasicLinkWithUnsafe(otherInput); <[newline]>             } <[newline]>         } <[newline]>  <[newline]>         public void AddPhasicLinkWithUnsafe(IInputPeg otherInput) <[newline]>         { <[newline]>             AddPhasicLinkWithUnsafe((InputPeg)otherInput); <[newline]>         } <[newline]>  <[newline]>         public void AddPhasicLinkWithUnsafe(InputPeg otherInput) <[newline]>         { <[newline]>             if (_PhasicLinks == null) <[newline]>             { <[newline]>                 _PhasicLinks = new List<InputPeg>(2); <[newline]>             } <[newline]>             if (otherInput._PhasicLinks == null) <[newline]>             { <[newline]>                 otherInput._PhasicLinks = new List<InputPeg>(2); <[newline]>             } <[newline]>             _PhasicLinks.Add(otherInput); <[newline]>             otherInput._PhasicLinks.Add(this); <[newline]>             Cluster.AddTwoWayLinkWith(otherInput.Cluster); <[newline]>         } <[newline]> ```
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: There's a safe function that calls up the unsafe function but it has a null exception. So technically the safe method is actually the unsafe method. No idea why Jimmy ended up calling them unsafe though.
Ecconia#4929: Like editing the existing clusters. Rebuilding them from scratch is easy again. However time expensive.
Limón#7879: Unsafe in this case means it doesn't check something which is considered unsafe, there is no memory unsafe code
Limón#7879: It will give you answers
Sekoia#3968: as a rust main "unsafe" sets off a lot of flags immediately
Limón#7879: I don't remember but if you look at the methods in the dll
101#1688: This, wouldn't be much of a simulation if you couldn't build circuits to simulate!
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Lol the code isbwonky
Limón#7879: So the unsafe method is actually safe
Sekoia#3968: what's that property?
Sekoia#3968: concern
Limón#7879: It doesn't check it has a certain property which crashes 99% of the time unless activated before hand
Ecconia#4929: The real enemy is editing the simulation clusters. Simulating it is easy.
Sekoia#3968: what does "WithUnsafe" mean in that?
Limón#7879: Phasic probably just uses similar code to how pegs connected work
Ecconia#4929: "It is easy, just write the simulation code..." I did that too 😄
CrispyPin#1149: ~~just read the source code~~
101#1688: Just read from the code sample above, I have no idea what the concept entails
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Jimmy said he'll release a paper on the logic simulation at some point. I'm particularly interested in how it's done.
Limón#7879: I have not seen phasic links anywhere
Ecconia#4929: Btw this is where I get my information from: https://logicworld.net/view/pst-f0c5341e/logic-world-wednesdays-the-zerotick-edition (And mostly from how I would implement it, knowing that there is an extra layer)
Limón#7879: There is secret links as well which I assume are 1 tick and not instant like phasic but idk
Limón#7879: Yeah it uses phasic links
101#1688: Anyway, based on <@151293812675706880>'s description, it looks like there is a whole phase in the tick process for handling them using this "phasic link" concept. So there probably aren't any bugs of the kind that I was speculating might be present
Limón#7879: You usually put an ! infront of an equal not after it if so
Limón#7879: At the end being after the =?
101#1688: I wanted to put an exclamation mark at the end and was worried it'd look dumb with two
CrispyPin#1149: ~~irrational hatred of advanced technology, got it~~
101#1688: Not sure, but I don't like them
Limón#7879: Is that suppose to be not equal to because my brain says /= is divide and set equal to
CrispyPin#1149: but are there any bugs with them?
101#1688: Simple != Bug free!
Limón#7879: With modding
Limón#7879: Easier than most of the stuff I wrote
Limón#7879: One way relay
101#1688: Yeah, there is a bunch of this in the memory on my CPU
Sekoia#3968: one thing I feel should be improved tho is the look of parts, they're all very generic rn
CrispyPin#1149: relay code is simple i promise
Sekoia#3968: relays take extra space
Ecconia#4929: Could one just use two AND gates to ensure both directions and connect one of each to one toggle-wire? <[newline]> (That loops or?)
Sekoia#3968: idk I think that right now it's quite balanced
Ecconia#4929: It it was that simple on the simulation level though 😛 "Just AND gates"
101#1688: Well, they'd be bidirectional, but yeah, pretty much
Sekoia#3968: 1 tick relays are just and gates tho
101#1688: Ahah! Vindication!
Ecconia#4929: And you will always get more performance if you do not use the instant-layer 😉
Ecconia#4929: But due to how the simulation works, there should be no room for non-deterministic choices. So we can be at ease. <[newline]> (Still this is a complicated algorithm, with lots of room for bugs).
Ecconia#4929: The evaluation of networks/clusters has been divided into two parts. The first updates the normal clusters - as before we had instant. !Important: we ignore instant input here! <[newline]> Now we need to figure out, if some instant-bridges have to turn off or on. We can easily detect that by checking if a cluster has an instant bridge connected to it, and if it just turned on/off. <[newline]> If a clusters state is depending on some other instant bridge input, we do not yet need to do anything. <[newline]> - Now we jump to the third state, we now know which clusters changed their state (ignoring instant bridged input to it). <[newline]> Tricky: So we have to basically recalculate how the instant ripples now. With a different set of real-source-clusters. <[newline]> I am not sure how I would implement that. But this is pretty much how LW does it.
101#1688: Almost certainly not important, I'm sure Jimmy is on top of it 🙃
101#1688: I think really my disdain for them is just based on how I _imagine_ them to maybe make the simulation less elegant 😆
101#1688: I'm not sure how relays and diodes could be worked into that without adding an additional stage
Ecconia#4929: Which is pretty much the case, yes.
101#1688: I had always imagined it to work a bit like systemc. Step 1, evaluate outputs of gates with input nets that changed, step 2 evaluate nets for which connected outputs have changed. Repeat
Stenodyon#8192: Since there is a hardcore inverter(-and-buffer?)-only mode planned, we could have a mediumcore no-instant-components mode. Doesn't seem like much but like you pointed out, that means no instant-carry adders :)
Ecconia#4929: Although my idea here is incomplete in the final steps, it should already get rid of your concerns.
Ecconia#4929: You are aware, that all the instant logic is done, after the non-instant logic gets processed? And even the steps in between are divided into different states. <[newline]>  <[newline]> So in theory (I do not know the current states of the simulation): <[newline]> - The state between simulation cycles is fixed. Let us define it by the current wire-states and what the components want to do next. <[newline]> Now we want to process a simulation cycle: <[newline]> - First step, each component takes its input and internal state, to change its output according to definition. <[newline]> After this step, all components are done with their tasks. Relays also have switched their state - but we did not yet update any wire. So components will behave consistently (including relays). <[newline]> - Second/Third step: This is the tricky part, at this point all relays are flipped, and diodes are just diodes. We need to calculate where all outputs can flow to - ignoring all previous states. And this is deterministic - to be discussed. <[newline]>  <[newline]> -> So the question is, with all the relays in place, with all the output-pegs having their "final" state, can we calculate the wire-states in a deterministic way for the next simulation cycle to be done?
101#1688: Still not convinced the instant components aren't quirky though.  Thankfully, they are optional 😉
101#1688: Indeedy
Stenodyon#8192: I think a big difference with redstone is Jimmy cares about the simulation not having strange quirks
101#1688: Yeah, thought so
Stenodyon#8192: Yeah this bug has been fixed
101#1688: Not sure if this is still the case though
101#1688: This was definitely the case right after release though, it took me only a couple minutes to break relays. I think all I did was wire two of them in series
101#1688: Indeed, there are a couple ways I can imagine getting around it, bit they're all a little hacky
Stenodyon#8192: whether or not a decision is made while updating relays depends on the implementation
Stenodyon#8192: I don't know how Jimmy implemented relays but so far I have not observed update order dependent behavior
Stenodyon#8192: Oh ok I thought you meant they *will* cause that kind of behavior, but what you meant is they *could* <[newline]> But if they do that's a bug and a bug that important usually gets fixed early
101#1688: Sten, care to weigh in?
101#1688: Or something to this effect
101#1688: Not true. If the net at either end of the relays are separate, the decision is "if this relay is active, set the state of the other net to the state of this net"
Ecconia#4929: But diodes are different... (in the way we must think about them)
Ecconia#4929: ^That applies as a solid state during the next simulation cycle.
CrispyPin#1149: there are no decisions being made during a tick tho, since relays take a tick to toggle they are equivalent to setting and removing a wire
101#1688: I guess you could fuse nets between ticks, like creating a wire, that might avoid the issue?
101#1688: More generally though, anything that involves making a decision about the state of a net _during_ a tick, could potentially introduce order dependent behaviour.
101#1688: I'm not convinced. I'll stick with and gates thank you very much 😉
Ecconia#4929: (luckily none, as long as there are no severe bugs)
Stenodyon#8192: What update order dependent behavior does the instant components introduce ?
101#1688: I just think it's a shame. There's a whole zoo of techniques for building fast carry chains, but because of relays, the only thing that makes sense is insta-carry
101#1688: I was always partial to parallel prefix adders
101#1688: Yeah, the big boy CLAs with blotters were what people used to do in TUNG
Ecconia#4929: The worst that could have happened with relays was the simulation performance suffering. My more horrible fear back then was that relays had been kind of instant because of some bug, on I think the falling edge. Which is indeed an absolute simulation-breaker. <[newline]> And ofc the adder issue, which indeed is a severe issue. But well if not for that we would have made big boi CLAs.
101#1688: Oh I see, I have had a couple booked gates, most commonly when I change the width of an and gate without disconnecting it
CrispyPin#1149: the inverter refused to turn off
101#1688: Just watched it, no idea what you were trying to demonstrate 🙃
CrispyPin#1149: its not the normal relay bug tho, see the video above it. After a massive step several components broke
101#1688: I thought Jimmy had fixed this in 90.1, but apparently not
101#1688: I know this is likely to be an unpopular opinion, but I think adding the instant components was a mistake. I actually stated as much in the dev log where Jimmy initially announced them. They kill adder design stone dead as instant carry becomes the only viable design, and they introduce intra-tick update order dependent behaviour just like we have to deal with in redstone. I think he should just make relays 1 tick and be done with it.
Limón#7879: minecraft past the border
DADp#7461: when resizing a board with child board it makes all componets have absolute value coords (if resizing on the negitive side (for some reason))
DADp#7461: or
DADp#7461: i dont see
DADp#7461: i see
DADp#7461: ah ok
DADp#7461: but directional 🤔
DADp#7461: looks like its resizing the main and that resizes the child, but the child gets resized
Ecconia#4929: Indeed! Best issue so far 😄 <[newline]> -> I wonder if this resize issue (resize not possible, cause arrows missing) is also caused by your issue. This is awful that child components do not get updated when you resize a board...
CrispyPin#1149: design 100

CrispyPin#1149: god damnit the submit button did not seem to do anything so now there are 2 issues open
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> When do you finish your break again 😛 (Jk enjoy it, we gonna workaround everything)
Ecconia#4929: Talking about directional, the circuit boards have their position in one corner. So if you move that corner all components relative to that corner get moved 😦
CrispyPin#1149: it is also directional <:thonk:905552672432721961>
Biggycheese69420#4947: Same
Ecconia#4929: Uff this happened to me today :/ <[newline]> Please make an issue for it (ya can link this video)
CrispyPin#1149: this is interesting

CrispyPin#1149: floating point issues are axis dependent
Ecconia#4929: When resizing something drags child-components along....
Limón#7879: you can flip xors back accident if you are building upside down aswell
circuitgamer77#0377: Good to know :)  I'll be using that when I get back to my desktop :)
Limón#7879: it is
theLegolink#4344: Ah, alright. I might've accidentally hit f or something.
commander of the pandas#1576: Press f to flip XORs or anything in that matter, a flipped xor isn’t a bug but the way you produced it probably was?
circuitgamer77#0377: I hope that's reproduceable - it would be super helpful for some builds.
theLegolink#4344: I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature or something, but I think one of my XORs is backwards.
Daimh#5870: I am not sure what this is but I have never seen this message before
Theix#5229: I don't know if this has been addressed, but when you have a 1x2 panel display, there's no limit to the input count, so you get this pretty mess.
CrispyPin#1149: also relay bug again
CrispyPin#1149: this happened after stepping 1000
Reese4221#8317: put down a mount resize it and undo
Reese4221#8317: undoing a mount resize seems to cause fun problems:
Crevette#1444: The games crash after
NxthingbutV0id#1939: also quitting the game while doing ^that and loading back into the save will crash your game
NxthingbutV0id#1939: When copy and pasting large complex structures, where you placed them, they turn into ghost block and any block you place before its done loading can't be deleted and will intercect other parts
circuitgamer77#0377: Try switching to render distance 30 before loading - that seems to work a reasonable amount of the time.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I got a world save that crashes to desktop a second or so after it loads. Can I upload it so y'all can debug it? It skips the error screen and goes straight to desktop, and I couldn't find anything in the log files either.
Buzz#6223:

ieee 802.11ac#6337: the one where the links opening would take forever and (usually, for me) would only open the links after the game was closed
CrispyPin#1149: what bug?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: i stand corrected
ieee 802.11ac#6337: the linux Log In bug is still a thing and it's still annoying
Biggycheese69420#4947: indded
Artin_#3197: suffering
Biggycheese69420#4947: 
Biggycheese69420#4947: pain
101#1688: Probably, the internal server is skipping over your pulse and the client is never hearing about it 😬
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yea I suppose that's pretty far then.
Limón#7879: It took minutes to fly up
Limón#7879: Yeah
Sekoia#3968: so 2^17 tiles high
Sekoia#3968: oh okay
Limón#7879: So double that
Limón#7879: Since mounts can be 2 tiles high
Limón#7879: Kinda
Limón#7879: Yeah
Sekoia#3968: 65000 tiles up more or less
Sekoia#3968: 2^16 lmfao
Limón#7879: And then built a platform
Limón#7879: I stacked 2^16 mounts
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: How high is "really high?" I've made a unity world of 10km from origin and still snapped to grid perfectly fine.
Sekoia#3968: nothing much you can do except add a vertical height limit tbh
Artin_#3197: this only happens to me when stacking boards upon boards upon boards and so forth upwards
Limón#7879: Colliders no longer match what is shown
Limón#7879: If you go up really high floating point errors become common
PseudoGoose#2841: so for stuff like sound effects, should probably be detected server-side and sent as an event to the client
PseudoGoose#2841: ohhh yeah that makes sense - if the tick rate is faster than the server sends update packets, then the client could miss some stuff like that.
circuitgamer77#0377: Just noticed another one - If the game doesn't render a wire being on, it also doesn't play any drums that are driven by that pulse.  I'm running a sequencer on 1 tick pulses, and occasionally the game doesn't draw the 1 tick pulse, which means it also doesn't play the sound from the drum.
circuitgamer77#0377: And I can't resize the board that peg is placed on...
circuitgamer77#0377: And when I try to place this peg in the middle of the square, it snaps to the top of the square on being placed.  If I try to place it further down, it snaps up by 1/3 of the tile.
circuitgamer77#0377: Major location error (floating point?):  These sockets are floating off of the board, and the worst are also missing their face texture.
Sekoia#3968: anecdotal but I tried it at one point on Pop!OS and it was fine
Xasin#9114: Still an occouring problem on the Linux build (running on Debian atm.)

reklrekl#3271: First I thought is a problem with my modded components, but it also happens in Vanilla on a fresh save.  <[newline]>  <[newline]> While fiddling with the Bug I also found out some weird Behaviour with Fast Buffers, though these won't crash the Server <[newline]>  <[newline]> Bug video (clock also just for show): <[newline]> https://youtu.be/spBuzeJfyQw

Limón#7879: Where when I place down a component it places a wrong component
Limón#7879: What about the scroll wheel bug thing
Artin_#3197: great
CrispyPin#1149: known and will be fixed in 0.90.3
Artin_#3197: i have an issue where the music volume doesn't apply after restarting the game. it only works when i set it again in the settings
km#1297: that would be awesome but no it was my world I didn't realize I had accidentally named a world `
Dragon Lord#6944: Have you checked to see if it's an Easter egg world? <:megathink:797979154549178399>
km#1297: haha ikr, prob due to same issue of text input at same time as open console
Verlio_H#0201: the real question is why do you have a world named `
km#1297: and I had a world named ` for some reason SMH
km#1297: I guess the issue is just that it fills in your search bar and opens the console at same time
km#1297: ill add an issue unless someone knows if its known
km#1297: couldn't find this in issue tracker, repro: open logic world, view list of sandboxes, open console, list disappears replaced by one entry with ` as the name
CrispyPin#1149: or any other input
CrispyPin#1149: it's not specifically looking away from the board, you just need to move the mouse a tiny bit
Dragon Lord#6944: That is a known Linux bug.
DADp#7461: 🤔
Ecconia#4929: Not sure which server it is disconnecting from... <[newline]> Unless someone fiddled with LW.
Ecconia#4929: Huh, that's the client log? Weird looks different for me. <[newline]> Next should be `[Scene Loader] Loading main menu` <[newline]> after the "Online -" message
nuratic#2027: I do have a network connection. but according to the logs it is an issue with network <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> 2021-11-22T17:25:52Z | INFO  | [TextLocalizer] Detected system language as English <[newline]> 2021-11-22T17:25:52Z | INFO  | [Lidgren network client] Initialized network client on port 58733 using protocol IPv6_DualStack <[newline]> 2021-11-22T17:25:52Z | INFO  | [Online manager] Setting status to Online -  <[newline]> 2021-11-22T17:26:25Z | INFO  | [Lidgren network client] Disconnecting from server: quitting game <[newline]> 2021-11-22T17:26:25Z | INFO  | [Online manager] Setting status to Offline -  <[newline]> ```
Ecconia#4929: Do you have a network connection (active)? Cause if not that is one of the possible reasons. <[newline]> You should open the log files and check the content.
Ecconia#4929: Linux? <[newline]> Yes known issue. The bug happens as soon as you change the hotbar item with your mouse-wheel. To prevent it from happening, some other input event which is not click, has to happen. <[newline]> So you can move the camera, open the action wheel or chat.
101#1688: Not sure then
nuratic#2027: game start
101#1688: At what point? World load or game start?
nuratic#2027: I am still getting the issue where it is stuck on the the loading screen. This is using the files downloaded from itch.io (Version 0.90.2). The game works as it should while running the steam version. <[newline]>  <[newline]> I am having this issue on both Windows 11 and Ubuntu.
101#1688: I asked about this previously but didn’t get a response (pretty sure it got buried)
101#1688: Does anyone else have an issue whereby when placing a component, sometimes another component from the hot-bar will be selected and placed instead? Once it starts, it happens consistently until I look away from the board that I’m working on.
Mystyc Cheez#4812: darn
PseudoGoose#2841: <@!109085911672709120>
PseudoGoose#2841: yes, unfortunately it started happening in 0.90.2
Mystyc Cheez#4812: I assume its a bug that it doesnt autosave
Mystyc Cheez#4812: how do I save a color configuration?
PseudoGoose#2841: oh, yeah. but it's mostly write-only stuff like logs
HomelikeBrick42#1173: there are more folders at `C:\Users\SOME_USER\AppData\LocalLow\Mouse Hat Games`
doongi01#7242: that worked, thanks!
doongi01#7242: ok
PseudoGoose#2841: if you don't have anything you want to keep, you can try uninstalling and making sure the game folder is completely deleted before reinstalling it
PseudoGoose#2841: it is where the game is downloaded, e.g. in the default steamapps folder if you use that
doongi01#7242: wheres the save data stored?
doongi01#7242: maybe its a corrupted save file? if stored elsewhere like in the My Documents folder it could get excluded from the whole uninstall reinstall thing
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you said that you tried it in your message 🤦
HomelikeBrick42#1173: oh right
doongi01#7242: ive tried those, hasn't worked
HomelikeBrick42#1173: and if that doesnt work try reinstalling the game?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: if you bought the game though steam try running `Verify integrity of game files`
doongi01#7242: theres error screen and log
doongi01#7242: 
doongi01#7242: I just bought the game and booted it up for the first time and while it was loading my power went out and my pc shut off. When it came back on I booted up the game again and was met with an error screen, tried clicking Main Menu and got the same error screen. I've tried verifying integrity of game files, reinstalling and still no luck
Daimh#5870: Sometimes the colors do save and sometimes they revert back to the default grayscale

km#1297: ~~If the music issue is annoying anyone what I ended up doing is moving the tracks in GameData/MHG/music elsewhere on my system, game starts gracefully without them. Not sure if next steam update will automatically replace them so backed up to be safe~~ edit: well it kinda works but at least one track will randomly play at startup still
sybergoosejr#8256: BUG: i had a custom tile world set to 8x8 floor but now the floor is back to default after updating.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think that's a global bug...  Same here.
sybergoosejr#8256: same bug here 😄
conorpo#1572: sometimes when duplicating something, the border shows as red always, even though when you actually click it places fine
HuntaBadday#3556: Every time the game boots, the game automatically sets the music volume to max regardless of the setting, this may happen to other audio too
N3ld4s1#0366: ahh ok, good to know👍
Ecconia#4929: For now you have to move the slider to 0 again at every start
Ecconia#4929: will be fixed in the next update
Ecconia#4929: known and already reported bug
N3ld4s1#0366: Does anyone have issues with the music in game? i have it trun al the way down and it just starts on its own, or when i start the game its playing. i have to move the slider up an down again for it to stop.
Daimh#5870: Hopefully you never will :) Because you have to make a huge machine in order to take up enough space to get there
DADp#7461: good
Limón#7879: never been there
DADp#7461: the world border
Limón#7879: what's the forcefield thing
CrispyPin#1149: will do
Jimmy#8080: Oh god damn it, more AMD linux text crap. This should be fixable, please make an issue for it. Related to https://logicworld.net/tracker/87 which was fixed in 0.90.2
Satan#9850: I built it last version
Daimh#5870: I don't remember it being this laggy last update 🤔 So maybe an optimization messed with it? Unless I'm just doing something differently
Daimh#5870: 2x2 9 pin displays lag quite a bit when placing just one at a time
Satan#9850: The colors i choose wont save.
Daimh#5870: (They dont match the values in the menu)
Daimh#5870: The new update kinda broke the way audio works, so the game always seems to start at 100% audio even if previously set to 50%
Chime#3134: And I mean I'm sure it's very nice music but when I'm logicking I like to listen to my tunes.  _metal screaming_
Chime#3134: interesting.  yeah...
DADp#7461: imma make that an issue
DADp#7461: for somereason it starts at 100
DADp#7461: you just have to move the slider up then back down
DADp#7461: yea it is
Chime#3134: I'm maybe derping but the music doesn't seem disableable in .90.2?  Lowest setting is Rarely, music vol 0%, still plays.
DADp#7461: 
DADp#7461: 
DADp#7461: 
DADp#7461: 
Miroum#7235: Yes
DADp#7461: :D
DADp#7461: wrong channel
Miroum#7235: Sorry I made a mistake. No problem.
Moldytzu#4226: and what's the problem with it?
Miroum#7235: Yes it's Steam link
Moldytzu#4226: steam link?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: what's the bug/issue
ieee 802.11ac#6337: ?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: 2. set all AND gates to 4-input
ieee 802.11ac#6337: how to recreate: 1. set up 3 AND gates like this
ieee 802.11ac#6337: (3 4-input AND gates clipped into each other)
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hmmmm
Ecconia#4929: Oh right, apparently the monospace thing is fixed, is it?
Stenodyon#8192: oh yeah same
CrispyPin#1149: exported and now this <:thonk:905552672432721961>
Dragon Lord#6944: Or rather that it was naive to think that 'the relationship stopped at three dimensions'.
Dragon Lord#6944: Well, he said that the dimensions extended beyond three dimensions in the book...
RyanT#1426: huh?
CrispyPin#1149: 16 units in the time dimension <:thonk:598604478413013002>
CrispyPin#1149: hadnt thought of that
Dragon Lord#6944: Nope
Dragon Lord#6944: I suppose it's technically 1x4x9x16x25x...
CrispyPin#1149: did you see my monolith build
CrispyPin#1149: yea
Dragon Lord#6944: You mean lack of color?
Dragon Lord#6944: 1x4x9
CrispyPin#1149: let alone colour
CrispyPin#1149: it's not even the right proportions
CrispyPin#1149: bruh
Dragon Lord#6944: 2001 A space Odyssey just called, they want their monolith back
DADp#7461: im in disbelief
DADp#7461: on start, music will play, even though music volume can be 0
Moldytzu#4226: there are a couple of words that are missing
Moldytzu#4226: can't see the whole message
CrispyPin#1149: i replaced the files from a backup and it still does not load them <:thonk:905552672432721961>
CrispyPin#1149: at least i think thats the problem
CrispyPin#1149: they are still there but the order file is reset so it doesnt load them
Ecconia#4929: An oh noes, all the display configurations are kind of gone :/
Ecconia#4929: Pfew, recovered it. Just spawned outside of existence. So tp'ing back to existence helps.
Ecconia#4929: And illuminati has invated my render view
Ecconia#4929: My experience with LW V0.90.2 so far:
CrispyPin#1149: but the order was reset and so doesn't include them
CrispyPin#1149: they still seem to exist in the  folder
CrispyPin#1149: either that or they were not sent to my client
CrispyPin#1149: all non-default display configurations disappeared after updating
circuitgamer77#0377: I just searched "is luck finite" on Google, an there's some weird articles that come up...
PseudoGoose#2841: 🤔
PseudoGoose#2841: aliens be like: what a strange practice these humans have traditionalized
PseudoGoose#2841: no, maybe when you wish someone luck, you are voluntarily giving up some of your own luck so you have a greater chance of seeing someone else succeed
circuitgamer77#0377: Question - is luck a finite or infinite resource?  If you wish someone luck, does everyone else become very slightly less lucky for the duration of the wish?
circuitgamer77#0377: You have been wished luck :)
Jimmy#8080: wish me luck
Jimmy#8080: Only one more bug I want to fix for this update: the infamous Cuddle Bug
circuitgamer77#0377: (no, please don't...)
circuitgamer77#0377: Quick, what other bug can we find to delay the update more?
PseudoGoose#2841: okay I have a response for this - not all flat boards are the same. They can be rotated while holding down left mouse before placing the first corner. And in my testing, the game seems to remember which orientation you used the last time you placed the board. <[newline]> And yes, in that case, if the board is "pre-rotated", it does not need to be / should not be rotated in between placing and toggling flatness to reproduce the bug.
Jimmy#8080: Bug is fixed!
Jimmy#8080: don't let the fame get to your head
circuitgamer77#0377: View!
PseudoGoose#2841: <:frog_happy:733352650091003955>
circuitgamer77#0377: and the people who - ok, I'll stop now.
circuitgamer77#0377: and the people who study electricity
circuitgamer77#0377: and the people who design computers
circuitgamer77#0377: And the people who designed the internet...  and the people who optimised it...
circuitgamer77#0377: But the people who made Discord also helped, because we're using it to communicate...  so a LOT of hands!
PseudoGoose#2841: but also jimmy is involved so 6 hands
circuitgamer77#0377: 4 hands in total
PseudoGoose#2841: how to singlehandedly delay LW releases (though technically with 2 hands)
Jimmy#8080: Thank you as well!
circuitgamer77#0377: I put a save with that board in <#901199821212352573> as well, if you need it.
Jimmy#8080: Excellent video, thank you very much. On it
circuitgamer77#0377: Probably isn't, but I thought I'd mention it.
circuitgamer77#0377: Could it be related to a thing I noticed where if the game lags too much the music stops and doesn't come back until reload?
Reese4221#8317: funky
Jimmy#8080: I don't think so, it plays fine in VLC and Reaper (the two tools I used to investigate)
circuitgamer77#0377: I haven't needed to rotate the board while flat...  We have different results there.
PseudoGoose#2841: <@!154964593397989376> here is a video demonstrating how to reproduce the fine-placing boards bug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNOeABbblpc
Reese4221#8317: not sure if this could be it but maybe something is wrong with the audio file itself?
Jimmy#8080: It's not just you, I can consistently reproduce it. Applause is just broken for some reason
km#1297: I'm really putting that Synthesizer through a hard time but hope to post something fun soon
km#1297: anytime! thank you for the game! wonder if I somehow corrupted my particular version or if others have the issue too
Jimmy#8080: Thanks for the investigation <@652201352197308457> , I looked into it but I don't know why that particular effect is all fucky. I'm removing it in 0.90.2
km#1297: Follow up observation about applause sfx since I had to revisit it just now: Just selecting the sound effect once in the x menu makes that particular singer refuse to sing anything else anymore or play any instruments. So it may just be a case of sudden incapacitating stage fright. Clicked through every other sound and its really just that one
Jimmy#8080: fixed for 0.90.2
Michael#8718: Multi-select (Z) and then delete (R), might crash.  Interestingly, it deleted some or all of the selected objects, so when I reloaded, I could not easily re-produce bug to send
Jimmy#8080: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pco91kroVgQ
km#1297: tried one more time with no mods enabled to ensure nothing else was causing it and found you can do an even simpler repro to make it crash: 2 singers set to applause on default note, both wired to one button. spam click till reality ends
km#1297: https://youtu.be/n3Lxq7F51uw
km#1297: I found a way I can get the game to freeze up requiring me to kill the process. Repro steps: 1) place a couple singers, choose "Applause" instrument, everything else default. 2) Wire up singers to a clock made of a couple delayers (interval doesn't have to be very fast, happened with delayers set to 10). 3) reflect on life as the simulation grinds to a halt. It's weird because I have taken singers to much more extremes than in this test, but maybe other instrument sounds don't pile up as severely.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think loading the save was coincidental - whenever I've had this crash it's been immediately after an attempted system update changes the mode of the background intelligent transfer service (which I've learned is anything but intelligent).  This time it was an update for the "your phone" app, which I can't use with this PC anyway...
circuitgamer77#0377: 2001 is invading my computer...
circuitgamer77#0377: Looks like it's working this time.  I'm going to check my system logs.
circuitgamer77#0377: First restart didn't work, trying again...
circuitgamer77#0377: Best guess is my graphics card was overloaded.
circuitgamer77#0377: And now it's dead.  Restarting my PC...
circuitgamer77#0377: Has happened before with other programs, so it might not be Logic World.
circuitgamer77#0377: Computer just completely locked up while loading a save, sending this from my phone...
circuitgamer77#0377: My confusion is that it's different after reloading the world - it was fine before I closed the program, but now that I've reopened it it's struggling.
Daimh#5870: ~~Could it be because you built a whole computer?~~ <:7ACOSP_lmao:755810746310459432>
circuitgamer77#0377: I reduced my render distance even further - it's not stuttering any more but GPU usage is still at 90%-95%
circuitgamer77#0377: It's maxed out my GPU before, but not to the extent that everything is stuttering and lagging (including audio)
circuitgamer77#0377: Don't know if this fits here, but this is the first time that Logic World is causing my whole PC to stutter.  Just loaded into the same world as before, on a lower resolution, and the GPU usage is way higher than before.
CrispyPin#1149: soon™️
Jimmy#8080: also this ^
CrispyPin#1149: type clear in it
Satan#9850: The console is extremely slow in servers, it freezes my game for about a minute
Ecconia#4929: <@!548699973672370222> ask questions in <#901199821212352573>
circuitgamer77#0377: It's fun to find examples of what we're learning in class.  I've pretty much learned everything in class before the class started, but it's still fun.
circuitgamer77#0377: Or something else entirely?
circuitgamer77#0377: How are the messages for the console stored?  Just a long list, a queue, a deque, something in between...
Jimmy#8080: Yep, I added a workaround for 0.90.2, proper fix coming later
Limón#7879: I think too many error messages crashes the game
Mystyc Cheez#4812: the shorter one works, longer not so much
Mystyc Cheez#4812: 
Mystyc Cheez#4812: this connection is allowed, but the next is not:
HomelikeBrick42#1173: it does <[newline]> <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types>
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know, I've never used C#.  I can understand the code that's been decompiled, but I don't really know how to program in C# yet.
Sekoia#3968: C# doesn't have unsigned integers, does it?
circuitgamer77#0377: Wait - pausing and unpausing the game restarted the simulation.  Maybe it checked for the command on unpause?
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll try that at some point...  My guess is that is simulates super fast (integer underflow), but I have no clue.
Sekoia#3968: What happens if you set it to negative, actually?
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm guessing it checks for commands once every simulation tick, so setting it to 0 means no commands will go through.
circuitgamer77#0377: I set the simulation rate to 0, and now I can't get the game to simulate again.  I'm going to reload the world, hopefully that will fix it.
circuitgamer77#0377: Chat spam with vertical boards debugging
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm going to do some further testing...  I think a thread would be good if we keep testing though.
Daimh#5870: Honestly we should start a thread if we continue this bug hunt :)
Daimh#5870: 
circuitgamer77#0377: For me the number of messages seemed to directly relate to how many boards are being moved.  I should test timing too, though.
Daimh#5870: They only show up when I copy more than one, and move it (then it seems to spam a 1 every tick)
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm wondering if it spams 0, 2, or 3 instead.
circuitgamer77#0377: also, just curious, what happens if you rotate them once while moving them?
circuitgamer77#0377: When you reload, do those appear on load, or do you have to actually move them?  For me it's just on movement.
Daimh#5870: I made a fresh world and cleared console before this video, placed vertical boards and now console is just 1s
Daimh#5870: Looks like you're right
circuitgamer77#0377: By vertically placed I mean any board placed that isn't flat on it's parent.
circuitgamer77#0377: It could easily be from somewhere else too.
circuitgamer77#0377: The biggest challenge is that decompiled code does not have comments, so I have no help there...  I've seen that spam when moving or cloning vertical boards, and I've checked to make sure that's actually the case.  How many vertically placed boards do you have in your world?
Daimh#5870: The only thing I have in this would that would send so many messages are the pegs.
circuitgamer77#0377: Those are debug messages from something...  I've gotten those too, and Jimmy is working to remove them soon.  I've been trying to find them in the code - it's a fun challenge.
Daimh#5870: It has a ton of messages only containing "1"
Daimh#5870: Hmm
circuitgamer77#0377: Or just screenshots...
circuitgamer77#0377: I want to compare it to mine.
circuitgamer77#0377: I might test that one later...  Seems like an easy enough thing to test.  Can you send a copy of what's in your console after you join?
Daimh#5870: Could be a coincidence though I am not sure
Daimh#5870: I had 3 crashes in a row, cleared console after getting on again and it hasn't crashed again
circuitgamer77#0377: I could very well be wrong though.
circuitgamer77#0377: Sure it's the console causing it, and they aren't both symptoms?  The kind of thing that causes that crash also tends to spam the console.
Daimh#5870: (The number seems random every time so idk what is going on though)
Daimh#5870: I also noticed that for some reason when my console got filled with lots of stuff, this frequently would happen when multi-deleting pegs
Vynix#3003: Windows would be the dominant OS, as that is what most people use anyway.
Vynix#3003: There are a LOT of Linux users here, more than most game related servers. You can find some of them in <#899025505406296094> thread, where we just talk Linux.
Daimh#5870: Its extremely exaggerated to show the effect but this sometimes happens randomly with smaller numbers of sockets too.
Daimh#5870: Here is a world that consistently reproduces the issue if you select half the boards and delete them
Daimh#5870: Nevermind
Daimh#5870: So sockets arent the issue. something else interacting with sockets are weird
Sekoia#3968: I mean the second you're native you boost your numbers anyway
Sekoia#3968: yup, but probably not that much anyway
Verlio_H#0201: probably a lot more linux than the average
Sekoia#3968: ... i also forgot about that lol
circuitgamer77#0377: Logic World has screenshots builtin too, if that helps.
Sekoia#3968: I'm just too used to using the shortcuts, I completely forgot there was the app
circuitgamer77#0377: I wonder what the OS distribution for people with this game is?
Sekoia#3968: I actually do have a delay tho
Sekoia#3968: yeah I'm not on windows lol
circuitgamer77#0377: If you aren't on Windows, I don't know...
circuitgamer77#0377: If you're on Windows, the Snipping Tool has a timer option, so you can tell it to take a screenshot in 3 or 10 seconds, and after you click that switch to Logic World.
Sekoia#3968: sorry, I can't really grab screenshots or anything because the game captures the mouse. I'll try and describe it better this afternoon, can't rn
Saltypretzel#0321: i want more cursed component
Saltypretzel#0321: ~~nooo you fixed it~~
Daimh#5870: I will get another world up and send as soon as I get back home
Jimmy#8080: I would love to fix this issue for you but I can't fix what I can't reproduce
Jimmy#8080: "just select the thing on the circuit board that's mostly incomplete" - I have no idea what this means, and I've played around with this world a bunch but I've been unable to produce any errors. Can you please give more specific instructions, or better yet, record a video of you causing the bug?
Daimh#5870: Well I mean on this world I have not had a crash yet. This was the first
Sekoia#3968: that seems to happen relatively often lol
Daimh#5870: It was a really small build with not very many things in it so idk why this caused it to crash (since previously this was not an issue)
Daimh#5870: Idk if error codes help but here I removed a NAND gate I made and this just showed up.
Dragon Lord#6944: It's longer ;)
Daimh#5870: But this wire is possible? <:LUL:707664722043863070>
Dragon Lord#6944: Wasn't a shorter minimum wire distance part of the 0.90.1 update? I think it used to be a bit worse XD
Daimh#5870: I can see the wire with my eyeballs :)
Daimh#5870: I honestly think this should be able to connect
Minivan#5300: TIL
Sekoia#3968: > A repeater set to a delay of two to four redstone ticks increases the length of any shorter on-pulse to match the length of the repeater's delay, and suppress any shorter off-pulse. For example, a repeater set to a 4-tick delay changes a 1-tick, 2-tick, or 3-tick on-pulse into a 4-tick on-pulse, and does not allow through any off-pulse shorter than 4 ticks.  <[newline]> huh, you're right
Ecconia#4929: No that is not how Minecraft repeaters work. <[newline]> They also do not buffer pulses. <[newline]> If you input a 1-tick pulse in a 2 tick repeater, you get a 2 tick pulse.
Ecconia#4929: Yes
Minivan#5300: im sure people expect the delayer to work like a redstone repeater (iirc) that actually delays the incoming signal, and does not capacitate the signal
Minivan#5300: this is so unintuitive
Minivan#5300: so the only way to make a "true" delayer that actually delays the signal as it is coming in, is to string together buffers or 1-tick delayers?
Ecconia#4929: But it can go off more early, if you have more off ticks than on ticks. It kind of discharges and charges, once the output is active.
Ecconia#4929: Although it is called delayer, it behaves more like a capacitor. <[newline]> If your delay length is 3, then you need a 3 tick long signal, to turn the output on. <[newline]> Once the output is on, you need the input wire to be off for 3 ticks, for the output to be off.
Ecconia#4929: That is a bug. (Already reported)
Minivan#5300: i dont think so, cus 2 ticks propagate fine through the 3 tick delay
Ecconia#4929: That is intended behavior.
Minivan#5300: When using a Delay with value bigger than 1, and sending a 1 tick long signal into the delay, the signal will not propagate through the delay. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Console command used: <[newline]>  <[newline]> `server "simulation.rate 1"` <[newline]>  <[newline]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU0V21OZuj0
nuratic#2027: Yes on both
Ecconia#4929: Like are you connected to your router etc (does not need internet) <[newline]> -> Uff then I do not know.
Ecconia#4929: Do you have a network connection (enabled)?
nuratic#2027: My laptop is some 8th gen i7 apu, 16gb ram, it runs well via steam client, just not the itch.io version <[newline]>  <[newline]> My desktop is Ryzen 5 5600x, 32gb ram and 3060ti, again it runs as it should through steam, just has issues with the itch.io version
trucksarenoisy#4659: it runs fine on my potato
trucksarenoisy#4659: what is your specs
nuratic#2027: I have downloaded the game via itch.io for Linux (Ubuntu) and the game got stuck on the loading screen. I tried it on Win11 and the same has happened with that as well
HomelikeBrick42#1173: use the command `noclip` to get back above the ground
Verlio_H#0201: *daniel stream flashbacks*
Smaller Abyss#1716: I don't know how it happened, but I managed to get under the world.
ieee 802.11ac#6337: still have the log in bug
HomelikeBrick42#1173: yes that happens whenever you get that crash
Lolbird123#3621: and after attempting to remove 1 peg, instead of removing just that peg, it removed the board under the board it was attached to, and everything on it <[newline]> nevermind that was apparently a visual bug fixed after restarting the game
Lolbird123#3621: although the socket move did succeed, after loading the world again
Lolbird123#3621: i multi-selected 10 sockets, started moving them all one place left, and when i clicked to confirm, logs below, and above because discord doent follow the upload order i chose
Lolbird123#3621: 
Lolbird123#3621: 
Ecconia#4929: And due to my internet being annoying today, I was not able to make an issue yet... <[newline]> And will only do that, once I got my good internet back <[newline]> *Actually have more than one issue to report...
Jimmy#8080: I'll see what I can do
Ecconia#4929: The server even spits out a stacktrace then.
Ecconia#4929: Wait am I playing on a pirated version of LW? 😱  <[newline]> The game still gets stuck in the loading screen if there is "no internet connection". <[newline]> Or so. I experienced some pain there today. Like if I turn off WiFi it won't launch. <[newline]> But there are already two bug reports for this in the issue tracker.
Daimh#5870: Yeah I think this is the same issue
Sekoia#3968: yup, I can cause the crash reliably
Sekoia#3968: here's the world, just select the thing on the circuit board that's mostly incomplete
Sekoia#3968: maybe these are better?
Sekoia#3968: hm, not very descriptive logs lol
Sekoia#3968: I do believe this is the same crash?
Jimmy#8080: Can you make a world where this happens every time, reliably, and then send me the world?
circuitgamer77#0377: I agree, this is actually super helpful and I would have a lot more trouble reconfiguring circuits if this is fixed.
Aced Timo#3823: Sounds good!
Daimh#5870: Do you think the socket issue will be fixed any time soon? :) (Where deleting/copying more than 30 sockets crashes the game)
CrispyPin#1149: but i know this is more work
CrispyPin#1149: i'd say there should be an option to keep connections, maybe in a special state so they no longer transmit signals
CrispyPin#1149: it's so useful for when temporarily pulling a circuit apart, for example to resize a structural component in the middle
CrispyPin#1149: oh nooo
Jimmy#8080: If you can reliably reproduce this, please make a ticket on the tracker with step-by-step instructions
Jimmy#8080: Yep, will be fixed for 0.90.2
Jimmy#8080: Fixed for 0.90.2
Jimmy#8080: This was a bug with 0.90.0, which AFAIK all the pirated copies are still on. I fixed it in 0.90.1
Mystyc Cheez#4812: (maybe 50/50, seems kinda random tbh)
Mystyc Cheez#4812: (unrelated, but almost every time i try to move a circuitboard, the (server?) crashes lol)
Mystyc Cheez#4812: (note: the relay version didnt work by doing this)
Mystyc Cheez#4812: all i needed to do was to add buffers alongside the inverters
Mystyc Cheez#4812: im a brain genious
Mystyc Cheez#4812: well its simply not doing what im hoping for
Mystyc Cheez#4812: 🤔
Stenodyon#8192: they're working but they have a 1 tick delay
Mystyc Cheez#4812: normal and gates dont work either, but works wrong differently 🥴
Mystyc Cheez#4812: I was under the impression that a relay is instant though
Mystyc Cheez#4812: also I really dont want to do that because then it will be slow 😭
Mystyc Cheez#4812: how do you increase the length of a signal?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think it can if you add some delay in a few places.
Mystyc Cheez#4812: it works, but not with 1 tick pulses i guess
Mystyc Cheez#4812: what ive made is a 3-7 encoder
Mystyc Cheez#4812: hmmmmmmmm
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll be back in about 10 minutes...
circuitgamer77#0377: If I'm seeing this right, you could just delay the inputs into the back of the relays of the last row by 1 tick.
circuitgamer77#0377: What were you trying to do?
Limón#7879: Buffers are instant if that's what you are looking for
Mystyc Cheez#4812: if only there was a way 😔
Mystyc Cheez#4812: guess ill have to rethink everything
Mystyc Cheez#4812: DAMN
circuitgamer77#0377: That looks fine, relays take 1 tick to change state...
Mystyc Cheez#4812: not sure if intended behaviour or not
Mystyc Cheez#4812: what is going on here?
Mystyc Cheez#4812: brug moment
circuitgamer77#0377: Everything disappearing is a known bug, alt-f4 and restart fixes it...
Mystyc Cheez#4812: no collision either
Mystyc Cheez#4812: i tried moving a circuitboard and then everything but that circuitboard disappeared and i can no longer do anything but move around, like menus wont show or i cant scroll through items/highlight pieces
CrispyPin#1149: quantum and-gate
gnog#2259: 
Limón#7879: I had to have Firefox instead of Chromium open
Limón#7879: Did the same to me
Ecconia#4929: It should open your browser with a specific link. <[newline]> Something to the LW Auth server, which then forwards your client to a localhost:someport URL with the accessTokeb in the URL. So that LWs temporary Auth local server can capture that.
Daimh#5870: Same error when many sockets are duplicated or removed :)
Daimh#5870: I am also going to assume this is known, I deleted 4 D latches hooked up to XOR gates and this happened
ieee 802.11ac#6337: god no
PseudoGoose#2841: i misunderstood at first, thought /dev/sda2 was the symlink
ieee 802.11ac#6337: yeah, i prefer having my nvme drive function over long periods of time
PseudoGoose#2841: oh i think i understand
PseudoGoose#2841: > steam library symlinked to /dev/sda2 <[newline]> excuse me what
ieee 802.11ac#6337: no mods
ieee 802.11ac#6337: i'm on garuda linux and have my steam library symlinked to /dev/sda2
ieee 802.11ac#6337: it doesn't do anything at all in fact
ieee 802.11ac#6337: is it just me or what because for some reason clicking "log in" does not, in fact, log me in
CrispyPin#1149: nope
Daimh#5870: Also is it intended for you not to be able to edit a delayer when there is an output connected?
Daimh#5870: Ah ok :)
CrispyPin#1149: yeah duplicating things with a lot of sockets occasionally crashes
Daimh#5870: Its probably known as well but I wanted to bring it up in case it wasn't
Daimh#5870: Also when my little bro duplicates this structure he crashes <:Hmm:872602955881259009>
Daimh#5870: Ah ok <:miu_cool:501111536052338689>
CrispyPin#1149: this is well known
Daimh#5870: I hope this is known :p cause it feels so wrong to be able to do this
Daimh#5870: So apparently the Undo button also lets you re-connect cables that phase through blocks
HomelikeBrick42#1173: your computer got an extra 4% of computing power
km#1297: ran into this same issue yesterday or very similar also on linux. Game froze after changing a color in an 'x' panel iirc, nothing would respond at all / no mouse or keyboard response except ctrl+alt+f4  to open a new shell, then from TOP I saw LW process taking 100% cpu, tried to kill it by PID. logged back into graphical environment and it immediately froze again... LW was not killed. Back in shell LW now taking up 104% cpu. impressive. Killed again and this time it really died. Maybe first time was user error. Issue never happened again.
Daimh#5870: Also update: It seems that based on the console this happens whenever the game saves
Daimh#5870: I have seen that as well
Aced Timo#3823: Happens every time a new song is loaded while being ingame
Aced Timo#3823: One more bug ive encountered is that every time the game loads the background music it freezes for about one second. Not a big issue but i thought i might mention it
Daimh#5870: I will just be moving around and then suddenly my controls will have really long delays
Daimh#5870: Is it known that occasionally there will be what feels like network lag on the game?
Dragon Lord#6944: If you find it and patch it, you should sell it to Jimmy for $3
circuitgamer77#0377: I hope so...  I'm experimenting and digging through the code to find the slow part.
DADp#7461: wire optimization mod ?!?!
circuitgamer77#0377: One of my worlds takes 15 minutes to load on 30 render distance...  It can take a while...
Cody McGuire#0711: I thought they were just loading big worlds with too high a render distance and gotten impatient. I own a legitimate copy and some downloaded worlds take several minutes to load with the default render distance.
Satan#9850: Also soundtrack
Satan#9850: Y e s
Port-ably John#2804: next update should be free dlc, game is loading lol screensaver free for everyone
DADp#7461: :D
DADp#7461: subasseblies
CrispyPin#1149: the file with the greek omega in the name lol
CrispyPin#1149: well apparently one pirated source was missing a file
DADp#7461: tf <:thunking:446109191392985108>
Port-ably John#2804: So here's a funny, anyone asking why the game is stuck at a "Game is loading lol" screen has most likely pirated the game. i downloaded a pirated copy so i could give it a try before i bought, but was met with that, i will say i am a proud owner of the game now,  It's not a bug, it's a feature, and a good one at that
Jimmy#8080: Thank you so much!
Satan#9850: Loving the game so far
Satan#9850: oh hi jimmy
Jimmy#8080: Limitation of equirectangular projection. I'm going to change the main menu backgrounds to proper cubemaps which will fix this.
Ecconia#4929: I also had that. Seems that only this skybox has it. In only that edge.
Satan#9850: Weird line thing in the background of the start menu
CrispyPin#1149: well i still cant join my server, as soon as i load in (>5min) a "Job.Worker" process starts and nothing happens, i will load a backup later gonna do other things now
Ecconia#4929: Wow, restarting server and client did not help.... <[newline]> Lets try to make the world an SP world. -> Does not do anything either. <[newline]> Workaround: Move the board by 1, and then resize then move it back. <[newline]> Sent world to Jimmy for debugging.
Ecconia#4929: Resizing mode enabled: Check <[newline]> Board can be resized: Check <[newline]> Arrows to perform resizing: 🤔
CrispyPin#1149: gotta love ghost processes
CrispyPin#1149: busy with what, there is no cpu usage
CrispyPin#1149: <:thonk:598604478413013002>
CrispyPin#1149: gonna restart the server
Ecconia#4929: That is not breaking though. If it is not responding, that just means that the game is busy with something else besides processing window inputs. But yeah should not be the case anyway.
CrispyPin#1149: 
CrispyPin#1149: immediately breaks when i log in <:thonk:598604478413013002>
CrispyPin#1149: but i could kill it using its pid
CrispyPin#1149: running it a second time and it said there was no such process
CrispyPin#1149: i killed it with `killall Logic_World -KILL`
Ecconia#4929: Then you did not kill the correct process at first... <[newline]> Or your WindowManager does weird stuff. Anyway not LW's fault.
CrispyPin#1149: no i have linux
CrispyPin#1149: ok i finally killed it
CrispyPin#1149: i still have no cursor
CrispyPin#1149: what
Ecconia#4929: OS issue though. (I assume Windows... -> Then no clue)
CrispyPin#1149: killing the process did not remove the window...
CrispyPin#1149: it ate my cursor
CrispyPin#1149: heard a audio-crack thing and lw froze
Cody McGuire#0711: Just look at the the density achievable!
Cody McGuire#0711: Oh boy do I love impossibly placed circuit boards. Please never fix!
Ecconia#4929: Lol, pretty much not final...
Ecconia#4929: Save file specs: https://gist.github.com/JimmyCushnie/bebea37a21acbb6e669589967f9512a2 <[newline]>  <[newline]> Will help you understand the situation. <[newline]> From my experience parsing this and linking wires takes seconds at most even for big builds.
Toilet#3618: CAN CONFIRM THIS WORKED FOR ME I LOVE YOU
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll do more testing later, dinner time for me...
circuitgamer77#0377: This is better.  Efficiency index is not a physical value, but should be a good indication of how efficiently it loaded given the total number of objects in the world.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm going to make this into a spreadsheet...
circuitgamer77#0377: Except for empty world and Wires Small, those were to test a base case.
circuitgamer77#0377: All test worlds have had around 7800 components + wires (example - wires has 1326 components and 6732 wires, totaling 8058 objects).
circuitgamer77#0377: So far it looks like loading wires is the slowest:
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm wondering it it's board count - I have no proof/precise reason for it, but I'm wondering...  I'm going to test that.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm going to do some performance comparison testing in a bit, should be interesting...
101#1688: Alright, so that's not the cause 🤷‍♂️
Jimmy#8080: This is not correct. Wires are stored as a connection between two peg addresses. When rendering the wire, the game looks up the wire attachment point for those two pegs.
101#1688: As in, wire starts at some location, and ends at another location. Because of this, when you load the world, you have to figure out which peg the wire connects to from the position. Hence the slowness. <[newline]> Again, though, this is conjecture. I don't know if this is actually how it works.
gnog#2259: you mean physical position?
gnog#2259: what do you mean "wires are stored as a start and end position" ?
DADp#7461: which is acurrate
DADp#7461: that probably means they are worse than gates n stuff
DADp#7461: which would make sense
DADp#7461: double data
DADp#7461: each wire is
DADp#7461: so
DADp#7461: knowing jimmy he probably is storing two locations for the wire
101#1688: That way you don't have to search for the peg at the end of the wire.
DADp#7461: well hold on
101#1688: And using indices into a list of pegs instead.
101#1688: Smart way is not using positions to store wires.
DADp#7461: smart way is having the output have a list of the relative position to the input
101#1688: Of course, I can't see his code, so this is a stab in the dark
101#1688: Sure, but if this is implemented naively, the total cost would be wires * pegs, thus, roughly quadratic assuming the ratio of wires to pegs is fairly constant
DADp#7461: i wonder how he does it
DADp#7461: wires should be ~1/2 of the componet count
DADp#7461: seems weird but makes sense
101#1688: If so, the solution is either to index the peg positions in some way to speed up the search, or better still, store wires as a pair of peg indices and get the positions from the pegs themselves, which wouldn't require any sort of search at all.
101#1688: I have done some more experiments in effort to identify the cause of slow world loading, and I think I've figured it out. 90% sure it has to do with the number of wires. My hypothesis at the moment is that wires are stored as a start and end position that must be matched up with component pegs when the world is loaded. <@!154964593397989376> Can you confirm/deny this?
Dragon Lord#6944: Let's get some Beethoven paradox in here
Dragon Lord#6944: Does that mean that I can build circuits that just grab the correct answer out of the future?
DADp#7461: time travel confirmed logic world
Dragon Lord#6944: Yes, it's a Linux issue. It's on the bug tracker already.
101#1688: Anyone have an issue whereby the selected component spontaneously changes when trying to place it? Looking away from and back towards the board fixes it.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: I’ve tried that to no avail, the game loads but like 3s after crashes to desktop
circuitgamer77#0377: Including me
circuitgamer77#0377: Try loading the world with 30 render distance - that's fixed it for everyone I've seen try it.
Toilet#3618: I've had this issue on 2 saves now with no fix
HappySpleen#7516: no problem, I know this was driving me nuts till I sat down and figured out how to avoid it.
Aced Timo#3823: Thanks for the info
HappySpleen#7516: Yeah me and another user were talking about it on the bug tracker, best way to avoid the crash right now is to move the group (Not just limited to sockets but it happens for any part that is/can be fine placed) to another location all together then move it into the place you want it. So that the pick up and replacement  never over laps.
Aced Timo#3823: Another crash after trying to move two sockets which were connected <[newline]> `[SceneAndNetworkManager] going to error screen with message: "Tried to remove entity from circuit states manager, but it didn't appear in the index specified (339)"`
Aced Timo#3823: Not sure if this was reported before but attempting to reposition a group of sockets that have a wire connection to whatever it may be, will crash the game
Ecconia#4929: No it was not fixed in 0.90.1 according to changelog.
Radiant#3222: Jimmy:"The bug will be fixed in 0.90.1 so you cant clip wires" <[newline]> 0.90.1: hello <[newline]> me:

circuitgamer77#0377: Nope, just the single character in the message...
Ecconia#4929: does it contain more info, once you copy it? (Jimmy asked us to copy a messages of these)
circuitgamer77#0377: Only seeing 0 and 1 could line up with  `this.boardPlacer.RotationState` because that is limited to 0 through 3, but that isn't proof at all.
circuitgamer77#0377: There's a line in StuffGrabber.cs that says `Debug.Log((object) this.boardPlacer.RotationState);`, but after tracing the code I don't know if the debug log goes to the terminal or a separate unity log.
circuitgamer77#0377: (also, this happening a lot seems to correlate with the game increasing it's GPU usage to 90-100% until I restart it.  That could be related to something else, but it's a correlation.)
circuitgamer77#0377: narrowed even further down - multiselecting, then hitting G, then hitting escape without even moving the mouse does it.
circuitgamer77#0377: Not even moving them - just multiselecting them, starting to move them, then hitting escape spams the terminal too.
circuitgamer77#0377: 
circuitgamer77#0377: I've narrowed it down a bit - cloning or moving the two boards on top causes the terminal to be spammed with 1s, regardless of how they are positioned relative to each other, but doing the same for the bottom two boards does not print anything to the terminal.  I've only been able to cause this to happen by moving boards that are attached on their edge rather than flat.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think it's specifically when cloning two boards that are not connected using multiselect - I can't get it to happen without doing that.
circuitgamer77#0377: yes - cloning is definetly the cause.  I just cleared the terminal, copied something, then immediately opened the terminal again to see a ton of 1s.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think this is only happening when I'm cloning, which might be causing some lag (possibly - I know printing to terminals can be a very slow part of a program)
circuitgamer77#0377: Now it's printing 1s...
HappySpleen#7516: Odd thing... as I was reading this back I looked over at my game and I was back to 60 FPS again. Flying around and placing new components does not cause it to drop but reloading does. This happened in my project world as well but when back to low FPS once I sent any signal through the circuit.
HappySpleen#7516: Yep so after some testing around 1304 singers brings the FPS down to 37-38 in an empty world where as over 36000 sockets did nothing to the FPS what so ever. I thought this might be related to lighting or shadows but even with all settings at the lowest/disabled it made no FPS difference and since there is no culling in the game (as far as I can tell) trapping it all in a box does not help the FPS at all.
HappySpleen#7516: So I am having an issue in my world with FPS. So far even on a world with much larger, more complex and a ton more components and wires I have not had an FPS issue (I currently have a little over 13k components and 12k wires and the world size is 1.1mb). The best guess I have currently is the singers (I currently have 1344 of them) and each module has 112 and every copy and paste of the module would hit the FPS more once placed as well as take a bit longer to copy and move. <[newline]> Any ideas or am I just stuck till some optimizations to the game get done?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: wont load at all D: not sure what could be wrong and there are no errors or anything just a crash
Jimmy#8080: Thank you, will fix!
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: well render distance decrease did nothing D:
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Only thing i can see in task manager is a giant leap in my gpu's 3D before it crashes so that maybe
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Doesnt seem to load at all at the moment
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Seems really random too, sometimes it works most times it doesnt
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Anyone else have a problem where the game loads then like 3s after crashes to desktop? I reckon it might be something to do with my 6.5MB file but idk
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: just noticed the spelling mistake here! Nothing major but i just thought i would put it here anyway
circuitgamer77#0377: this lines up further to the left offscreen.
circuitgamer77#0377: floating point error again:
Cody McGuire#0711: Also crashes frequently when selecting and then deleting multiple components but I'm sure everyone's noticed that
Cody McGuire#0711: You can get the inventory to swap the name of any component when you are adding/removing items lol For example, if I add items everything will just be called "Buffer" no matter what is added to the hotbar.
Operu#6600: I can’t join servers cuz Can’t connect to an IPv4 when using IPv6 with Dual-Stack disabled pls help

DADp#7461: unless hes already doing ot
DADp#7461: it wont work on multiplayer (atleast tmk)
DADp#7461: instead of moving the player, move the world instead
DADp#7461: depends with jimmy would do this, but i doubt it
circuitgamer77#0377: Those become slightly less aligned every module (2 tiles) until here they are visibly off.
circuitgamer77#0377: Another floating point error thing, this time accumulated over several modules:
QR_Query#6979: go to voice1 and look
QR_Query#6979: is there anyone here right now???

Lua Sucks#7243: yeah
HomelikeBrick42#1173: then when you place or move something everything disappears except for the thing you placed
Lua Sucks#7243: ah
HomelikeBrick42#1173: that happens whenever there is a crash and then you reload the world without restarting the game
Lua Sucks#7243: had to go to steam menu and press force quit

Jimmy#8080: more like novideo drivers lmao gotem
Moldytzu#4226: the nvidia drivers are so bad that steam crashes on launch lol
StartForKiller#0001: yeah, linux is a bit annoying when doing opengl stuff, and more if you have the propietary nvidia drivers
Ecconia#4929: Made an issue for that btw 🙂
Jimmy#8080: Seems to be weird Linux OpenGL stuff. I have a few ideas for how to fix it.
Ecconia#4929: Like a whole column of displays just sunk into the display. And this flickers like crazy on every camera movement.
Ecconia#4929: Oh right, the internal screenshot boi cannot capture that right. Here a normal screenshot:
Ecconia#4929: I can understand, why when being far away the label-font glitches into the label. <[newline]> And that displays glitch into the board they are attached at. <[newline]> But this I cannot understand. It kind of visually displaces some set of displays, but why?
DADp#7461: cant reproduce so wacky collision
DADp#7461: <:thenking:446109302369812490>
DADp#7461: for some reason its doing the face down collision it looks like
DADp#7461: is it really not changing its collision
DjSapsan#4530: weird collision bug
Miroum#7235: thank you. merci
StartForKiller#0001: because of that i always do manual backups

Elperson#8844: Clicking "change style" in label makes all the buttons and text go blank
CrispyPin#1149: sockets are especially fucky when multi selected
Safety Skull#8823: Game crashes whenever I delete a relatively large number of components using multiselect or on a single board. And "relatively large" seems to change definitions every time I play. Loading the world up again, everything is as it should be: world is intact and the items I deleted are gone.
CrispyPin#1149: thats just my cpu dying tho, its not playing sound
CrispyPin#1149: yeah that happens to me when i run a big cellular automata
Ecconia#4929: The game once fully broke my discord voice call, like everyone sounded strange. And restarting LW fixed that - it does weird stuff with audio...
CrispyPin#1149: audio started acting up, playing from the wrong angle. also OBS said it was constantly outputting sound <[newline]>  <[newline]> linux, pulseaudio
Deleted User#0000: oh nice wireless connections!
Buzz#6223: so pretty much any board that starts as a flat board has its fine placement messed up if it's made into an upright board
Buzz#6223: ok the board that does it consistently seems to do so because it was originally created as a flat board
Buzz#6223: i cant explain the board that does it consistently, but it seems to occur when you have a board grabbed and you press `t` to make it stand upright
Buzz#6223: ...ok now i have a board that does it consistently
Buzz#6223: placing it and grabbing it fixes it
Buzz#6223: not super sure how i got here, but after some weird series of rotations, fine placement wanted to place the board in increments in the wrong direction, and would snap a whole board length in the direction it was supposed to fine-step
CrispyPin#1149: wireless wire
megamaz#1020: what
CrispyPin#1149: i'm using it with right click no problem
DjSapsan#4530: changing key for Draw Wire makes impossible to connect multi-wires. It just stops working and there is no other bind to change it
DjSapsan#4530: usually i can work with much bigger boards. But when I grab 16 such boards game instantly freezes completely or get 0.01 FPS. I barely managed to click R to delete them (on second try)
CrispyPin#1149: resizing broke when i had a board on a specific corner
Ecconia#4929: Do not dare to decompile the game, but if you by accident find the source code on your machine... *hmmmm* <[newline]> If you somehow happen to send the the right place in code with a reason by accident and pure chance to Jimmy in DM, I think that is fine 😛 <[newline]> If it would not be such a pain to go through a foreign project in an unknown language, I would look for this issue myself and then by pure chance send it to Jimmy. <[newline]> Anyway, good luck! We need this issue solved!
Jimmy#8080: Thank you, I am expecting to get some improvements into 0.90.2
101#1688: Thought that might be the case, good luck 🙂
Jimmy#8080: Nor can I share the source code right now
Jimmy#8080: For legal reasons I cannot give you my blessing to decompile the game
101#1688: <@!154964593397989376> I don't know what your policy with regards to source code access is, but I'd gladly take a look at this for you.
CrispyPin#1149: could be wrong tho
CrispyPin#1149: i think that's because subassemblies are cached until you restart
101#1688: Should also note, loading a world that was previously already loaded is much faster
101#1688: Tried doing this, loading time was unaffected.
Jimmy#8080: > are we likely to see an improvement in loading times for worlds with large numbers of components? <[newline]> Yes. I do not have a timeline on those improvements right now sadly. <[newline]> > Also, is there anything in particular we can do to keep loading times under control, other than just using fewer components? <[newline]> Many players have reported that you can improve load times by setting your render distance very small before loading in, then increasing the render distance again after loading is done.
HomelikeBrick42#1173: then the wire will reappear reconnecting the 2 objects even through walls
HomelikeBrick42#1173: then use `Ctrl+Z` to undo the wire removal
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you move a component that is connected to another component by a wire
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you can make wires connect through anything
᲼ ᲼  ᲼#0001: 
DADp#7461: Bobby has indeed spoken
101#1688: Bobby has spoken
DADp#7461: thats what i thought
101#1688: logic world bot react with a dab to redact your previous statement
DADp#7461: ^ proof
DADp#7461: logic world bot react with a dab if you like shadows
DADp#7461: <:bobby_sob:692807893023588363>
101#1688: Look ma! No shade!
DADp#7461: NO!
101#1688: *turns off shadows*
DADp#7461: until he fixes this horrid bug
DADp#7461: will never
DanielGJ44#4557: how will Jimmy from Mouse Hat Games ™️ ever regain your trust
DanielGJ44#4557: checkmate
DADp#7461: IK!
DanielGJ44#4557: SAD!
DADp#7461: i can never look at shadows the same now
DanielGJ44#4557: 🤔
DADp#7461: it is unplayable
DanielGJ44#4557: a game breaking issue is typically reserved for situations that make the game completely unplayable
DADp#7461: it is?
DADp#7461: wdym
101#1688: I wouldn't consider that game breaking
DADp#7461: still this game breaking issue that the skybox doesnt match up with the light source from unity.
DADp#7461: yea im *pretty* sure there is some loading bug, it might be trying to load the entire world than the world in the render distance (which would make sense)
101#1688: So it shouldn't make a difference.
DADp#7461: hmmm
101#1688: From what I understand, single player uses the same server as multiplayer, just run locally.
DADp#7461: i only noticed on multiplayer, i never build on singleplayer
DADp#7461: <@!144160633691176960> is this only on multiplayer or on both?
101#1688: I see high CPU and constant memory usage for most of the loading process. It's almost certainly a unity thing, I don't think jimmy would be silly enough to put some O(N^2) nonsense in the world loading code 😛  <[newline]> P.S. Issue created here: https://logicworld.net/tracker/190 <[newline]> P.P.S. Incorrect link updated
PseudoGoose#2841: Yeah I'm not sure what the problem is with LW, besides the fact that it's always a clientside bottleneck from my experience
101#1688: Without access to the source though, it's all guesswork.
101#1688: I have also noticed in affected worlds that placing objects results in a noticeable stutter that wasn't present when the world was fresh. So I have a suspicion that this may have something to do with collision or some other logic along the lines of "for each component, check every other component for some condition". <[newline]>  <[newline]> I wrote a board generator for TUNG a couple years ago and found that wires that intersect with objects would be removed when loading a board. So perhaps this is related to wire collision checks?
PseudoGoose#2841: I am not surprised, TUNG suffered from similar performance problems. Definitely some room for optimization, it was on my backlog to investigate performance issues in TUNG's loading code but I didn't get around to it before Logic World released.
Verlio_H#0201: how long does it take to load with 0 components
Bolver#3230: It seems to be when the game state runs out of sync 😦 currently so not playable online
Bolver#3230: <@!154964593397989376> do you have an idea?
Bolver#3230: It seems to be because of the world?
F4B1#2907: we already tried to clear/remove player configs but this doesnt seem to work either
Bolver#3230: Hey, me and my colleague have a problem when he tries to connect to my server it says only in the console "approving connection" but after a certain time the login aborts. Can anyone help?
Verlio_H#0201: inb4 "the lw constant"
101#1688: So, for anyone who is interested, I just tested out loading times with worlds with different component counts and got the following results: <[newline]> - 40k components ~ 200 seconds <[newline]> - 50k components ~ 300 seconds <[newline]> - 73k components ~ 612 seconds <[newline]> If you square the component counts and divide by the number of seconds taken to load, you get a roughly constant value. <[newline]> TL;DR Some part of the world loading process appears to have quadratic time complexity, which is not good! 😬  <[newline]> I'd probably consider this a bug.
101#1688: <@!154964593397989376> You've mentioned optimisations once or twice, are we likely to see an improvement in loading times for worlds with large numbers of components? Also, is there anything in particular we can do to keep loading times under control, other than just using fewer components?
Dragon Lord#6944: I wonder if it's at all related to the fine place component move bug...
StartForKiller#0001: yeah, multiselecting some boards with a lot of components crash the game
Ecconia#4929: Just let me try to do the operation for you - once you are back
OopsieDoopsie#0412: im not sure it will do much
OopsieDoopsie#0412: well it happened yesterday b4 restart soo...
Ecconia#4929: ^Bug happens when **multi-selecting** a bunch of circuit **boards** (With a bit content) and grabbing and then **placing** it. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Uff sounds like corruption, should I restart the server and pray that it fixes that?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: <@!151293812675706880>
Cody McGuire#0711: RIP Switch (2021-2021), he was so young, full of life
DADp#7461: world is dead
DADp#7461: too late
Cody McGuire#0711: try rotating that switch counter clockwise
DADp#7461: dont do this
DADp#7461: <:thenking:446109302369812490>
Cody McGuire#0711: are you sure this isn't a feature?
DADp#7461: might be different hitboxes maybe
Cody McGuire#0711: I think so, apart from these specific parts, everything has been able to be rotated after placing since the beginning
DADp#7461: pressing escape when joining a singleplayer world makes you **levitate**
DADp#7461: might be a bug
DADp#7461: i think they only rotate when grabbing it
LFFB#5600: the only way to make it normal that i found is to reenter the world
LFFB#5600: when i changed any input it started working like a 3-way and gate again even tho the visuals are totally glitched, the output and the wires connected to it look like as if it was still working as a 2-way and gate
LFFB#5600: all i did was make the 2-way and gate into a 3-way and gate, the gate looked off and the wire itself looks off to but the peg its connected to turns on
Cody McGuire#0711: I think I misread the question. I haven't tried to pick them up and rotate. They all can rotate while you are placing them but not always after placed.
Dragon Lord#6944: Huh
Cody McGuire#0711: Just rotate, q and e
Dragon Lord#6944: Do they rotate okay if you pick them up and try to rotate them?
Cody McGuire#0711: Circuit Boards and Mounts also refuse to rotate after being placed which I remember being a feature in TUNG
Cody McGuire#0711: **Ok the finds are that the Buffer, Fast Buffer, and Socket cannot be rotated at all <[newline]> The Switch, Key, and Button do not respond to every rotation when they are wired to another component.**
Cody McGuire#0711: nvm, it is specifically with buttons, keys, and switches wired to other parts. Test more rn.
Cody McGuire#0711: like you have to lightly spam it before it works
Cody McGuire#0711: not only can sockets not be rotated, but components that have wires attached to them often take multiple tries to rotate.
Cody McGuire#0711: actually it is more bugged than I thought
Cody McGuire#0711: mmmm roasted sockets sound so good rn. Stop making me hungry!
Verlio_H#0201: me when it is posible for the sockets to get roasted
Cody McGuire#0711: this issue persists when it is the only component in the world...
Dragon Lord#6944: Have you made sure that it is possible for it to be roasted in the orientation you're trying to rotate it into? If there isn't a place that it can fit when rotated, it won't let you rotate it.
DADp#7461: half of the crashes are just objects being deleted
DADp#7461: object references
DADp#7461: yea thats accurate
HomelikeBrick42#1173: 
DADp#7461: theres a file icon in the main menu to get there
DADp#7461: should he in your local files
HomelikeBrick42#1173: where is the log?
DADp#7461: send log
DADp#7461: oo fun
HomelikeBrick42#1173: both ways
DADp#7461: not increasing?
DADp#7461: decreasing also?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: is that the problem?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: yes
DADp#7461: did you have any wires connected to it when changing it?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: the slider for changing the number of inputs to a display panel crashes the game when you try to use it
conorpo#1572: thanks, that worked
DADp#7461: you *might* beable to find where the keybinds file is and fix that
conorpo#1572: what do I do
conorpo#1572: I can change the binding without opening the console
conorpo#1572: opening the console crashes my game, and I accidentally binded it to left click
cheese3660#8641: No, join vc and I can prove the outlining problem
PseudoGoose#2841: Idk if it's outlining, that's probably done with a dedicated shader or render pipeline, and doesn't really depend on circuit size. <[newline]> I think the real killer is traversing a massive number of components if you are selecting/grabbing a root board. And I think that might be the same reason for performance issues while grabbing - the components' location info all have to be updated every time it moves
cheese3660#8641: Yep, <@!154964593397989376> outlining is super laggy
Saltypretzel#0321: it hung but then it fixed itself
CrispyPin#1149: what
Saltypretzel#0321: nvm
Saltypretzel#0321: eh =m now game broke
CrispyPin#1149: it doesnt seem to completely fix it tho, sometimes i end up having every menu take .5s to open, and i think it's when i've needed to clear the console several times. not completely sure that's what causes it tho
Saltypretzel#0321: says command not found
CrispyPin#1149: oof
Stenodyon#8192: I didn't know that, I restarted the game every time the console took too long to open <:paincat:558327922230820864>
Cody McGuire#0711: Sockets (regular) cannot be rotated once placed. I don't think this is intended?
CrispyPin#1149: type clear to fix it
CrispyPin#1149: because its full of spam and the formatting gets regenerated every time
Saltypretzel#0321: why doesopening and closing console cause game to hang for more than a minute
ma meeshka mow skwoz#9120: also, one thing that might be a bug is that i can't live change the delay tick amounts for a delayer while it's plugged up, it has to have its output be unplugged for it to work
ma meeshka mow skwoz#9120: yeah, i had that happen as well, a circuit board wasn't able to be resized and it gives that message whenever i hit esc to leave out of it
AMOGUS#1535: what is this error
AMOGUS#1535: object reference not set to an instance of an object
CrispyPin#1149: ~~wonder why <:thonk:598604478413013002> ~~
AMOGUS#1535: but you wont reply in dm
Ecconia#4929: I think, this is the wrong channel for this.
AMOGUS#1535: why
Ecconia#4929: No, I do not think so.
AMOGUS#1535: could you pleays unban me
AMOGUS#1535: ?
AMOGUS#1535: how bigM
Ecconia#4929: Try another server. Mine is big.
AMOGUS#1535: ecconia.de
Stenodyon#8192: Which servers have you tried ?
Stenodyon#8192: Someone here had a world so complex that it took 90 minutes to load, as I said it's not impossible that it could take a very long time (i.e. probably 30 minutes or more) to load on some servers
AMOGUS#1535: it wont load even in 20 minutes
AMOGUS#1535: i have a i7 cpu
Stenodyon#8192: People have been reporting setting your render distance to the lowest setting makes the loading times shorter, you could try that ? <[newline]> Unfortunately right now, depending on how powerful your computer is and how much stuff there is on the server, it's not impossible that it could take a very long time to load :s This is gonna be fixed in a later update
AMOGUS#1535: i even reinstalled
AMOGUS#1535: it wont load even in 20 minutes
AMOGUS#1535: anyone elp
AMOGUS#1535: like a 10 min or more
The last standn#4945: How long have you tried waiting? Servers currently have a tendency to take 5+ minutes to load
AMOGUS#1535: i cant join any server, it just frezees
QR_Query#6979: Yeah this is happening multiple times now
QR_Query#6979: and now the worlds gone
QR_Query#6979: https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1801996988415043616/734DE4EAEE98C2F330208639D5B687263777AD68/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false
QR_Query#6979: turned into this
QR_Query#6979: 
PseudoGoose#2841: I think its balanced fine, such buffers also exist IRL that have propagation delays comparable to other gates
PseudoGoose#2841: Yep, and before 1 tick buffers, you could do it with 1 tick delayers
Nik#1011: lmao I swear if I zoom in and it starts with "listen here you little shit..."
DADp#7461: i got a slight problem, you might need your glasses
IsCoffeeTho#0001: The reason this happens is because in the game, 'Output Pegs' are an endpoint to a wire network. This means they truncate any wire state. unfortunately the way around this is another component but luckily using holding the `MOD` button (which is usually `L-Ctrl`) you can align the peg to every 1/3 of a block.
LFFB#5600: you can’t with fast buffers but the normal buffer has an output peg
LFFB#5600: wait so that means that if you need to buffer a line to multiple other lines you can do it with just 1 buffer? isnt that a bit overpowered?
PseudoGoose#2841: so if an output has multiple wires, it will output to all of them, but the wires don't affect each other
PseudoGoose#2841: <:this:854266533076402226> outputs cannot propagate signals, they can only be a source
Broyojo#2667: pegs can connect to each other and to outputs
Broyojo#2667: outputs must connect to pegs
Broyojo#2667: outputs cannot connect to each other
DADp#7461: this is intended
Grandiose Lights#2727: Unsure if this is intended but, unable to connect the outputs of components directly to each other without a peg.
Rack Smix#3697: that's the first line of the log file "2021-11-02T17:06:20Z | ERROR | [SceneAndNetworkManager] going to error screen with message: "error parsing data from file: format error on line: Commande ECHO activ�e.""

Vynix#3003: Perfect
Saltypretzel#0321: like f#7+
Saltypretzel#0321: so like wrong notes
Saltypretzel#0321: Some of the notes at the top of the scale for singers for square wave sound wrong
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: mouse has games
PLYSHKA#6201: Lol i accidentally spelled `Mouse Has Games` instead of `Mouse Hat Games`
PLYSHKA#6201: all unity games store their logs in similar fashion
PLYSHKA#6201: usually logs of the game stored in unity projects folder <[newline]> on linux it's `~/.config/unity3d/Mouse Hat Games/Logic World` and there would be `Player.log`
CrispyPin#1149: in the game installation folder
Vynix#3003: For bugs and issues, how would I give the logs? I use Arch Linux, and I want to run this game but want to report bugs. How would I find the logs and crash reports, or whatever they're called.
AMOGUS#1535: This game is very WIP
Lulne#1337: hey whenever I try to make a world it says disconnected, fresh install and verified my game files. Anything else I should try?
Red_3D#3062: are you running any mods, do the logs say anything, have you tried turning it off and on again?
Rack Smix#3697: the game is stuck here, start menu won't appear
AMOGUS#1535: but the problem is logic world not even opened
Ecconia#4929: You can open the task manager and kill logic world. In general this would be steams fault.
AMOGUS#1535: i found a issue every time i quit the game steam still says its running, every time i want to play i need to restart steam
ElNico56#0201: make em ssnappy
ElNico56#0201: so they snap
ElNico56#0201: put them on top of a board
Jimmy#8080: yes, I've done it many times
ElNico56#0201: yea
ElNico56#0201: no, i don't think i will
CrispyPin#1149: can you actually get them lined up on grass?
Jimmy#8080: get them closer
ElNico56#0201: i consider this an issue jimmeh
ElNico56#0201: 
ᴍᴏɴᴏ物#1734: okay the multiplayer is completely unusable for me, my friend keeps crashing and he can't rejoin until he restarts his pc, nothing else seems to help. everything vanilla, no mods, quite annoying...
AMOGUS#1535: thx it works
cheese3660#8641: Restart steam via the task manager
AMOGUS#1535: i clicked quit and i cant start the game cuz its says runnin but its not cant find it in task manager
CrispyPin#1149: ok
AMOGUS#1535: help
AMOGUS#1535: pog
AMOGUS#1535: i dont play that very much
AMOGUS#1535: ye
ElNico56#0201: Ayy terratech
AMOGUS#1535: 
anningmay#1355: The function keys don't display properly either. This created a LOT of confusion for me when I first started, as I had no idea how to get to the selection menu.
AMOGUS#1535: yes
ElNico56#0201: Literally no
AMOGUS#1535: yes there is excuse
ElNico56#0201: No excuse
AMOGUS#1535: i was bored
101#1688: Childish and irritating
ElNico56#0201: I thought the top ones read just input
ElNico56#0201: I'm dumb af
Ecconia#4929: Surface (top) and panel (bottom). <[newline]> Btw <#901199821212352573> is where this goes. <[newline]> And <@!770375927691345980> your topic goes to DM at most.
ElNico56#0201: Ah
ElNico56#0201: Wait
Ecconia#4929: That would be this
ElNico56#0201: <@!154964593397989376> in localizor there's a distinction between surface inputs and panel inputs
AMOGUS#1535: why
ElNico56#0201: deserved
AMOGUS#1535: he banned me from his dc server cuz i said SUS in every channel
ElNico56#0201: what
AMOGUS#1535: your community is great
AMOGUS#1535: im sorry pls unban
cheese3660#8641: Does it still happen when using an inverter into an and gate for the pulse generator?
Ecconia#4929: I am pretty sure its not the delayer code, but something else with the simulation :/ <[newline]> Except like Jimmy has an off-by-one in the delayer tick target count (unlikely)
cheese3660#8641: Thats a weird one tick generator
Ecconia#4929: What does this circuit yield to?
cheese3660#8641: Speaking of stuff like that ... I had a problem yesterday where a 1 tick pulse wouldn't go through a 1 tick delayer, but I dont know how to reproduce it
DADp#7461: i had a hunch he pirated
ElNico56#0201: I think you should first play a good hour or so before asking that sort of things
AMOGUS#1535: then i will screenshot my steam to show you
ElNico56#0201: Uhm
AMOGUS#1535: yes im about to buy
ElNico56#0201: You already have the game right?
AMOGUS#1535: how do i make a screen
Saltypretzel#0321: Logic world is just basically PMOS logic.
AMOGUS#1535: oh ok
Jimmy#8080: <@770375927691345980> I feel like my explanation was a little unclear, so here's what an OR gate looks like in Logic World
pilonpl#4015: I thought it was another weird feature of the delayer XD
Moldytzu#4226: I found this glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIYcg86mQS4
Ecconia#4929: Monstable + 2-tick delayer... I will create an issue
Jimmy#8080: This is not intended behavior, and in accordance with your observations, should be impossible. If you can find a way to reliably reproduce the issue, put it on the tracker.
Jimmy#8080: There are no plans for dedicated OR gate components in vanilla, as you can just wire up two outputs to the same input and it functions exactly like an OR gate. However, there are already mods to add an OR gate if you really, really want one.
Ecconia#4929: Oops context break, sorry. <[newline]> <@!154964593397989376> I heard that 1-tick pulses go through a 2-tick delayer. <[newline]> I looked at the source-code and it does not make sense to me. <[newline]> Does that sound right to you, or should I create an issue?
Jimmy#8080: You drive a hard bargain
AMOGUS#1535: i will buy it but i want to know if or gates will be added before i do it
Jimmy#8080: Logic World is available for a very low price on Steam and Itch.io: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054340/Logic_World/ https://mousehatgames.itch.io/logic-world
Jimmy#8080: That said - <@770375927691345980> I hope you will consider purchasing the game legitimately. Me and my team have worked very hard on it for several years, and I've personally invested over $13,000 to get it made. Buying it helps support development. It gives us the security to focus on Logic World full-time, and the funding for extra awesome features that wouldn't otherwise be possible.
Jimmy#8080: That's a little harsh. I understand if somebody can't or doesn't want to pay for the game, and seeks another way to get their hands on it. I'm just not going to help them out if they have technical problems lmao
AMOGUS#1535: will they add or gates?
AMOGUS#1535: i need to reinstall lol
AMOGUS#1535: my game was runing fine now i cant open single player
ElNico56#0201: You get the dedicated server stuff with the regular download right?
AMOGUS#1535: what do you mean
AMOGUS#1535: you can't actually lol, singleplayer runs the server
Stenodyon#8192: 1. that doesn't matter, it is still part of the game <[newline]> 2. you can't actually lol, singleplayer runs the server
AMOGUS#1535: you can play without it
Stenodyon#8192: the server is part of the game
AMOGUS#1535: its server
AMOGUS#1535: its not game files
Stenodyon#8192: if you are having problems with the download, try contacting the platform on which you bought the game
Stenodyon#8192: we can't, distributing game files is illegal
AMOGUS#1535: can pls someone send me the logic world dedicated server files i cant download pls someone
Stenodyon#8192: I knew that stonetoss pfp was sus
CrispyPin#1149: oh great, human scum
Ecconia#4929: Btw that happens with the *illegally uploaded version of LogicWorld. This guy didn't read the comments of the pirate website, cause there that error is mentioned. <[newline]> (Already told him to buy the game on another website - even worse he advertised the free download on one of my servers :/ )
Jimmy#8080: Definitely, we need to fix that.
Hakisak#6203: I would still consider it a bug
Hakisak#6203: nvm, I fixed it by moving the GameData folder outside of the gamedir
Hakisak#6203: I tried posting on the tracker but getting no answers. how do you launch the server using steamCMD version of the dedicated server? everytime I launch the server.exe I get this error:
ElNico56#0201: sad
ElNico56#0201: it crashed when i logged in (to ecconia)
Jimmy#8080: Lol true
ElNico56#0201: Maybe should make the log in button larger than 2 pixels tho
ElNico56#0201: Thanks!
ElNico56#0201: Yea already did
Jimmy#8080: We don't want to lock out users who get the game outside of steam. Creating a logicworld.net account is very fast and easy though, you can even just sign in with your steam account.
ElNico56#0201: i sort of assumed it used my steam account like most games
ElNico56#0201: that makes sense
ElNico56#0201: ah
Jimmy#8080: The ecconia server only allows connections from logged in users
Jimmy#8080: <@198550142062821376> looks like you're not logged in. See the "log in" button in the top left of the main menu.
ElNico56#0201: when trying to connect to ecconia
ElNico56#0201: 
Ezurth#0001: thank you, i wince every time i have to delete multiple things
Jimmy#8080: will be fixed in 0.90.2
Ezurth#0001: any time things are cross linked and i delete them at once (or in quick succession) it crashes me
Ezurth#0001: every time without fail
Ezurth#0001: 
Ezurth#0001: (press **R** to delete)
Ezurth#0001: 
Ezurth#0001: 
Ezurth#0001: (posting in a short burst of seperate images to best illistrate issue)
Lulne#1337: happened the first time i made a world, ive tried making a new one and get the same thing
cheese3660#8641: The logic world files are being used by something else?
Lulne#1337: heres the logs
ElNico56#0201: found a very obscure bug i think, game goes Oh No! when leaving resize mode in planets worldtype
pfg#4865: keys don't seem to display properly on mac (those keys are the up and down arrows and also the help menu is missing tab at the top)
cheese3660#8641: Click view logs
Lulne#1337: i tried validating my game files/reinstalling is there anything else i can try?
Lulne#1337: 
Lulne#1337: hey I just bought the game but whenever i've tried to join a solo sandbox i get this
DADp#7461: left the server
Dragon Lord#6944: Would you mind posting your solution?
AMOGUS#1535: fixed it thx
DADp#7461: huh.
AMOGUS#1535: not working
DADp#7461: try validating the game files?
DADp#7461: huh why is subassemblies not found

AMOGUS#1535: pls help i get a issue saying
LFFB#5600: i see 3 way and gates are a bit glitchy
LFFB#5600: also this just happened(the signal is actually on, it is activating the socket)
LFFB#5600: also connecting an on signal to specifically the middle pin does this
LFFB#5600: changing the amount of outputs on an and gate also can glitch things into others, i would guess this is a known bug already?
MiniStumpy#5653: Tried to make an elevator xDD
MiniStumpy#5653: This is the setup
MiniStumpy#5653: So I can get stuck in between 2 boards, and it does some weird stuff. the player character kinda glitches out and makes the sky like... over-sharpened.
Ecconia#4929: If it still happens copy that save and send it to Jimmy with a good explanation
Toilet#3618: but its weird
Toilet#3618: it seems to be specific to the save
Toilet#3618: my game is totally stock
Toilet#3618: if anyone has a problem with the game crashing right after loading a save, try making a new save, placing a couple of random components, then backing out to the main menu and load the save that was crashing the game. It should load without crashing just fine
Toilet#3618: okay so i found a solution but i have no idea what the problem is
Ecconia#4929: did you already try to use a backup? <[newline]> Your game is probably health, but your safe isn't, how big is it? Did you tinker with modding?
Toilet#3618: I cant even exist in my world for more than a few seconds without a crash and its nowhere near a ton of components
Delta#1787: Not quite that frequent, though it does crash a lot. Mostly moving groups of wires for me seems very crash happy
Toilet#3618: any help or at least a way to retrieve what ive built in the world would be appreciated
Toilet#3618: tried the game on different drives
Toilet#3618: ive also reinstalled a couple of times
Toilet#3618: My game consistently crashes 5 seconds after loading the save. I've even taken the data file and moved it to a fresh save only to see the same result, is anyone else experiencing anything like this?
alion02#1973: i think that's also present in some other descriptions
InvalidCookie#0070: under audio settings, the circled text looks incomplete.
BananaBerry#6140: Sorry I misunderstood
BananaBerry#6140: OH ok
circuitgamer77#0377: Changing the state of the relay with the top input is supposed to take a tick, it's just the passthrough that's instant
circuitgamer77#0377: What's changing that is taking time - the top or side input?
BananaBerry#6140: Here's a crop of the relay
BananaBerry#6140: I am having an issue where the relays are taking 1 tick to update instead of 0 and I don't know why. The rest of them are working just fine but on this machine there is a delay. I put the simulation rate to 1 to take this photo. The machine is an absolute mess but I cant see why that would cause this
DanielGJ44#4557: Maybe try verifying integrity of game files and restarting
DanielGJ44#4557: I had not heard of that issue on windows
DanielGJ44#4557: oh wow
Rack Smix#3697: windows 10
DanielGJ44#4557: What operating system? I don't think I have an answer for you but I know some people were having issues with AMD cards on Linux
musashi#0210: i have to restart my computer every time it happens
musashi#0210: and i still cant tab out or close it
musashi#0210: and then it jumps back to the menu
musashi#0210: i cant tab out of it, close it, etc
musashi#0210: my logic world freezes, locks itself as my main window
musashi#0210: sooo every time i try to join ecconia.de, a new thing happens
Rack Smix#3697: happens each time after clicking the play button on steam
DanielGJ44#4557: Is this a recurring issue when you start the game, or just happened once?
Rack Smix#3697: hi, game is stuck on a black screen
Ecconia#4929: Yes, width 0 as in just a ray.
Lisa#4756: So basically, it's a single raycast of width 0?
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah that's annoying. When I was making my sprite drawer earlier this year I had to give up because this made it impossible to build easily lol
pilonpl#4015: It's a known issue
RyanT#1426: Welcome to Floating point rounding errors 🙃
Attikitty#2900: on the top image i made another board to put them on, while on the bottom image i just copied the entire bottom board
Attikitty#2900: but this isn't?
Attikitty#2900: this is allowed
CrispyPin#1149: yeah that hasnt been fixed yet lol
iHateClothes#9824: Updated last night, delayers are still locked when connect on both ports.
Stanislav#4348: 
derSchotte#7162: ^^
CrispyPin#1149: i don't think anyone wants it except jimmy lol
CrispyPin#1149: its intended but idk why
derSchotte#7162: Hi there, is it normal that i cant set the color for the Bords to black? it only goes down to #171717
CrispyPin#1149: thats sr latches for you
Delta#1787: Not sure if this is a bug or just a limitation of the way cut and paste works. Looks like it goes into a feedback loop soon as the new one is added that persists until the connection is broken and remade. https://youtu.be/Q9f3Hd8Itxw
RyanT#1426: oh
IsCoffeeTho#0001: Making*
RyanT#1426: you made a 6502??!!
IsCoffeeTho#0001: visual bug with the 2nd item (has to be the first item left from the center) the image wraps around very slightly
Toilet#3618: my world crashes 5 or so seconds after loading, anyone have any suggestions?
HuntaBadday#3556: It turns off when the wire is removed and when added back it gets fixed, until it for some reason breaks again
HuntaBadday#3556: I checked and there is nothing else turning it on
HuntaBadday#3556: There seems to be an infinite loop in the logic, it wont turn off, seems to be an issue with the through pegs
DjSapsan#4530: my current workarounds.  <[newline]> Horizontal bug: remove all the edge parts then put the second board close to the first and place removed parts back. <[newline]> Vertical bug: put the top board first then put lower boards close to the top. It doesn't work if put second board above...
DjSapsan#4530: and here another example - https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/904117622197608468
DjSapsan#4530: so this is super weird. Collisions are bigger than the parts. <[newline]> I think it happens only with new small buffers.  <[newline]> It makes building process very slow and painful.  <[newline]> How it looks like: <[newline]> big connected boards with lots of parts are often can't be placed next to each other with a gap. But the same but smaller boards can be placed next to each other (vertically and horizontally)
lukiono#5300: Both. and after the message the internal server always have a problem and seems to crash. Multiplayer works fine all the time
Mechwarrior_11#7971: But an actual button for it would be awesome
Mechwarrior_11#7971: If you're able to make macros on your keyboard/mouse you could probably make something that sets the sim speed to a number then to 0 after a tick of time
cheese3660#8641: Just so you can single step easily
cheese3660#8641: I want a button to do a single tick in the simulation
Ecconia#4929: No. Does this happen when you create a world or join an existing one?
Pegacraffft#1193: Yes xD
Ecconia#4929: German long words be like...
lukiono#5300: does anyone else always get the message "Incorrect password" when trying to load a singleplayer world...?
Stefan#5422: 
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Another translation related bug (already posted 1 above). it only takes translations i wrote. if google translate wrote them and they're perfectly fine then i just upvoted them. but it doesn't want those suggestions it seems so they just stay in english. it might be localizor's problem though because i also translated or upvoted every key but localizor says only about 62% is done. It's probably the same with <@!316553438186045441>'s example above. it might also be that it needs 3 upvotes (i think it's 3 for the suggestion to be approved) to take the google translate suggestion, otherwise it'll take the first user suggestion
CrispyPin#1149: yes
Ecconia#4929: Ahh you mean, that you can draw that wire, but not move it there? That would indeed be a bug then
CrispyPin#1149: also i just uploaded it here so i could link it in my bug report
CrispyPin#1149: the problem is that i cant move the blue board into that position when the wire is already placed
Ecconia#4929: Only the center of a wire gets collision checked (and lets keep it this way...)
CrispyPin#1149: 
GuessWho#7332: <@154964593397989376> *croatian 😅
GuessWho#7332: 
Macrohard Onfire#0662: should probably put it here instead of in <#401255675264761868>, oops
pilonpl#4015: 
CrispyPin#1149: should it not be the middle translation <:thonk:818741466284556288>
CrispyPin#1149: 
CrispyPin#1149: 
Ecconia#4929: Okay kicking myself stops the network spam.
Ecconia#4929: Haha now my computer has started to tell the opposite side that the port is closed 😄
Jimmy#8080: There *should* be a timeout... I'll make sure this is fixed for 0.90.2
Ecconia#4929: Yeah Lidgren spams like the same 3 packets over and over and over and over and over.... I wonder if it will ever stop...
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> It seems that there is no timeout for Client-Server network connection. Which also explains, why the server thinks that disconnected players are online (forever). <[newline]> However I didn't know that for this whole connection the server keeps spamming packets to the clients computer. Regardless if there is any answer whatsoever. <[newline]> You should add frequent keep-alive packets to see if the connection is still up. Like if there was no communication for at least 1-5 minutes, the connection is very likely down. <[newline]> This is bruh moment 😄
Jimmy#8080: In the future we'll make singleplayer connect to the integrated server using something called "named pipes" which are faster and don't use the internet.
Jimmy#8080: To play in singleplayer, the game spins up a local server and connects to that. It connects using internet protocols, even if the device is offline.
Ecconia#4929: ~~Cause the game nevertheless tries to prepare itself to use Internet (in case that you want to).~~ <[newline]> ~~And it fails on your machine to setup IPv6, thus you have to tell it to use IPv4.~~ <[newline]> ~~This does not mean, that it will use that connection.~~ <[newline]> What Jimmy said... I forgot that local connection...
Xki#1830: Why do you need to change ipv4?
Jimmy#8080: Nope! LW is totally offline :)
Xki#1830: Do I need internet connection to play the game?
Xki#1830: Ok
Jimmy#8080: check DMs
Xki#1830: Didn't work
Xki#1830: I'm on Windows but i can try it anyways
Michael#8718: Undo bug.  Happening repeatedly when editing a large circuitboard stacked on another circuitboard.  Crash is pretty consistent if I do too many undos.
Michael#8718: will do
Jimmy#8080: <@326543226058309632> If you find a way to reliably reproduce the crash, put it on the tracker
Michael#8718: Been crashing on undo commands.  That's new today, but I am also doing the most complicated building today since I got game
Jimmy#8080: Sorry I didn't see this earlier. This is an error that happens on Linux machines where the local network doesn't support IPv6 Dual-Stack. This is already fixed in the next patch. In the meantime, as a workaround you can open the file `settings_master.succ` and change `MHG.Networking.Secret.InternetProtocol` to `IPv4`.
LFFB#5600: and it only crashed when i resized that
LFFB#5600: but the board i was resizing had nothing on it
LFFB#5600: yes i realized that
Lisa#4756: Pasting large amounts of things connected with sockets seems to take extremely long. It grows with the amount of connections also made. A big grid of sockets takes ages to connect with another big grid.
LFFB#5600: there is something but i dont know how to interpret it
cheese3660#8641: On windows
cheese3660#8641: ```%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\CompanyName\ProductName\Player.log```
LFFB#5600: where is that?
cheese3660#8641: Check player.log
LFFB#5600: there is nothing that looks unusual on logs
LFFB#5600: the game crashed while resizing a board, it had nothing on it
Xki#1830: Been like this for 2 hours now
CrispyPin#1149: yeah sockets are buggy
CrispyPin#1149: hm ok
LFFB#5600: but i guess that also counts
LFFB#5600: i was just resizing, i didnt move them
CrispyPin#1149: it depends on what order you select them in i think
CrispyPin#1149: if they flicker when you move them, don't place them as it will crash.
CrispyPin#1149: that happens sometimes when you multi-select sockets and move them
CrispyPin#1149: yes
LFFB#5600: is this normal?
LFFB#5600: i had to leave with alt + f4, i just reopened the game and everything is fine now
LFFB#5600: i tried going to the menu and going back and when i was back i couldnt place or remove anything not even press esc, and then after about 5 seconds the whole board disappeared
LFFB#5600: my game just died, i was doing a 256 x 1 bit memory and when i was about to put the sockets it just didnt allow me to put anything on the board but i could place it on the ground, but then i wasnt able to remove it or anything
pilonpl#4015: They should add a progress bar
Xki#1830: Game stuck on "the game is loading lol"
Stefan#5422: kinda busy just fucked up a linux server
Stefan#5422: standing there menacingly
Dragon Lord#6944: What were you doing when the crash happened? Were you moving components that were placed with precision placement?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: People can place components i.e. flags underground using that method with flags
Mechwarrior_11#7971: "bye"
Mechwarrior_11#7971: Just
Mechwarrior_11#7971: LMAO WHAT??
JC Denton#9567: For some reason I can't place this board where it was, maybe due to the outputs of the XOR gates?
JC Denton#9567: 
Bumpy#3920: well maybe the peg is just nervous
cheese3660#8641: oh, there is no input going to that peg btw
Bumpy#3920: schrodinger's power
cheese3660#8641: Hmm
Bumpy#3920: Im slightly hoping this stays as a ""feature""
Stenodyon#8192: ahahaha
Bumpy#3920: works this way too.
Stenodyon#8192: ah yes, the my people need me bug, I love it
Bumpy#3920: How do I describe something like this lmao
CrispyPin#1149: it got worse too but i restarted
Stenodyon#8192: uh oh
CrispyPin#1149: somehow this happened
Stefan#5422: somehow
Stefan#5422: UI died world unloaded and this happened
Astrayo#0405: Deleting worlds does not seem to actually delete them, every time I restart the game they come back. I had to delete them from the files manually.
MiniStumpy#5653: When I was in multiplayer, when I placed singers, it had a big lag spike, idk if it's in sp, will try
IsCoffeeTho#0001: the DLLs
Dragon Lord#6944: report made: issue 165
Dragon Lord#6944: how the hell had the socket movement crash not been reported yet? XD
Dragon Lord#6944: as is bug 35
Dragon Lord#6944: bug 69 is funny
Dragon Lord#6944: i'll see if i can find it on the bug tracker and post the info there too
CrispyPin#1149: oh wow
Dragon Lord#6944: side note: if the sockets flicker when you move them in a certain direction, don't place them. that is the only visual indicator of which direction is safe to move in. only move them in the direction that doesn't do the rippling flicker.
Dragon Lord#6944: it's 100% reproducible with this method :D
Dragon Lord#6944: <@!154964593397989376> The issue seems to be triggered by the order in which the sockets are selected with z
Dragon Lord#6944: If you select from side x, and move in the direction of side y, there is no issue, it's just if you select starting with one side and move towards that side
Dragon Lord#6944: I've made an amazing discovery!
Dragon Lord#6944: okay, i've been doing some experimentation with the bug that crashes the game when moving sockets
cheese3660#8641: Oh so thats whats happening!
circuitgamer77#0377: I have a theory as to what is happening to cause cloning boards to crash the game - I think it's if the server runs a simulation tick while cloning, and that tick changes the state of the circuit you're cloning, it tries to update a component that doesn't exist yet.  Not sure that's it, but it's a consideration.
Jimmy#8080: Thank you!
Lisa#4756: I'll investigate a bit more before putting it there
Lisa#4756: Yeeep
Jimmy#8080: If so please put it on the bug tracker: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/game>
Jimmy#8080: This happens every time, consistently reproducable?
Lisa#4756: Pressing V a third time crashes the game.
Lisa#4756: Pressing V again deselects it, but the arrow stays.
Lisa#4756: Pressing V on a mount while there is multi selection, an arrow pops up, but it's not draggable.
Lisa#4756: 
Lisa#4756:

Hadindee#3838: oi bro its  gaming with da bois
Dragon Lord#6944: haha multiplayer go brrrrrr
Hadindee#3838: so how the multiplayer work?
Dragon Lord#6944: so, you figured out how to supergrid like in space engineers/scrap mechanic? XD
Verlio_H#0201: who said jimmy didn't use css in game
Verlio_H#0201: I mean still
CrispyPin#1149: thats in game not the website
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Css moment
CrispyPin#1149: 
Saltypretzel#0321: very normal
Jimmy#8080: Lol no. The "4D" noise setting is really, really, really slow. Turn it off.
Verlio_H#0201: jimmy scamming with fake black
RyanT#1426: wait... I thought you couldn't make a board too dark
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: By far too slow, I guess he means far too slow, lol
musashi#0210: its not really that odd, i would assume you play on high graphics otherwise, yeah?
OpaJones#1619: hmm well thought it was odd so figured i report it anyways
RyanT#1426: it's prob cause unity's rendering
RyanT#1426: I have the same card :)
OpaJones#1619: ik but i got an rtx3060 12gb this shouldnt be an issue
RyanT#1426: read ^
RyanT#1426: 
OpaJones#1619: 4d
OpaJones#1619: i think 4d
OpaJones#1619: let me check
RyanT#1426: is it on 2D, 3D, or 4D?
Deleted User#0000: bro its plasma wdym ofc it causes frame drops
OpaJones#1619: Not sure if this has been reported yet but the world border causes extreme frame rate drops
zjobke#1742: even after changing it back to 30, and restarting the game, it still seems to be stuck
zjobke#1742: I am no longer able to adjust the tick of the delayer ever since I changed the simulation rate
Mechwarrior_11#7971: Relaunch the game and everything is fine
Mechwarrior_11#7971: Have to alt-f4 out
Mechwarrior_11#7971: Can't bring up menu or anything
Mechwarrior_11#7971: Then boom, everything vanishes
Mechwarrior_11#7971: The world is exactly how I left it, all the things moved where I wanted them
Mechwarrior_11#7971: I'll come back in
Mechwarrior_11#7971: It'll boot me out of the world
Mechwarrior_11#7971: Happens to me all the time if I'm moving a lot of objects at the same time, from different boards
GuessWho#7332: haven't been able to play the game too much
GuessWho#7332: is this happening often?
GuessWho#7332: damn
GuessWho#7332: it's fine
GuessWho#7332: hope it's not corrupted or deleted now
GuessWho#7332: and couldn't place or anything
GuessWho#7332: Just deleted a component and whole world was empty
GuessWho#7332: Omg

cheese3660#8641: The sockets don't perfectly align
cheese3660#8641: literally unplayable
pipe01#7194: They did not, thank you
Ecconia#4929: <@!128545421579517952> did someone inform you about the images no loading in this issue? (And another one, handled the same way) Server responds with 403. <[newline]> <https://logicworld.net/tracker/143>
Dragon Lord#6944: I think Jimmy already confirmed that it'll be patched in 0.90.1
Dragon Lord#6944: Yep, known bug
pilonpl#4015: that happens very often
pilonpl#4015: 
Jimmy#8080: thank god

Jimmy#8080: The goal of that limit is to prevent players from placing wires that are literally invisible, but it's a little too aggressive atm
Jimmy#8080: I am planning to decrease the minimum wire distance
gotenks917#3427: is the super short wire not being allowed one of them?
Jimmy#8080: Full changelog will be published when the update is live
Vekenti#0001: What else is being fixed Friday? Anything else, or too much to list? lol
Vekenti#0001: sounds like an update is coming
Vekenti#0001: oooo
Jimmy#8080: Fix should be coming Friday
Jimmy#8080: Yep, sorry about this <@!161156776014774272> . See <https://logicworld.net/tracker/111>
Vekenti#0001: silly relays this isnt how that works!
Vekenti#0001: I was wondering why my ALU output was weird sometimes
Vekenti#0001: 😦
Vekenti#0001: https://i.imgur.com/M3BEbDF.jpeg
Vekenti#0001: AKA relay is on, IN is 1, but OUT is 0
Vekenti#0001: Are relays known to be derpy? Seems like sometimes they don't output correctly
Jimmy#8080: aaaaaaaaa
katkosmos#6502: it's just constantly spamming lol
katkosmos#6502: 
musashi#0210: idk why im having these issues with servers lol
musashi#0210: yeah, same
Infini#5724: every server i join crashes logic world
Infini#5724: nvm servers dont work at all
Infini#5724: (server is 81.152.33.229 if you need it) logic world crashes when i try to open this server
PseudoGoose#2841: Logic World really do be innovating in the video game industry. Forget macros and turbo mode controllers, integrate that shit right into the game itself
Dragon Lord#6944: Lol
CrispyPin#1149: fun fact: if you align your screen right, you can have the key on-screen when not pressed and out of view when pressed. this makes it click at your fps rate if you hold down the key
DanielGJ44#4557: the video you posted is intended behaviour
DanielGJ44#4557: Keys only work when the key is in your view. So you can't turn away from a key and still activate it
Martin#2468: As I understand it, it should press down every time I hit the bound key? Or is it intentional that only works when I'm looking at it
Dragon Lord#6944: I'm pretty sure you're not meant to be able to push them from the back
anningmay#1355: Ah okay interesting.  When I logged out of my LW account, my sandboxes load fine. It was being logged in that was the problem
Martin#2468: You can see a key set to `W` here so when I move forwards that indicator should light up, which only works if ~~I'm above it~~ the key switch is on screen
Martin#2468: 
Martin#2468: has anyone else noticed an issue with panel keys seemingly not working if you're below them? (or possibly if they're occluded, not sure)
anningmay#1355: Context: my entire area is suffering from a FIOS Internet outage, and this has been happening ever since
anningmay#1355: 
zjobke#1742: ????
IsCoffeeTho#0001: if you copy something too large the music that is currently playing gets cut off
bejoscha#0284: I can only rotate them after grabbing them, not while they are placed.
Dragon Lord#6944: That's when I (mostly) saw it too.
pilonpl#4015: *that are not in the center of a block
pilonpl#4015: this error occurs every time i try to move multiple sockets
Dragon Lord#6944: Yeah
pilonpl#4015: it happens when you load a save after this message
Dragon Lord#6944: For real though, this is one of the most common bugs that I came across while playing on servers. It seems to happen if you get disconnected because of the item out of index error. Next time you join a server it will have this issue
Dragon Lord#6944: Get stick bugged lol
pilonpl#4015: i cant even pause the game
pilonpl#4015: wut
pilonpl#4015: 
C4io#2688: Hold ctrl
JC Denton#9567: Does not happen on an another server
Deleted User#0000: why arent there any transparent panels 😢
JC Denton#9567: 2021-10-27T16:10:39Z | ERROR | [SceneAndNetworkManager] going to error screen with message: "Index was outside the bounds of the array." <[newline]> This happened when I tried to join Anarchy server
Doctor Stupid#9197: if you changed the view distance reset it back to 600, that worked for me on that server
pilonpl#4015: Moving multiple pegs that are not on the center of a block doesn't work properly
zjobke#1742: I restarted the game, I still cant move any buffers. it doesnt matter how and where I place them, I cant rotate them.
pilonpl#4015: but restarting the game solves the issue
zjobke#1742: 1 second ago I used to be able to rotate this buffer using Q, and now I dont seem to be able to anymore. its probably fixed once I restart the game, but I'll report this bug anyways.
pilonpl#4015: 
wideirp#8346: I am having trouble hooking up 3 small sockets in a grid on my main save. It was working great then I moved a board and now I get collision errors when I try to replace it to its original position unless the sockets are removed. Is there a work around?
Stenodyon#8192: amd gpu ?
Stenodyon#8192: Oh god
pilonpl#4015: 
PseudoGoose#2841: Dang, just absolutely destroyed Jimmy's masterpiece, his pride and joy <:omg:694415668258537482>
CrispyPin#1149: Jimmy the colour menu broke
melonik#8905: cannot launch singleplayer worlds
Darth feir#7467: game crashes every time i try to join server any ideas for remedies
pipe01#7194: Huh. Try Ctrl+F5
Ecconia#4929: Oh then we have to ping <@!128545421579517952> cause he is the website boss 😛
pilonpl#4015: 
Gositi#4985: yea
Ecconia#4929: What do you mean with this? <[newline]> Accounts are created on https://logicworld.net and only there. Your Steam username is not considered. <[newline]> You then login with LogicWorld by pressing the "log in" or "sign in" button in the top left corner of the Main-Menu (starting menu) of LogicWorld. <[newline]> The game does almost have no Steam framework to play fair with all the players that purchased the game at other sources.
IsCoffeeTho#0001: well
LolzDEV#3402: well....
Deleted User#0000: :> am happy that there will be a ping system
Broyojo#2667: this happens when there are lots of components sometimes
Broyojo#2667: very hmm
Saltypretzel#0321: hmmmmmmmm
cheese3660#8641: nevermind it did in fact paste (after crashing LW)
cheese3660#8641: looks like im stuck with 64 lines for now
cheese3660#8641: ~~totally not copying and pasting 64 rows of program rom~~
cheese3660#8641: Wow copying and pasting is kinda unoptimized
musashi#0210: yeah i still havent found a fix to either of these >:/
Dragon Lord#6944: portal 2 in logic world confirmed
PseudoGoose#2841: I have definitely gotten confused a couple times
PseudoGoose#2841: It also doesn't help that the order of "main menu" and "quit game" buttons is swapped on the error screen, compared to the ingame Esc menu
Jimmy#8080: We will definitely be adding this
Jimmy#8080: I have seen this complaint a lot 😄
Jimmy#8080: Lol I gotchu, I'm moving the quit button way far away from all the other buttons in 0.90.1
DjSapsan#4530: logic states are broken after loading the world
musashi#0210: and when i try the anarchy server, i get "index was outside the bounds of the array"
musashi#0210: i have 8gbs
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: How much ram?
musashi#0210: my game crashes every time i try to load in to ecconia.de, and while its loading it sucking up all my ram, whats going on? is it just me?
katkosmos#6502: 
Sanarek#4528: i tested and it's replicatable
Sanarek#4528: Found a crash, multi-selecting lots of pegs that are wired together, grabbing and deleting crashes the game
alion02#1973: same with "High", but to a lesser extent https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FF2600&bcolor=5A5A5A
alion02#1973: the text color for "Performance Impact: Extreme" is not accessible https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=D72000&bcolor=5A5A5A
oddron#8955: I'm trying to write a program that can read a world file, and I found a nitpick error in the Blotter File Format specifications. The Peg Address is listed as having 6 bytes; this should be 9 bytes to be consistent with the description of a peg address (1 byte for the direction, 4 bytes for the component address, 4 bytes for the peg index) https://gist.github.com/JimmyCushnie/bebea37a21acbb6e669589967f9512a2#peg-address
circuitgamer77#0377: I know - Logic World Mobile!  Pain...
musashi#0210: same
musashi#0210: yeah
circuitgamer77#0377: Buttons are too small.
circuitgamer77#0377: It takes me about twice as long to type something on a phone than on an actual keyboard...
Deleted User#0000: yeah but every time you open the keyboard it resets
musashi#0210: lol
musashi#0210: phones have caps lock
circuitgamer77#0377: But yes, direct messages would be nice :)
Deleted User#0000: no im on phone
circuitgamer77#0377: Caps lock?
Deleted User#0000: A PING SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLAYER I NEED TO TELL ME MAN "YEAH DUDE THE 23 BUTTON ON THE PANEL" FOR HIM TO UNDERSTAND
pilonpl#4015: M o r e  o p t i o n s
cheese3660#8641: Even though itd be kinda ugly
cheese3660#8641: There should be an option somewhere to allow wire clipping
pilonpl#4015: lol
pilonpl#4015: i was just enjoying the game
pilonpl#4015: wut
cheese3660#8641: Pls
DanielGJ44#4557: But without a control s command in LW I tend to use the quit button 😔
DanielGJ44#4557: My standard practice for most programs nowadays is Ctrl+S and then Alt+F4, I prefer doing things that way generally lol
CrispyPin#1149: and also move the quit button to the corner of the screen
Reese4221#8317: yea this would be really good
Deleted User#0000: MOTHERFUCKER AYO JIMMY CAN YOU ADD A "ARE YOU SURE U WANT TO QUIT" MESSAGE AFTER YOU PRESS QUIT I THINK I QUIT THE GAME 20 TIMES
CrispyPin#1149: funky panel displays
pilonpl#4015: Creating an account with steam doesn't work :(
MiniStumpy#5653: what's wrong with it
Radiant#3222: that x2
Radiant#3222: 
Radiant#3222: 
Radiant#3222: 
Buzz#6223: And then for absolutely every mouse event it scrolls in that same direction until you do move your mouse
Buzz#6223: Idk if this is what you tried or not, but it seems to only happen after scrolling and not moving your mouse at all
Stefan#5422: Server is still here
cheese3660#8641: did I kill the server
CrispyPin#1149: cant place this assembly back where it was created despite it supposedly being valid
Stefan#5422: + all ui died <[newline]> happened on connecting to ecconia.de
Limón#7879: Place moddee components for easy crash
cheese3660#8641: I've managed to crash everyone on a server twice when doing stuff that should be normal
Limón#7879: Like flying placable pieces
Limón#7879: You can do a lot of funky stuff with mounts
cheese3660#8641: https://logicworld.net/tracker/152
cheese3660#8641: yep, this is reproducible
Stenodyon#8192: <:oh_no:562781045993373696>
cheese3660#8641: curesed mount
cheese3660#8641: at least thats what I think happened in multiplayer
cheese3660#8641: Increasing the pins on an activated display crashes the game
LolzDEV#3402: same thing for me
Control#8680: I've had something similar happen to me on windows, where an output of an AND gate should have been false, but was still true
Doctor Stupid#9197: thank you!!!
kplayslive_#8332: I created a folder with a manifest in GameData, deleted it, loaded a world and it said I was missing the mod, despite having never loaded the world since creating the folder. Low priority as this is resolved by restarting, but is inconvenient
Riku#9814: Ah okay, I'll report it then
Jimmy#8080: https://logicworld.net/tracker/game
Jimmy#8080: Hm, I don't think this is on the tracker yet, so you could make a ticket there that would serve as a central place to discuss the issue and report any findings about it
Jimmy#8080: If I think of anything I'll let you know
Riku#9814: Anything I can do to help you debug it?
Riku#9814: Ahh. I'm on archlinux so maybe it's from updated libraries or drivers?
Jimmy#8080: It's a bug with some linux systems, I have no idea what causes it and I haven't been able to reproduce on my linux installs :(
Riku#9814: I'm not sure if this has been reported yet but.. Sometimes when I try to place something from the hotbar, it suddenly changes to a different hotbar item and it can make it extremely frustrating to work with
oddron#8955: 🤣
Dragon Lord#6944: it's just not a great idea to expect it to work
Dragon Lord#6944: sure it is!
Saltypretzel#0321: I dont think it is a great idea to make 128 bit adder in logic world at the moemnt
Saltypretzel#0321: I made a 128 bit adder and this is the result
Saltypretzel#0321: jimmy please explain
Biggycheese69420#4947: ok thanks
musashi#0210: take your time man
Jimmy#8080: Aiming for Friday but it depends on how quickly my injury heals
Biggycheese69420#4947: how long until 0.90.1?
Jimmy#8080: will be fixed in 0.90.1
Orionater#6345: There is a slight issue that when you multi select things that have alot of connections. And then delete them when they're multi selected the game crashes. But when you load the game back the thing you deleted is gone. (Like it should be)
FinnyBc#1852: That works!
Zoey#7836: Try turning your render distance all the way down before loading the world, you can turn it back up after you have loaded
circuitgamer77#0377: I had that happen, my first world is unusable at the moment.
FinnyBc#1852: Has anyone reported an issue loading into large worlds? When I load in I can look around for a couple seconds and then it hard crashes. This happened after I made a 256 x 32bit word ram module on one world and a 256 x 16bit word ram module on another world. It was stable until I exit to menu and try to reload the worlds. (32bit ram world: 77244 components, 88687 wires. 16bit ram world: 26621 components, 40484 wires.)
Jimmy#8080: bless up!
ReVeck#7181: done
ReVeck#7181: might it also be a problem cuz of LAN?
Jimmy#8080: Do you mind creating an issue for it? I'm liable to lose track otherwise. <https://logicworld.net/tracker/game>
ReVeck#7181: xD
Jimmy#8080: if this is another "loading instrument data breaks in some regions" I'm gonna flip
Jimmy#8080: thanks
ReVeck#7181: Belgium
Jimmy#8080: what country are you in?
ReVeck#7181: my brother also just started the game today and had the same issue
Jimmy#8080: issue persists after computer restart? nothing in the logs?
Jimmy#8080: damn, I have no clue
ReVeck#7181: windows 64bit
Jimmy#8080: in 0.90.1 there will be a server-side config to reject components with too many pegs
Jimmy#8080: what OS?
CrispyPin#1149: jimmy rest your wrists pls
CrispyPin#1149: ~~step 1: fuck around and find out~~
Jimmy#8080: Let me know if you figure out steps to reliably reproduce!
Jimmy#8080: THANK YOU SO MUCH. Can you leave a comment linking to this video in <https://logicworld.net/tracker/111> ?
CrispyPin#1149: i set a display to 24 pegs and this happens to both people connected
Buzz#6223: lmao ig, not good for pixel art stuff tho <a:why:879118980281937962>
Nik#1011: ~~looks kinda cool tbh hope they keep this~~
Ecconia#4929: (Add label + display + socket z-buffer fighting to that list)
Buzz#6223: really far away boards look like this
cheese3660#8641: clearing the console hangs the game
oddron#8955: If I'm trying to build a larger assembly from boards, then I am likely to be copying and deleting boards all the time. Being able to delete several boards rapidly by typing "gr" is very convenient
PseudoGoose#2841: I like the suggestion though. I understand the semantics behind the original controls, and its somewhat good for preventing accidental deletes. But I do think it would be more intuitive to make large deletes "hold to confirm" instead of needing to grab the parent board first.
Stenodyon#8192: You can grab a board with g and delete it and everything on it with r
Yrk06#4697: Not really a bug but I think there should be a "quick delete" button, for example, if I hold R for 3 seconds it will delete the object and everything on top of it, instead of having to delete manually component by component
ReVeck#7181: i'm new to the game and i'm trying out the 'singer' but i'm not getting any sound, also selecting other type of instrument sounds doesn't help. Any1 know why this is? (other sounds just work fine like buttons etc)
Ecconia#4929: This basically happens whenever you run any server command on a multiplayer server. <[newline]> (Might only be if you have no admins in the config files, cause then nobody has permissions to use commands, which of course results in a stacktrace 😋)
Radiant#3222: if its in the integrated server its fine
DADp#7461: i think the server command in general is just broken
Radiant#3222: 
Radiant#3222: 
Biggycheese69420#4947: the and gate updates visually delete the output and replace it and it makes it a three input one
CrispyPin#1149: you can convert a save to gridlands by changing `WorldTypeID: MHG.Grasslands`  to `WorldTypeID: MHG.Gridlands` in `worldinfo.succ`
oxi#0420: damn the server that im on is in grasslands
CrispyPin#1149: not grasslands
oxi#0420: ok
CrispyPin#1149: you can only do that in gridlands
oxi#0420: how would you line it up on the ground tho?
oxi#0420: yeah very vertical
CrispyPin#1149: but if its a screen i assume its vertical
CrispyPin#1149: although it only happens when placing on a board, if you place things next to each other on the ground it works as expected
oxi#0420: ah ok
CrispyPin#1149: i dont know of any
oxi#0420: is there anyway to fix it when it happens?
oxi#0420: ah ok
CrispyPin#1149: because yes there is a bug with that
oxi#0420: yes
CrispyPin#1149: do you have sockets?
oxi#0420: is there a weird collision detection bug for placing objects? when duplicating my screen panel occasionally it says i cant place it right next to the previous panel but then it lets me place it on the other side?
CrispyPin#1149: wat
Jakob#0654: i dont have a slow computer
Jakob#0654: and keeps hanging
Jakob#0654: like for 10 minutes
Jakob#0654: <@!154964593397989376> server or client hangs when loading a big world... (3.7Mb)
C4io#2688: <@154964593397989376> I found a bug where if you use Multi-Select on two boards that are connected and copy them, pasting them the game will break
cheese3660#8641: Thank you
pipe01#7194: Logs say that username is taken, but I'm not sure why you're seeing that error instead
cheese3660#8641: <@!128545421579517952> I'm not able to create an account on website, it says an internal error has occured
N_58#8502: The game loads very long time for you? I also have this :/
Zoey#7836: Found a way to reliably reproduce the bug from scratch!
Control#8680: thx
Stenodyon#8192: The game makes backups of your worlds, you can try reverting to a previous backup (they are located in the game data folder that you can open in the main menu)
Control#8680: (tried making 24x16 GoL)
Control#8680: (my building was too big apparently)
Control#8680: maybe later someone can help me recover it?
Control#8680: i lost my world yesterday
FalsePattern#7777: try this: go into the server folder, open config.succ, and increase the value of `AutosaveIntervalSeconds`
Zoey#7836: Can't seem to replicate the bug on a smaller design, but it is repeatable on the complex design. Will update if I find more info
gotenks917#3427: ok will try
Zoey#7836: If this happens, try turning your render distance all the way down. You can turn it back up once you have loaded in
gotenks917#3427: if you wanna try loading the world here it is
gotenks917#3427: it loaded then crashed
gotenks917#3427: crashed my game but now ive been sitting at the loading screen tring to load my level for the past minute
gotenks917#3427: these are strange times
gotenks917#3427: now its loading
gotenks917#3427: wait maybe not the biulding sounds just playd
Jimmy#8080: what a slacker
gotenks917#3427: lmao
gotenks917#3427: if you clone large enough builds the game just gives up
Jimmy#8080: I won't be able to work on the game for a few more days anyway so no rush
Jimmy#8080: cheers
Zoey#7836: I'll try to narrow down the cause, have only noticed it in a rather complex design so far
Jimmy#8080: Thank you <@492362038681796619> . It would be extremely helpful if you could make a video of you causing the bug, starting from a fresh save.
Ecconia#4929: I had this before, that is when players INTENTIONALLY or by accident make a circular dependency. Placing some components on the component itself... <[newline]> Sadly there is a thread on how to do that by now. <[newline]> (might have other reasons though)
Zoey#7836: It seems to be an issue with it not updating. Connecting an empty post causes the "off" wire to update & turn on (as it should be).
katkosmos#6502: Happened with the dedicated server I'm running for a discord server I'm administrator in earlier today. Not really sure what caused it
Zoey#7836: (upper boards are mid move to get the screenshot, moving them is unrelated to the bug)
Zoey#7836: Found a bug in the logic system. Look at the relays at the bottom middle. Bug reliably triggers with the same sequence of inputs
Jimmy#8080: I agree, I have a lot of improvements I want to make to the keybindings system, it's far from done
Jimmy#8080: in the future you can edit or just delete `settings_profile[number].succ`
Jimmy#8080: that's hilarious
Jimmy#8080: hahahahaha
jackson535#1361: it took me 9 minutes to somehow undo this, because I couldn't left click anything as file explorer would block it
jackson535#1361: I was trying to set the "open screenshot folder" key to 0, but I accidentally registered left click
Nik#1011: it's pretty ambitious, not surprising
jackson535#1361: the keybinding system has some problems for sure
jackson535#1361: oh man
Nik#1011: LMAO you can't set "backwards mouse button" as a binding without first removing that key as one of the menu navigation bindings
PseudoGoose#2841: the sheer absolute unit of 50MB might be screwing with some timeouts or something
PseudoGoose#2841: and it's only with that save. If I load a smaller one (tho still 18MB), it autosaves every minute
PseudoGoose#2841: to be fair, this is probably way larger than any other save that has been loaded yet
PseudoGoose#2841: here's the start of it
PseudoGoose#2841: 
gotenks917#3427: good lord image if you had a hard drive lmao
PseudoGoose#2841: i think the server just took several minutes to load the save, and once it finished loading, it started autosaving like this
Jimmy#8080: wtf
PseudoGoose#2841: ok, this is interesting, it started happening again several minutes into loading the same file
PseudoGoose#2841: it has only happened that one time, idk why
Nik#1011: holy crap
PseudoGoose#2841: it is chewing through my SSD at 60+MB/s
PseudoGoose#2841: very interesting, for some reason the server has decided to autosave every second
Broyojo#2667: flag tower
Saltypretzel#0321: jimmy please explain
Saltypretzel#0321: closing it too
Saltypretzel#0321: opening console with ` make the game hang and lag a lot
Dragon Lord#6944: Ye haw! While trying to do a multi-wire placement, my game froze up so badly that it even stopped my browser from playing Spotify in the background. I waited for 5 to 10 minutes, and then cut my losses and forced a shutdown lol.
circuitgamer77#0377: For me it was dependent on the parent board, not the world, unless it was actually placed as the world as the parent.
cheese3660#8641: So floating point error
cheese3660#8641: Whether it tiles or not is literally dependent on where the board is in the world
Broyojo#2667: the game is being mean to you
cheese3660#8641: This should tile
cheese3660#8641: I found a way to get wires to clip, if you move a board to where one of the wires out of it would clip, and it deletes the clipping wire, if you undo, it will respawn the deleted wire, but not undo the board movement yet that happens the next time you undo
pepperell#2291: Thanks bubbles 😄
Chime#3134: https://tenor.com/view/somethings-fucky-hmm-looking-around-i-smell-bs-trailer-park-boys-gif-17153625
pepperell#2291: Here it is working with a 4-and
pepperell#2291: Ah i see. OK I changed it to a 4-and and now I can resize the panel. Back to 2-and and it can't be resized.
pepperell#2291: Nope just stock and gate. didn't even know you could do that
Chime#3134: did you change the input count on the and gate at all?
pepperell#2291: Ha I deleted every component except for this AND gate. Still can't resize. I delete the AND gate and now I can resize. No way there is any conflict here
pepperell#2291: Hah I restarted the game and now none of those horizontal panels can be resized!
pepperell#2291: Ah didn't work. I cloned it, placed it on the ground, resized it, and then put it back. DONE!
pepperell#2291: Ok thanks good enough fix for me. Early access woes 😉
Chime#3134: Kinda wish panel keys could be fine-placed like pegs; the 1/3rd offset would be perfect for keyboard layout
Chime#3134: I've seen that, but not sure.  Removing and replacing seemed to fix it for me
pepperell#2291: Weird considering I just resized them all to this size, and now its like locked
pepperell#2291: well..minor rewiring changes in each
pepperell#2291: Nothing unique about this one panel. Its a copy of the others
pepperell#2291: I understand but the resize arrows do not show on any sides or any corners. See this pic.... I can resize any of the other 4 panels just fine.
Broyojo#2667: also it looks like if the game crashes the screenshots that you took don't get saved...
Broyojo#2667: it talked about a key already being in a thing
Broyojo#2667: I pressed backspace and the game crashed
Broyojo#2667: hmm I have run into some bugs
ieee 802.11ac#6337: you can't resize something into something
pepperell#2291: Seems to happen more when I have a horizontal board attached to a vertical board
pepperell#2291: Anyone run into a problem where you can't resize a panel? When I hit the hotkey on the panel, It goes into resize mode, but the resize arrows don't show
Saltypretzel#0321: lol now conjoined
Ecconia#4929: Haha this is nothing, today I saw the same player 3 times!
Saltypretzel#0321: cursed. ghost person after crash
Ecconia#4929: Did you try to rotate while holding `SHIFT`? <[newline]> Normally you can rotated in whatever rotation you desire. Q-E and T, but SHIFT is also important. <[newline]> To activate the shortcut guide press F6. <[newline]> My recommendation is to get T right. Then QE and as final step SHIFT+QE.
CrispyPin#1149: i was only removing thousands of components
asquared31415#0311: it was a fairly large world that took a long time to load but that was way too long and the feedback for it uploading was completely wrong
asquared31415#0311: I tried to upload a world, it said it did, and I closed the game.  Then like 3-5 min later the site popped up with the creation hub page.
ieee 802.11ac#6337: finely placed pegs get locations reset when multi moved https://streamable.com/dvblz7
asquared31415#0311: so you'll need to toggle flatness once, and then probably rotate a few times
asquared31415#0311: currently I think that board thinks that the "connected" part is the bottom which was placed against the ground
asquared31415#0311: shift rotate, rotate, and switch flatness is your friend
tatertacoma#1234: 
tatertacoma#1234: dang it discord...
Chime#3134: even better, if you try to Remove it, it red-highlights the one at origin
Chime#3134: oh here's one.  If you try to place a mount at an existing mount (e.g. clicking twice) it instead places a mount at world origin
mitolegy#5916: ive got no idea if its OS dependent. im just on windows 10. for all i know the bug exists on linux and macOS aswell. is kinda weird that it effects grabbing and not copying. would have thought they were basically the same operation.
tatertacoma#1234: ok i am so confused at how the board grabbing works... Like, it seems randm at times. and I try to grab them at specific angles but it seems that whereever I grab it it just always grabs at the same part...
Chime#3134: Yeah that matches what I was doing.  Is it OS dependent though?  Because that's sorta fascinating 😄
mitolegy#5916: ive gotten soft crashes doing this
mitolegy#5916: grabbing two boards that are socked together seems to cause issues in singleplayer on windows 10. copying two boards that share connections seems to work fine tho for some reason
Chime#3134: dragging multiselected groups of socket-connected boards seems to crash
oddron#8955: Feature request: Artificial lights and a night sky 🤣
oddron#8955: Is it just my perceptions, or are the in-game shadows inconsistent with the position of the sun in the skybox?

Buzz#6223: this happens like constantly (notice the AND gate is off but the relays are on)
katkosmos#6502: nvm forget backups were a thing lol
katkosmos#6502: Anyone know how to fix this?
Control#8680: nothing
Control#8680: it doesnt work
Control#8680: just
Control#8680: there is nothing in the way
Control#8680: i cant place this ahhh
CodeMaker_4#5396: I think it's the wires that cause the lag. Try making one large network of wires and chains of wires all indirectly connected with pigs in between. My guess is that the algorithm that makes these chain wires one simulation wire is slow.
jackson535#1361: this is almost twice as large in terms of file size though
jackson535#1361: this is almost twice as large in terms of file size though
jackson535#1361: idk
jackson535#1361: perhaps it's the type of component that makes it harder to load?
jackson535#1361: here is 100,000 inverters and it loaded in about 30 seconds
CrispyPin#1149: i force quit while joining because nothing was happening
Stefan#5422: Any and all of the UI broke after rejoining: <[newline]> 1. World is not loading correctly <[newline]> 2. No ui is interactable <[newline]> 3. No console
cos#8062: :D
CodeMaker_4#5396: He trollin the computer
Stefan#5422: (:
Ecconia#4929: #Mood <@!256359653124997120> made a circular child-parent relation with components :/
CodeMaker_4#5396: 1 d-latch, 2 and gates (one with 3 and one with 4 inputs) 5 through pegs and 7 normal pegs. It also uses 4 circuit boards per bit. It also has large interconnected wire networks. (As in lots of individual wires directly connected to each other with pegs in-between. There are 4 of these networks of about 4k wire pieces each)
ieee 802.11ac#6337: <@!756203036589686864>
jackson535#1361: I'll duplicate this 6 times
jackson535#1361: I made a world with more than 10k inverters and it worked fine and loaded in 6 seconds
jackson535#1361: at least as multiple machines on a server
jackson535#1361: I agree that LW should be able to handle that though
jackson535#1361: your world file says you have over 56,000 components xd
jackson535#1361: how many components did you use per byte?
Rack Smix#3697: i can't rotate up or down
DanielGJ44#4557: We've all come to the agreement that it's generally a socket problem
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah, this was talked about yesterday
JC Denton#9567: removing the one up to the new block allows to put it
JC Denton#9567: placement issues have probably been reported? There shouldn't be anything blocking this block
JC Denton#9567: 
CrispyPin#1149: i feel like the game should save whatever logic gate network it uses for the simulation, assuming generating that is the slow part of loading worlds
CodeMaker_4#5396: lmao early access be like
jackson535#1361: speaking of bugs, I just got stuck in an inverter
CodeMaker_4#5396: I hope so too, but I think it just runs out of memory while loading the last few things after the loading screen, like it uses more than 10 gigabytes
jackson535#1361: I hope that this is just world corruption or something
jackson535#1361: and yeah the ram usage was really big like you said
CodeMaker_4#5396: does the same for me lol
jackson535#1361: it crashed
CodeMaker_4#5396: for a quarter kilobyte of ram
jackson535#1361: oh nevermind
jackson535#1361: that was about 6 minutes
Ryozuki#2188: <:admiralGOTTEM:855343553910407178>
Ryozuki#2188: 
jackson535#1361: it finally loaded
CodeMaker_4#5396: maybe, or it shouldn't be advertised as high performance for now...
Ryozuki#2188: 😟
jackson535#1361: maybe this whole early access thing should be rebranded as open beta or alpha
jackson535#1361: for a game touted as letting you be able to build big, this isn't working very well
CodeMaker_4#5396: yep, also takes this long for me
jackson535#1361: how many minutes has it been, 3? 4?
jackson535#1361: still loading
jackson535#1361: huh. it's certainly taking forever to load
jackson535#1361: I'll give it a try too
CodeMaker_4#5396: it instantly crashes for me when reloading
CodeMaker_4#5396: <@!478769019873132548>
CodeMaker_4#5396: and yes I was trying to create memory with _less_ lag
CodeMaker_4#5396: Just tried to reload the world, instantly crashes
musashi#0210: drop that world download, i want to feel the lag
pepperell#8025: I placed a vertical support post, and hit edit on it, and the game crashed back to the menu with an error. Object reference not set....etc
Ryozuki#2188: sad lot of games are made with unity these days
Ryozuki#2188: thats a pity
CodeMaker_4#5396: In single player, copy/pasting a logic design with thousands of components or wires lags the game a lot. First the server lagspikes, then the client freezes. This is in singleplayer on an intel i7-975h (6 cores, ~4.06 GHz) 16gb ram sodimm. The CPU is used for 14% of the time, which roughly means it uses 100% of a single core. Also you need like a gigabyte of ram per few thousand components which is a lot for a simple logic game. <[newline]> Simulating the circuit at high speeds works just fine. <[newline]> A thousand components sounds like a lot, but building a kilobyte of ram is simply impossible with this performance, so you can't really make a fancy computer. <[newline]> Usually I don't whine about performance of games. Optimising is hard, but this lag is just insane. <[newline]> I hope optimisations can be done for copy/pasting large circuits on both the server and the client. <[newline]> If you want the world download of my 256 bytes of ram took ~10 minutes of waiting to duplicate, I can give a world download. The world file is only a few megabytes.
Ryozuki#2188: nah ill wait till they fix itr
Whisper#7076: Same except artix, use proton
CrispyPin#1149: have the same problem on pop os
Ryozuki#2188: sometimes the game doesnt open when launched from steam (using arch linux and i3wm)

circuitgamer77#0377: I'm going to bed, I'll figure this out when I get up :)
circuitgamer77#0377: Different backups of the same world have the same problem (even one from 15 minutes before the crash), but other worlds so far don't have it.
circuitgamer77#0377: Sometimes it lets me move for a moment before crashing, but my most recent backup is also broken.  Maybe it's game-wide instead of world-wide?
circuitgamer77#0377: World loads, is visible for a moment, then crashes to desktop.  No clue what caused it, restarting doesn't fix it.
Radiant#3222: 
Dragon Lord#6944: same bug here
circuitgamer77#0377: The bug happened again, where do I send the save?
Radiant#3222: lovely
circuitgamer77#0377: Anyone know where to put a save file with a bug to send it in?
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: Sometimes the Relays dont work as expected. The relays should output 1, but it outputs 0 even with two other inputs as 1
circuitgamer77#0377: I already fixed it, but when I get it again I'll send it.  Do I put the file in this chat, or is there another place to put it?
Jimmy#8080: If it persists after reloading, then send me the save so I can take a look at it
circuitgamer77#0377: Taking it off of the board it was connected to did, though.
circuitgamer77#0377: Reloading doesn't fix it..
circuitgamer77#0377: Occasionally I place a circuit board and it won't let me resize it, even if it has nothing on it.  No clue what causes it...
circuitgamer77#0377: Backup actually was a backup, user error...
circuitgamer77#0377: Backup does not appear to actually be a backup, reverting to the one that won't load...
circuitgamer77#0377: I have no clue what happed to cause an error...
circuitgamer77#0377: Yep, not loading.  Time to restore from a backup...
circuitgamer77#0377: Don't quite know if it's going to load...  Its been loading a world for a while now, but it has taken a while before...

circuitgamer77#0377: This was bugtesting land:
Jimmy#8080: Thank you!!
circuitgamer77#0377: Alright, massive ticket of bad wording is submitted :)
oddron#8955: Thank you!
C4io#2688: Press ctrl
oddron#8955: How do you place sockets off-center like that?
DanielGJ44#4557: Agreed
Mollex#9983: -> Title: socket bug Description: Read title -> Ez
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah it's definitely hard to explain
circuitgamer77#0377: This is going to be a really badly worded ticket, so sorry in advance...
DanielGJ44#4557: I think the specific build I was having problems with sockets on the boards was my sprite drawing machine, especially with all the replication of boards, but that would happen even between two sockets aligned to interact with each other
Jimmy#8080: https://logicworld.net/tracker/game :)
DanielGJ44#4557: Logicworld.net/tracker
DanielGJ44#4557: I've had similar issues with sockets, so it's certainly persisted (even since the building overhaul)
circuitgamer77#0377: I have not yet looked at the tracker, where can I get the link?
Jimmy#8080: I don't think this bug is on the tracker yet, can you make a report there with this information?
Jimmy#8080: thank you
circuitgamer77#0377: Here's the rest of the setup that caused this.  I don't think it needs to be on the extra board there, but it was the only way I was able to reliably reproduce it.
circuitgamer77#0377: The yellow board was cloned, and it would not place where the green board is.  I then added that green board by hand, and tried to place the socket.
circuitgamer77#0377: Ok, I found one at least semi-reliable way to replicate the boards colliding with nothing when being cloned, and it looks like the offending component is (drumroll...): The socket!  It seems like copying boards with sockets on the edge can cause problems.  Here's an example (finally) of the exact thing that is causing the error, instead of the general categories I was sending before:
circuitgamer77#0377: Those were supposed to be in a line
circuitgamer77#0377: Better example:
circuitgamer77#0377: Cloning them individually works fine, though.
circuitgamer77#0377: The three boards on the right are not on the main center board.
circuitgamer77#0377: When copying multiple boards, occasionally some of the boards will not align with the board they are being placed on.
Buzz#6223: this probably isn't intentional, but a way to get around it for now is to hold down control while you're moving them c:
circuitgamer77#0377: Hey, it loaded the second time!  No clue what happened to cause it to fail to load last time, but it's working now...
Buzz#6223: this seems to only occur when the wires go from a component on one board to a component on another, and if the boards aren't connected to each other
Buzz#6223: original on right, copied on left
Buzz#6223: When copying, sometimes most of the wires just kind of disappear :|
circuitgamer77#0377: I think the save is corrupted - it constantly crashes on load.  To load a backup do you just drag the backup folder into the saves folder?
circuitgamer77#0377: The whole game just crashed on load after the bug where everything turns invisible after a crash...  I hope my world is not corrupted...
Buzz#6223: like SUPER far away from the rest of the selection, too
Buzz#6223: copying (ctrl+g) often includes random pegs and stuff that dont actually exist (that i know of >_>) in the selection
anningmay#1355: Obviously it can be done, but it ain’t the greatest
anningmay#1355: On behalf of those of us who use laptops with trackpads, please make sure to include a non scroll wheel option for everything if you can
Jimmy#8080: I personally do and I enjoy using the scroll wheel for it, our beta testers seemed to like it as well. But LW should be for everyone! I want to do everything I can to have great accessibility
oddron#8955: Thank you
Jimmy#8080: Q and E is a great idea! Thanks, I'll add those as additional options in the default controls, so you an use Q/E or the scrollwheel
ieee 802.11ac#6337: website bug - that's not good
circuitgamer77#0377: also, doesn't look like the game likes bulk resizing boards...
circuitgamer77#0377: Well, I was able to replicate the board bug, just not reliably...
pipe01#7194: It seems like you don't have permission to broadcast UDP for some reason
pipe01#7194: lol
Limón#7879: WHY DID IT WORK
Limón#7879: WHAT THE FUCK
Limón#7879: but ill try anything
Limón#7879: I feel like that would not fix it
circuitgamer77#0377: Doesn't look like the board bug is anything simple...  I'm confused.  Many test cases, I expected it to show up on at least 1...  (those are each made of an 8x8 of cloned 4x4 boards with different components on them)
pipe01#7194: You could try to set `AnnounceOnLocalNetwork` to `false` in the server's config.succ

oddron#8955: Bug: I can't pick a component (with P) if the hotbar is full and the component is not already on the hotbar. Related feature request: I would like to be able to select a component directly from the selection menu and place it in the world while bypassing the hotbar.
circuitgamer77#0377: Well, I don't think the board bug is caused just by large amounts of copying boards, I just copied a ton of 4x4 boards onto another board, and none of them collided with the others...
oddron#8955: Also, I'm assuming most people have the dexterity to operate the scroll wheel with a second finger while holding a mouse button down?
oddron#8955: Q and E seem to work
circuitgamer77#0377: That's the crash I got before I reopened the world and everything vanishes until I reload.
circuitgamer77#0377: I got that crash sometimes when I tried to copy a board with sockets that were close together (had to use ctrl to place them without overlapping), but not every time.
berry#1313: *whenever I multi select delete
berry#1313: get this crash whenever I multi select something that includes wire connections, is this common?
circuitgamer77#0377: For future reference, if it's helpful, here's a project that I got that bug with.  Yellow squares don't fit due to a board that is not the bottom layer, red don't fit due to the bottom layer.
Jimmy#8080: It's under the "building" heading, it's called "increase/decrease multi-wire placing offset" or something
Mollex#9983: oh no wait u mean cloning board nvm
Mollex#9983: maybe it helps u
Mollex#9983: can i show u?
Mollex#9983: circuit i have a similar bug
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm experimenting to try to spot patterns.
circuitgamer77#0377: Well, I think I can safely eliminate world coordinates from the list of possibilities.  It's definitely local to the board, not the world.
oddron#8955: In the list of controls, I don't see any items that have "scroll while left clicking" in the column that lists keys and mouse buttons. I would suggest a control style that lets me adjust the multi-wire placing interval after I release the left mouse button, instead of while I'm holding it down.
Jimmy#8080: I really want to fix this, if you figure out a reliable way to reproduce the bug then please put it on the tracker
Jimmy#8080: You can change the controls in settings. What would you suggest for a better default?
circuitgamer77#0377: This has probably already been mentioned, but occasionally when cloning boards it thinks the boards are colliding (inconsistently) which makes it impossible to put a board in that spot.
cos#8062: ecconia's video shows this pretty well
cos#8062: as long as they are inline and you can smash them together with the edge of the board
cos#8062: does not matter where the components start
Stenodyon#8192: You can rotate a component after it is placed, but if it is blocked by something it won't rotate
kiveon#0480: multi select doesn't work with different key binds
Funky Egg#5652: Do they start in the board or on the ground and does it work if the ground is not grass
DanielGJ44#4557: But that's my memory of why this is no longer possible
DanielGJ44#4557: Though it was my impression that rotation would be allowed if no wires are affected by it... Idk if it got that far
oddron#8955: Accessibility bug: When placing multiple wires, the controls to change the multi-wire placing interval require using the scroll wheel while holding the left mouse button. For some people (like me) it is physically difficult or impossible to operate the scroll wheel while my finger is already occupied holding down the left mouse button
DanielGJ44#4557: Ok... So that was a complaint during beta and that feature was intentionally removed. It's really easy to accidentally fuck up your entire circuit if you have wires connected and rotation behavior was unpredictable (borderline useless) with objects that were not square
circuitgamer77#0377: Use G to pick it up, then it can be rotated, unless I misunderstood...
oddron#8955: Bug: There is no way to rotate a part after it is placed, and the instructions to rotate while placing are effectively hidden. More specifically, when left-clicking to place a part (i.e. click and immediately release - that's what a left click is), the "help" instructions for rotating a part never appear, leaving no apparent way to rotate a part

commanderguy3001#6660: <@!192561908497252353> uuh that's just a blackscreen
Delta#3713: Moving a board and moving the cursor over a flag has some weird behavior
commanderguy3001#6660: a problem
commanderguy3001#6660: which is
commanderguy3001#6660: Problem here is: LW has to calculate the positions of every vertex of every flag every frame, the more flags the more calculations and therefore the more time, and it doesn't draw a frame when it didn't yet calculate all the flags
Stenodyon#8192: Ah thanks, two other people encountered the crash with Czech locale as well
nenico87#3666: Czech one
Stenodyon#8192: with which locale did you encounter the crash?
commanderguy3001#6660: remove them

ieee 802.11ac#6337: ok so the error lies it does not support mp3
ieee 802.11ac#6337: uh...?
Stenodyon#8192: I think singleplayer just creates a local server
Dragon Lord#6944: well, that kills that idea XD
Hugin#2596: idk how the game works, but just to clarify, it was singleplayer
cos#8062: if you click really fast on servers you can place components in eachother
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hmmmm
Dragon Lord#6944: I've seen this one a lot too. It seems to be caused by server desync. From what I've seen, if you try to move a component that is on your screen but not on the server's end it can crash you, and then when you rejoin it can make everything not show up unless you restart the game. Kind of makes me wonder if there's cashing in on the client side...
Ecconia#4929: Multi-Wire-Placement is cool and such. But it really shines, when you skip pegs. Cause then its really powerful in tedious edge cases. <[newline]> Too bad on mouse-key-up when you set the group, it does some sort of shuffle and reliably picks the wrong pegs. <[newline]> Important note: Only the first group fails the skipping with mouse wheel. The second works flawlessly. <[newline]> (Sorry for the bad video - LogicWorld has the bad habit of forcing itself into the foreground and in general super bad focus handling - a real pain for my usual workflow).
cos#8062: when moved will turn into a stack of 3 and a stack of 6
cos#8062: 
cos#8062: e.g
cos#8062: if you select a bunch of components that have fine placement and move them they sometimes overlap
Aircondition#1162: https://logicworld.net/tracker/91 There has been a development! It turns out my Slovak language setting caused the bug!
cos#8062: in the edit menu
cos#8062: works with any component that can be resized
cos#8062: 
cos#8062: 
cos#8062: 
Ecconia#4929: So the labels and sockets have z-Buffer fighting. <[newline]> If I had to point my finger on the worst bug of all the ones I know by now - its z-Buffer fighting. Its visually displeasing. <[newline]> For labels its a serious downside in usability.
Ecconia#4929: (Do not mind the zooming, that is cause the German keyboard is broken)
Ecconia#4929: 
Ecconia#4929: Bug report by <@!326461320742567937> (Reformatted) <[newline]> If you select a bunch of components and move them onto the edge of a board, you can force them into each other. <[newline]> The outline turns red, which indicates the collision. However the collision does not prevent the placement.
cos#8062: you can overlap components when selecting them all and then moving them onto a board
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> I broke your baby... <[newline]> The reproduction is dead easy, just take one and drag it over the whole field. You will get a bunch of index out of bounds exception in console then. <[newline]> This results in the game being eventually frozen. Duplication of colors and empty spots.
Gositi#4985: and it also happened that it looked like everything disappeared and I couldn't do anything. I was on a server BTW
Gositi#4985: and my game crashed and so on multiple times
Gositi#4985: 
MiniStumpy#5653: When trying to increase / decrease the panel display pin count, the game will give out an error
oddron#8955: If I duplicate a vertical circuit board and rotate it to horizontal, there seems to be no way to flip the board over
nalili#7058: My server doesn't want to start, even after I uninstalled / reinstalled the tools, it still doesn't want.
DanielGJ44#4557: This is a certified windows moment
nalili#7058: ???
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hmmm
Ecconia#4929: So we had this issue, where we could no longer register new flags. Only the old ones had been visible. <[newline]> Even a server restart did not fix it. Which led me to believe at some point (when it annoyed me). That some file must be corrupted. <[newline]> So I renamed the `FlagListOrdfer` and `TotalFlagCount` file. That fixed the problem. <[newline]> Old content of the flag list order: <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> DataType: System.Collections.Generic.List<LogicAPI.Data.ComponentAddress> <[newline]> Data: <[newline]>     - C-17E93 <[newline]>     - C-160F6 <[newline]>     - C-17ED6 <[newline]>     - C-1F281 <[newline]>     - C-1FEAD <[newline]> ```New content: <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> DataType: System.Collections.Generic.List<LogicAPI.Data.ComponentAddress> <[newline]> Data: <[newline]>     - C-160F6 <[newline]>     - C-17ED6 <[newline]>     - C-1FEAD <[newline]>     - C-2043D <[newline]> ```The flags we placed and which had not been visible suddenly had been listed - yay. Well cleaned them up by now. So the content of the files is not relevant. But however it threw the "flag is null" errors for 4 of the 6 old entries. So deleting a flag did not remove it from that list, which prevented adding any new flags. I do not know how to initially break it.
Just Kris#0001: hahahah
Yrk06#4697: I found a bug with the relays, I wasn't able to discover a minimum test to reliably get the bug. My circuit would "enable" the relay (let it pass the data) but the relay would behave as if it was still closed (different states on both sides). If I deleted the cable connecting the relay enable pin and connected again, then it would correctly pass the data. After replacing some relays and changing the cable order I the bug vanished
Macrohard Onfire#0662: After getting an error you're better off restarting. Error is purely client side (it happened to me on a server and the server was perfectly fine) and it does something weird. For me, when i connected back everything sjowed up but disappeared when i tried to place a wire
Hugin#2596: I got an error, went back to the main menu, loaded the world, and it was nearly empty <[newline]> after restarting the game everything was ok but it still got my heart racing
Ecconia#4929: You can move a component, such that wires will intersect and thus be removed. Then using `Undo` will restore the wires, ignoring any collision. <[newline]> It should instead move the component back AND also restore the wires.
CrispyPin#1149: understandable
Ecconia#4929: ``` <[newline]>    at LogicWorld.Server.Networking.Implementation.LidgrenNetworkServer.Process() in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Logic World/Server/Code/Server/Networking/Implementation/LidgrenNetworkServer.cs:line 100 <[newline]>    at LogicWorld.Server.Server.ServerTick(Object source, ElapsedEventArgs e) in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Logic World/Server/Code/Server/Server.cs:line 177```And I totally agree to this opinion.

CrispyPin#1149: *music intensifies*
Slimepunk#3355: moving pieces to a place where wires break then using undo brings wires back even though they go through boards
iHouqLF#8910: i guess this is not good
Leo3065#5297: Happened after removing a bunch of delayers on a board by multi select and pressing R
oxi#0420: im guessing you guys already know this bug but when someone is connecting their body gets pushed into random people
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> I kind of doubt the wholesomeness of this game by now 😛 <[newline]> Also you have a flag to remove...

Stenodyon#8192: uh oh
oxi#0420: im gonna steam verify files
oxi#0420: my game crashed and now wont load
PLYSHKA#6201: better safe than sorry
Whisper#7076: Bruh handle some errors don't just throw lol
Whisper#7076: 
Stenodyon#8192: I ran the game with the Slovak locale and I got the crash, it's definitely caused by locale
Radiant#3222: text renderer broke
Radiant#3222: 
Radiant#3222: 
Deleted User#0000: did aswell, but it, well crashed windows
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: when does this error occur exactly?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: just tried on windows with jp locale, seems to work fine
Stenodyon#8192: so sorry about this :( hopefully it should be fixed next week
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <:thonking:432741465844875264> thanks steam
Deleted User#0000: For me it's more sadly, that I awaiting for the game for more than year, and at the day on launch happy to buy to be ... just disappointed from the crash wellllll
Stenodyon#8192: interesting <:think:762087260912746526> this is promising, I think Jimmy should be able to find and fix the problem quickly
Whisper#7076: There is no user called Server
Whisper#7076: 
Whisper#7076: Someone has found out how to chat as the Server
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: "few hours" more like "few minutes"
Deleted User#0000: all tested with locale emulator, it failed on all computers
Stenodyon#8192: ah thanks! maybe it's just locale emulator that failed
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: see if that also gives issues
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i can try it on japanese locale in a few hours
Deleted User#0000: or can be correct, my all friends, that tested with different locales, if the locales are not english, the error appears
Nepchunya#6765: <:megathink:797979154549178399>
Deleted User#0000: But my friend launch the same game files normally on different PC with English Locale, so it still can be caused by maybe unsupported locale
Deleted User#0000: I tried English UK & United States locales and both crashed on the same error
Stenodyon#8192: ah crap, my suspicion is incorrect then
Deleted User#0000: So, I tried it with Locale Emulator, with pain & command line I get it to work, but same error, but it took longer time to operate...
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I used to use https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/ very often <[newline]> ("used to" because I am using linux now)
MiniStumpy#5653: I am
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if so, you could try locale emulator
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: are you on windows?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: hmm
Deleted User#0000: The problem is, that every locale installation is crashing, so I can't install any other locales
Stenodyon#8192: Yes if the error is caused by system locale it should be a simple fix, would very likely be in v90.1
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but that will make the rest of your system rather uh
Deleted User#0000: uhhh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: possibly as a workaround you could change your locale (obviously this isn't a fix)
Deleted User#0000: and would be there fix for it or any solution maybe?
MiniStumpy#5653: lmao
Deleted User#0000: and I checked yours aswell
Deleted User#0000: check my about me bruh
MiniStumpy#5653: Omg a slovak! xD
Stenodyon#8192: ah, that confirms my suspicion
Deleted User#0000: Slovak
MiniStumpy#5653: Czech
Stenodyon#8192: <@456226577798135808> <@!454977737971728395> I have a suspicion that this might be caused by system locale, what is your system language ?
Ecconia#4929: Well, I would make this a bug report. But there is no stacktrace anywhere. <[newline]> Someone was moving or grabbing a bigger board.
Deleted User#0000: I got idea that I could test different windows, but when I see, you have different, I am not going then test it
MiniStumpy#5653: windows 10
Deleted User#0000: and you have windows 7 or different version?
MiniStumpy#5653: I know you do
Deleted User#0000: you aren't alone, I have it too
Ecconia#4929: Running on FullHD right now.
Ecconia#4929: I very often have it, that part of the text just gets white spots. <[newline]> Getting closer and looking from a different angle fixes it. <[newline]> It does not look like z-Buffer fighting, it might be?
circuitgamer77#0377: I had that happen earlier - my fix was alt-f4 to get out and just restarting the game.  The floating things and UI problems are just visual as far as I can tell.
Ecconia#4929: `tp <playername>` and `tp "<playername>"` never worked for me before.
Ecconia#4929: The `tp 0 0 0` command only executes as soon as you close your console - is that intentional?
Ecconia#4929: I figured out the cause. <[newline]> Whenever you run a server command using `server "<command>"` tested with `stats.simulation` and `server.rate <number>` - very unfortunate...
Operu#6600: I cant place anything and this chubby socket now floats. <[newline]> What happened is i placed a few circuit boards on a wall and then placed a socket to connect it while it was on the wall. It didnt like that for some reason and i got kicked out the game. <[newline]>  <[newline]> I then rejoined and placed the socket the same way that got me crashed and the wall got deleted and now it floats. <[newline]>  <[newline]> The game is completely broken i cant place anything or even press ESC but i can still move around freely
Deleted User#0000: what if the screenshot thing had an orthographic view for seeing 2d circuits
IsLilyYaGirl#3013: i've somehow gotten 2 boards to be linked (if you grab/clone one it does the same to the other)
MiniStumpy#5653: because this just bugs me
MiniStumpy#5653: Did anyone else encounter the "Failed to deserialize LogicAPI.Networking.Packets.Packet value" bug?
IsLilyYaGirl#3013: nothing in console
IsLilyYaGirl#3013: when grabbing a board and mousing over the side of a mount, the ghost board flies away at speed but returns when you move your mouse off of the side of the mount <[newline]> clicking will cause it to be placed wherever it flew off to
gotenks917#3427: ive noticed a few instances of a panel display not updating when turned on, havent been able to reliably recreate it tho, it happened on a server so it may just be that
commanderguy3001#6660: this is crazy, just the sheer amount of bugs that are found...
Ecconia#4929: Server timestamps.
Funky Egg#5652: If you delete multi button into signers the game will crash
gotenks917#3427: save for collision bug
gnog#2259: me looking at myself
DayDun#2309: also, using `localhost` as the server address doesn't appear to work, while `127.0.0.1` does
DayDun#2309: If you disable discovery, the game seems to crash when you ping the server
Jimmy#8080: Yes, can confirm. Almost everything in LW is rebindable.
PseudoGoose#2841: I think you can? `Mod` is somewhere in the controls and you should be able to rebind it
brennan#3276: I have my Ctrl key mapped to the Caps Lock on the keyboard (SharpKeys).  It is not respected in the game.  It works in all other apps.  Reach for Ctrl forces my hand into a really contorted awkward position.  Would be nice if `Mod` can be mapped to something else.
circuitgamer77#0377: Every time I try to clone a group of sockets with ctrl for alignment the game crashes, and when I load in the next time it reliably stops rendering the board with the components on it and no controls work.  I've been closing it with alt-f4 the second time, and it always loads with the correct result from placing the cloned pieces after that.

Buzz#6223: so that's weird
Buzz#6223: also text kind of just seems to break after a little bit of playing
Buzz#6223: ;p
RyanT#1426: You've found the dreaded floating point rounding error bug
Buzz#6223: because text and the dots on the sockets were glitching out as a result of it, i imagine the board size was too
Buzz#6223: probably a floating point thing, and the effect was amplified by how i have 8 of these slightly thicc boards stacked next to each other
Buzz#6223: this board was copied from somewhere far away from the origin
Buzz#6223: oh i think i know what might have caused this

Jimmy#8080: Please make a bug report with instructions
Pate?#0866: basically switching the amount of inputs and AND gate has bugs the fucker out
Buzz#6223: actually no, it'll repeat the last scroll direction, so right or left depending on how you last scrolled
Buzz#6223: using the scroll wheel to change hotbar item and then left *or* right clicking without first pointing my camera in a different direction will cycle right one hotbar item
Pate?#0866: <@!154964593397989376> I can now reliably replicate the bug
Pate?#0866: it gets worse the more you mess with it
Pate?#0866: and yes
Pate?#0866: ok I got the original bug with as little parts as possible
Pate?#0866: AAAAAAAAAA
Zephi#4594: I can't get into the game, it just loads infinitely and i have to forcefully kill the game to actually escape the loading screen. It complains about permission denied for socket stuff (i tried setting to ipv6 and ipv4, no firewall, running as root, still doesn't work.) (Multiplayer doesn't work either)
Pate?#0866: OH NO
Pate?#0866: that peg isn't even necessary
Pate?#0866: <@!154964593397989376> I did it
Cass#9363: what happened here in order, moved 8 sockets up one, which caused an error. reloaded and placed that visible socket and then everything disappeared except whats here
Jimmy#8080: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Cass#9363: now i have really broken it
Jimmy#8080: I've see this a couple of times now. If you can figure out a way to reliably reproduce it, that would be amazing.
ieee 802.11ac#6337: try setting fov to -1
DustyAngel47#7299: Someone set it to -1
Jimmy#8080: This is correct, I think the default is 5-7 minutes between music. You can tweak this by editing `settings_master.succ`
Michael#8718: No matter what I do, I can't rotate a buffer

MiniStumpy#5653: Sry if it doesn't make sense, I'm tired
MiniStumpy#5653: And I found out it's something wuth the logic api, in Server.cs on line 175
MiniStumpy#5653: I restarted my pc, reinstalled the game
MiniStumpy#5653: Tbh

circuitgamer77#0377: The board is back, but still in the state that caused the problem...  I'm going to back up the world if possible before attempting to remove it.
circuitgamer77#0377: Got an error that caused the game to crash, then reloaded and it appeared to be fixed.  Then I flipped one switch on the board that appeared to fix itself after the crash and every board in the world vanished, with no ability to redo an action.  I alt-f4'd in the hopes that the game would not save the empty world and overwrite my builds so far.  Don't know if it worked yet, but I'm about to reopen the game and check.

PLYSHKA#6201: Very low priority feature maybe compiling .net for arm is feasible?  <[newline]> Running server on PI or something like that sounds awesome (althrough it's quite heavy because it's single-threaded and is using one full core on ryzen 1600)
PLYSHKA#6201: You can't run multiple server on the same machine even if different ports used (probably can be fixed with `BindIp` option in configs to change ip that server uses to bind into)
WildPants#2188: but nothing ever popped up when i started the dedicated server app
WildPants#2188: it fixed when i restarted my computer
WildPants#2188: i tried running the dedicated server app
Nik#1011: how'd you "do" the server?
Nik#1011: any errors?
WildPants#2188: I tried doing the server and now my game will not start
alion02#1973: not sure what's causing it exactly but it's some combination of z, g, ctrl+g, and left click

MiniStumpy#5653: what does deserializing do? I am trying to see what's going on with my copy of LW
Nik#1011: technically you can go into the config files and up the limit. it's to help keep the game playable, as handling huge gigantic ridiculous boards is cumbersome. Also, try to keep this channel to issue discussion please!
Whisper#7076: Ew why is there a max size to circuit boards
FalsePattern#7777: not yet <[newline]> it seems like the game forgets what monitor it was set to
Whisper#7076: It needs a greyed out placeholder of what it's going to place, where you are pointing
Nik#1011: ew. I assume this is a unity bug... have you seen this behavior on other games?
alion02#1973: i can move around tho
alion02#1973: and all circuit boards except for one disappeared
alion02#1973: and my fps tanked
alion02#1973: all interface and all interactions with the world stopped working
alion02#1973: i just broke the game completely
alion02#1973: uh
FalsePattern#7777: temporary workaround is to use windowed/borderless window
FalsePattern#7777: and if the monitor is a different size from the center one, this may happen
FalsePattern#7777: also, another issue i've found: <[newline]>  <[newline]> with multiple monitors (3 or more), if i have logic world set to exclusive fullscreen on any monitor other than the leftmost, then alt+tab out and back in, the game pops up on the leftmost monitor

CrispyPin#1149: grabbing two connected sockets and moving them kicks you from the server and breaks your session

KILLERTK#2092: <@!154964593397989376> My bad, I installed the server wrong, it needs the entire game directory... *derp*
Ecconia#4929: 
Ecconia#4929: 
Nik#1011: yes, but it's referencing the wrong folder right now. you should probably run it from game files instead for now. <[newline]> Also, if you want general LW questions answered, use <#401255675264761868>
MiniStumpy#5653: <@!154964593397989376> Sorry for pinging you, but this may be the thing.
