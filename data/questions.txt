LOOPS#1372: Thank you
GHXX#9078: yeah, type "noclip" in the console
LOOPS#1372: Ay is there a noclip command or something?
circuitgamer77#0377: There's a complete disconnect between logical/social/emotional contexts.
circuitgamer77#0377: Autism problems...
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm just not good at figuring out how other people think, so I don't have a very good distinction between debate/discussion in a normal context.  I know the literal interpretation, but not the social one.
Erikbot#6368: I tend to make a distinction between debate and discussion, where debate contains rethoric/winners/etc and discussing lacks that.
circuitgamer77#0377: I tend to continue arguments past when someone wins - it is very effective at getting more information that I might have missed along the way.  I don't know how other people interpret it though.
Erikbot#6368: It does not divide base 2 evenly so the remainder of the rows are added slower. it will work better with really high bit counts.
Erikbot#6368: for 3/2: 32->22->16->11->8->6->4->3->2->(carry add)
circuitgamer77#0377: By the way, I understand your argument, and mostly agree.  I'm mainly arguing now to get as much information as possible to make sure I understand completely.
Erikbot#6368: for 32 bit, using only 3->2 layers, you would need 8.5 layers, and with carrying adders you need 5 layers. (there is a decimal here since the layers do not cleanly divide the number of rows)
Erikbot#6368: Yes, but you can fit in more adders in the same amount of time. the row reductions this way per adder layer is 2/3, and with instant carry it is 1/2. 2 layers of full non carry propagating adders have the reduction (2/3)*(2/3) = 0.4444... which is less than 1/2.
circuitgamer77#0377: (actually vanishing now)
circuitgamer77#0377: But it isn't instant carry if it's done the LUT way.
Erikbot#6368: some multipliers use groups of 3 rows -> 2 rows with full adders, which decreases the number of rows without requiring carry propagation. you can do 1 tick full adders (3 rows -> 2 rows) in LW without unreasonable number of components with a tiny LUT.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll be back in a bit - I have to walk for about 10 minutes.
circuitgamer77#0377: The carry step is what makes an adder take 2 ticks rather than 1.
circuitgamer77#0377: I know the number of bits to add doesn't decrease, I was just wondering if the operation could be redistributed so the carry steps all happen at the end?
Erikbot#6368: some multipliers work sort of like that, however, the number of bits to finally add together does not decrease that way.
circuitgamer77#0377: I wonder if you could hold the carry to the end of the multiplication (hardware), so each addition step only takes 1 tick, then just add the carry logic overhead to the end?
circuitgamer77#0377: Depending on the available hardware, there would either need to be 8 bit operations, or 8 conditional jumps.
circuitgamer77#0377: I was assuming the number started out spread out, so I was underestimating there.
circuitgamer77#0377: So hardware would take 0 ticks for the shifts,  1 tick for the ANDs, and 2 ticks per layer for the additions.  There would be 3 layers, so 6 ticks for all 3 layers, and 7 ticks overall.  I agree with you there.
Erikbot#6368: you need to conditionally add based on a specific bit in a register, so otherwise you would need several instructions of bit manipulations. (I assume you exclude the loop, although that can be unrolled.)
circuitgamer77#0377: There's an and gate layer too - forgot about that part.  Add another 8 cycles for that.
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know how long one CPU cycle is for this specific cpu, but if it's in the 3-6 tick range it wouldn't be that bad for a CPU that doesn't need to be super fast.
circuitgamer77#0377: Wouldn't necessarily need a branch - there's nothing conditional about it, so it could just be programmed sequentially in memory.  A branch would make it simpler to write though.  It would need 7 bit shifts and 7 additions in total.  So slower than hardware by a moderate amount, but not too bad for 8 bit inputs.
Erikbot#6368: 8 bit: log2(8)= 3 layers -> 3*2+1=7 ticks for hardware. a single software iteration would take several cpu cycles including a branch, which is WAY worse, and you would need 8 of them.
Ecconia#4929: When I get to building a CPU I will try to add as few things as I have to. And whenever additional hardware makes something faster, I will add it. There is no "best instruction set", because it always depends on the use-case. (As there is no best programming language). <[newline]> But I am also curious, if I have to add a hardware multiplier to my systems eventually.
LOOPS#1372: Guess I'll go the software route this time🤷
LOOPS#1372: Okay I gotcha, I guess it comes down to speed at the end of the day, software could also takes input larger than 8 bits if necessary which is a big plus. A 16x16 hardware multiplier would probably be pretty overkill anyhow lol
circuitgamer77#0377: The more input bits on the input with the least bits the bigger the difference between the hardware and software versions.
circuitgamer77#0377: I've made my own version of both the hardware and software versions, so I understand the systems.
circuitgamer77#0377: I know, but only the input bit count matters for the operation time.
moish#6931: The best place to look would be at Minecraft redstone tutorials. Look at: https://youtube.com/c/Mattbatwings. He's the best I've found, and he really takes you from knowing literally nothing about digital logic, to being able to build pretty much anything.
LOOPS#1372: Because the max output there would be 16 bits
LOOPS#1372: Its 16 bits, the multiplier I have takes 2 8 bit inputs
circuitgamer77#0377: Assuming your operations take about twice as long in software as it does in hardware, I would approximate that it is about 8 times slower to do it in software for 8 bits.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think only 10 or 20 times.  You can do bitshift/add for each bit (I think you said 8 bit inputs?), or in hardware you can do it as a tree, which is 3 layers, so in terms of the number of addition layers its only 5 layers left, plus the difference in time between hardware additions and software operations.
LOOPS#1372: I think Hardware multiplication is probably atleast a 100 times faster for something  like 250*250
LOOPS#1372: Yeah it'd be in it's own subroutine if I were to. Before I've just implemented both at the same time, which works okay, might just do that again idk
circuitgamer77#0377: Unless you have simultaneous vector operations, but I'm guessing you don't have that.
circuitgamer77#0377: The subroutine wouldn't be able to do additions in parallel, which is the biggest problem.
circuitgamer77#0377: You can have the subroutine do pretty much the same thing as the hardware, just a bit slower.
circuitgamer77#0377: If you have the capability to jump to subroutines, and you aren't too worried about speed, I would just write a multiplication subroutine rather than make a dedicated multiplier.  If you are concerned about speed and/or can't do subroutines, I would probably make a dedicated multiplier, but getting it to not cause other operations to become slower might be challenging.  The multiplier will be significantly slower than pretty much any other operation.
LOOPS#1372: Repeated addition seems almost prohibitively long
LOOPS#1372: <@261288435392839680> A pretty large amount usually
zandy#3110: idk how much multiplication you gonna be doing? <[newline]>  <[newline]> multiplication is like 4-5 instructions but will take a lot of clock cycles if you just have addition
LOOPS#1372: For a 16-bit computer is a hardware multiplier worth including? Presuming that the inputs are 8 bits each
zandy#3110: jk. kinda. but check out Ben Eater on youtube, that's computer-ish explainations of concepts
zandy#3110: a comp sci bachelor's degree
circuitgamer77#0377: That would explain it :)
binaryclock03#5762: it might have been autocorrect lol. My phone doesnt know what turing is lol
binaryclock03#5762: ope yeah, thanks
circuitgamer77#0377: (was probably a typo, just wanted to avoid confusion)
circuitgamer77#0377: Turing not touring.
binaryclock03#5762: Turing complete is a good introduction to digital logic in general
danny.m#2187: Any good recs for tutorials or beginner projects?  Just installed the game
circuitgamer77#0377: Slower access, but much less wiring.
circuitgamer77#0377: In addition to memory mapped data transfer between CPU and GPU?
circuitgamer77#0377: Dedicated RAM for the GPU to work with?
binaryclock03#5762: 128x128 registers are uhh... Big...
binaryclock03#5762: Now I'm trying to work on the ability to store a sprite sheet in the GPU so I don't need a seperate register for each sprite lol
binaryclock03#5762: :) it's a start!
zandy#3110: dang I gotta step up my game. I'm writing one character to a screen per clock cycle
Arc#5873: yes, component count, don't get me wrong they are super useful!
binaryclock03#5762: hmm I see
circuitgamer77#0377: Component count, I'm assuming?
binaryclock03#5762: why? pegs are so usefull
Arc#5873: tbh I prefer to minimize my use of pegs
Arc#5873: From what I saw in Jimmy's video that makes sense, sounds like an interesting idea!
Ecconia#4929: If it is "any", then yes. You could make a mod, which does nothing more than adding a peg. <[newline]> Because the height of pegs is variable when adding it to a mod.
Arc#5873: hehe good thought but I have figured out something 🙂 Thanks!
Nik#1011: hmm closest I can think of is that panel displays have multiple peg inputs with varried heights. the shortest one might be what you're looking for, assuming you can fit the whole display in your circuit
Arc#5873: ye I wanted even smaller pegs :), I did notice something in one of Jimmy's videos that had very low to the ground pegs in it, so maybe its something that he might add in the future
circuitgamer77#0377: no, but I wish there was.  You can resize mounts, which is the closest thing.
Arc#5873: Is there a way to reduce the height of pegs?
binaryclock03#5762: (although dividing can take much longer 😭 )
binaryclock03#5762: (my cpu operates at 10 ingame ticks per cycle)
binaryclock03#5762: Essentially mine can do very basic operations on large amounts of data (and, or, not kinda things) (64 bits at a time). Its also got really fast memory that can output 64 bits at a time and some really good bitshifters. It stores sprites in its ram and can display them at a pixel position on a 128x128 screen in less then a cpu cycle
circuitgamer77#0377: I still haven't really worked on GPUs...  I've made some very basic graphics circuits, but nothing that would really be useful.
binaryclock03#5762: ic
circuitgamer77#0377: I designed my Minecraft CPU to have each register include a shift left or right option, but I could get away with that because it needed that many components anyway - I just had to move them around.
binaryclock03#5762: hmm I need to work on my gpu again... but class 😭
binaryclock03#5762: if you're using 4 word instructions
binaryclock03#5762: yeah true
binaryclock03#5762: that way in a single line of instructions you'd be able to do 3 single word operations
circuitgamer77#0377: Could be useful, although I think it would considerably increase the number of components overall.
binaryclock03#5762: I was just thinking in my next architecture I kinda want to have registers that can do any single byte op, like not, shift, etc...
circuitgamer77#0377: I would need to look it up
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't really know though
binaryclock03#5762: yeah
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't think so - I think most are just single memory units, with a separate circuit for shifting.  Shift registers are great for external chips for IO though.
binaryclock03#5762: are registers in cpus usually shift registers?
circuitgamer77#0377: Sounds kind of JK latch/flip-flop to me, but my guess is that it has differently organized inputs.
elblorenz32#4966: but I can't quite see the toggleability in an rs latch
elblorenz32#4966: well.. the thing I created works as a T-Flip-Flop but can be set and reset at the same time
Fabada El Conquistador#4885: okay thanks
Erikbot#6368: not in a reasonable amount of components per bit, a lookup table can be made 1 tick, but that needs O(2^n) components.
Fabada El Conquistador#4885: is there any 2 tick substractor?
Erikbot#6368: rs latch
elblorenz32#4966: is there a name for an r/s flip-flop?
Ecconia#4929: One can multi select one row or more and then copy the selection to place more than one. Makes it much faster already.
circuitgamer77#0377: There's a few tutorials on it available, but I don't have the links.
circuitgamer77#0377: Multiconnect - hold ctrl while dragging across multiple pins, and use the scroll wheel to set a spacing.  (ctrl is the default - it may be different if you changed that binding)
Foxer#0359: Is there a way to connect multiple wires at the same time?
circuitgamer77#0377: Not a the moment.  I think multiplace might be coming in 0.91?
Foxer#0359: I am trying to make a wall of displays; Is there a way to place multiple at once? This is very tedious.
Dragon Lord#6944: the custom avatar update should be called the hatching update lol
Chime#3134: so... there are DRAGONS but the players are all little balls.  Is that what we hatch into?   😄
GCMwasco#8049: Much appreciated! I'll check him out
circuitgamer77#0377: I always suggest Ben Eater on YT, but other people can give you some other resources.  Most of his videos are more complicated systems, but he does have a few on basic adders and logic in general.
GCMwasco#8049: I'm a pretty amateur programmer which I know has very little to do with logic circuitry, so my question is... Where's the best place to learn about this? I know google is a great resource, but I figure some of you guys and gals might know which resources are better than others
Ecconia#4929: This playlist contains like most LW videos on YouTube, also some tutorials. Maybe you find something interesting. <[newline]> `Logic Alligator` and `Michael Bauers` (second made some for memory). <[newline]> <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv5AvL0n1CyRBloxHA5FCVMOBm4rrBCW2>
DanielGJ44#4557: lol
!Chips#4890: ok ty
!Chips#4890: oooh it's april first
DanielGJ44#4557: Or at least previously discussed, I'm sure it'll be a hot topic
DanielGJ44#4557: Change system date - currently being discussed in <#401255675264761868>
!Chips#4890: How do i make them go awayyyy
DanielGJ44#4557: LOL
!Chips#4890: I am so startled, why are there hundreds of dragon in my world doing bad wario impressions, I assume this a new update?
BitorBit#6268: if you want i could help you
Aszriel#3004: Is there anyone that did some youtube tutorial on logic world about how to make a memory cell or anything related to hardware ?
circuitgamer77#0377: 0.91 - "The Great Update" :)
Jimmy#8080: That's the plan haha!
elblorenz32#4966: I see, so 0.91 will be great!
Jimmy#8080: Unfortunately we had to cut that feature from 0.90, but it is coming back for 0.91 :)
elblorenz32#4966: k thx, this is what I've done till now
GHXX#9078: not to my knowledge, but you can copy paste, essentially cutting it down to log2(N) copy actions where N is the number of buttons you have in the end
elblorenz32#4966: is there a way to fill an area with, e.g. levers, at once? (as in one of the LWW videos) or is this 0.91?
BitorBit#6268: xd
BitorBit#6268: i changed command to "tg"
Ecconia#4929: It would have taken me some time too. But your conversation made me get this idea. And I talk with Bitor a bit more, so one learns to think around  the corner :P
Ecconia#4929: I  general just smash 'help' in console. And if it's my mod, just check out my git. I try to document things okayish.
BitorBit#6268: found it
BitorBit#6268: and ecconia, where is the command for disable collision
circuitgamer77#0377: Thank you for taking over <@!151293812675706880> , I was very confused :)
Ecconia#4929: Yep
BitorBit#6268: so simulation needs to be at 10,000tps to be 0.5
Ecconia#4929: No 0.05kHz
BitorBit#6268: so that is 0.5khz
BitorBit#6268: y
circuitgamer77#0377: Was about to ask that :)
Ecconia#4929: Do you mean that the computer needs 20 ticks for one cycle/instruction? <[newline]> Then you can just divide 1000/20, and get 50Hz
BitorBit#6268: i think i need to do (1000tps/20tps)/100
BitorBit#6268: 1000tps simulation speed
BitorBit#6268: 20 tps computer speed
circuitgamer77#0377: 1khz
circuitgamer77#0377: 20tps in a 1000tps simulation is 1000tps...  I don't know what you're trying to figure out
BitorBit#6268: so its running 0.02khz?
BitorBit#6268: i am building a pc that is running on 20tps, but i need to know how fast it is in 1000tps simulation
circuitgamer77#0377: That would be subtracting them, which isn't something I would think would be very useful in most cases...
circuitgamer77#0377: ?
BitorBit#6268: so 0.98khz?
circuitgamer77#0377: 2%
circuitgamer77#0377: 20/1000 = 2/100 = 1/50
BitorBit#6268: and how much is 20 out of 1000?
circuitgamer77#0377: They're the same unit - 1tps = 1hz
circuitgamer77#0377: 20tps would be 20hz, or 0.02khz, and 1000tps would be 1000 hz, or 1khz.
BitorBit#6268: how much is 20tps in 1000tps simulation to khz?
elblorenz32#4966: there it is
elblorenz32#4966: I think this question got a yes earlier this month, so yeah
BitorBit#6268: will 0.91 update have save/load circuts so we can load and save them into diferent worlds?
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm using the configurable one for my RAM (and probably a modified version in my register file) to allow for 1 tick reads/writes
GHXX#9078: nice trick
GHXX#9078: i see
circuitgamer77#0377: Here's the two versions of the circuit - the configurable one and the low component count one (the low component count one matches 0011, but can be made differently for different patterns):
GHXX#9078: so you set the input and one tick later you have the output?
circuitgamer77#0377: There's the less components but not configurable design, or there's the version I'm using that is more components but allows 1 tick matching of the opposite input (but that one is slow, so it should be pretty static).
circuitgamer77#0377: I need to load the game...
circuitgamer77#0377: I learned it from someone else, but I don't remember who
circuitgamer77#0377: I can show you the design if you want
circuitgamer77#0377: Yep
GHXX#9078: can you even make a 1 tick lookup table if you do not have inverted inputs ontop of the normal inputs?
circuitgamer77#0377: So I know there's no design for a 1 tick adder that isn't an unusably large lookup table, but could there be a design that takes one input one tick later than the other, and have the shorter one be 1 tick?
Ecconia#4929: Oh no, I was Dumbo to not check it. Very epic!
circuitgamer77#0377: You could also make a keyboard interface program by hand-assembling some instructions, then write a basic assembler by hand, then have your in-game CPU compile the programs for itself.  That's what I'm intending to do, once I finish my current CPU.  Do whatever you think will be the best for your playstyle though :)
Thriven#6230: Alright, I'll point him in that direction when he gets around to it
Dragon Lord#6944: there are mods that include ROM components that you can write a set of instructions to from your pc, which would allow you to assemble and flash your cpu from your real pc.
Dragon Lord#6944: you'll have to assemble it to byte code and write the code manually at the moment (if you don't use mods)
Dragon Lord#6944: oh, i see what you mean
Thriven#6230: Does LW have any type of assembly/machine code parser in it? He seems to spend hours tinkering on making CPU's. I'm kind of pushing him into cutting back the time he spends building CPU's and do more circuit board design but he seems very apprehensive to start coding.
Dragon Lord#6944: if you're trying to make a pre-existing asm run on the cpu, you'll need to assemble it to that cpu (assuming it has the same instruction set as is used in the original, or can be modified automatically to use only commands available on your system)
Dragon Lord#6944: he could make his own assembly language if needed
Thriven#6230: So I've been helping a friends kid who has gotten super into Logic World. He's making very simple CPU's with multiple instructions. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Is there a way to pass assembly to be parsed and executed against his CPUs? I've told him he'll probably need to redesign his CPU to match a spec like the 6502.
GHXX#9078: private testing <a:CS_eyesshaking:717429589810610287>
Jimmy#8080: 
Jimmy#8080: Not only is it possible, we're already doing it 😄
Ecconia#4929: It would be amazing if we also could have that with the upcoming LW releases. Like for example one beta for 0.90.3. <[newline]> Its quite the main version. And allows us to go back to load older saves, or experience the game in an older state. <[newline]> (Ofc downgrading may come with a corrupted game-folder. But this is the idea.) <[newline]> (I am not sure if Steam has some constrains there though). <[newline]> I will try to save all LW versions locally regardless. But it would be cool anyway. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Oh this is in <#901199821212352573>, so my question is, what do you think about this, could it be possible?
Ecconia#4929: Hi <@!154964593397989376>, <[newline]> I was just looking at older versions of Factorio, and they have them in the Steam Beta system:
circuitgamer77#0377: This is just me being curious - does anyone know of a single-pass lossless compression algorithm?  I might try to make it in LW if it exists...
Riku#9814: Alright cool
HomelikeBrick42#1173: its going to be in `0.91`
Riku#9814: I forget, was the ability to save boards added in yet? I thought I remember seeing an announcement about it, but I might be wrong.
elblorenz32#4966: is there any update date (orientation) yet?
Erikbot#6368: this one is 2 tick ICA,  1 wide tileable: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/942342740665061396 (although pretty tall)
Tixo_Moments#3697: what's the smallest design?
Tixo_Moments#3697: I need a compact stackable full adder
circuitgamer77#0377: At some point I'm planning on implementing something like an IRL keyboard interface - send sequential keycodes to a buffer, with key releases sent as a release code immediately before the keycode to release.
elblorenz32#4966: ok, I got it now... problem: do not press too many buttons a once (I'll just set it up, that it doesn't work then [not schure how to handle shift and ctrl tho...])
circuitgamer77#0377: Just thought I would mention it just in case :)
elblorenz32#4966: thx though
elblorenz32#4966: well, man-machine input doesn't need to be fast...
circuitgamer77#0377: Use fast buffers if you want it to be instant but bigger.
elblorenz32#4966: let's hope that doesn't change...
elblorenz32#4966: oh, wait... there are one directional wires...
elblorenz32#4966: well... I have a keyboard layout mapped in a way, so every row and column is combined into a single pin... I have 27 pins in total but only 16 bit of memory (also only 16 bit of address [modded ram gate]) <[newline]> the problem is, that wires aren't one-directional, so my previous design just didn't work (run multiple wires to the same pin on the ram) <[newline]>  <[newline]> My goal: somehow use these 27 pins in a 16 bit address on a ROM-like memory
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't have enough information to help yet.
circuitgamer77#0377: Are you trying to make a decoder/encoder?
circuitgamer77#0377: I just don't know what you mean by map in this case.  Are you trying to encode individual inputs into a 16 bit word, or something else?
elblorenz32#4966: any way but I don't want to use so many buffers/gates
circuitgamer77#0377: In what way?  There are a lot of ways to map one set of bits to another.
elblorenz32#4966: how do you map 27 inputs to 16 bits easily?
SenseiPete#8797: I love the fact that this guy just tool controls and features from MC
SenseiPete#8797: nvm just realized it works like WE lmao
SenseiPete#8797: like go on top u dumb thing!
SenseiPete#8797: is there an easy way to copy a circuit board ontop of itself without having to place the board first and then copy over the modules on it after?
elblorenz32#4966: oh, cause I thought that the chip-select lines were bundled, so you can use them like an address bus <[newline]>  <[newline]> but that seems to make more sense now <[newline]> THX
Ecconia#4929: It sure is possible to have smaller and multiple data buses. <[newline]> In my CPU draft I am using such a system too. <[newline]> Normally chip-select lines (afaik), are not included in the bus, because the bus goes everywhere, while CS and similar control signals only go from ControlUnit to specific chip.
elblorenz32#4966: When you think of a Computer, there is always only one data bus, but is it possible (IRL) for the computer (or CPU) to have multiple (maybe shorter/smaller) data buses <[newline]>  <[newline]> Also, is are chip select lines integrated into the control bus? <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]> Cause I want to build a computer that can work with assembly language...
jaalte#8572: so they're more like world savefiles than prefabs?
jaalte#8572: cool, thx
Jimmy#8080: <@!117882488881283079> You have to extract the folder and drop it in the game's `saves` folder, which is next to the game executable. We are working on one-click integration, so you'll click a button on the website and the game will automatically start up and download the creation.
jaalte#8572: how do you import stuff from the logic world hub?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: they seem to be pretty much what i described
HomelikeBrick42#1173: i didnt know about serial cpus
HomelikeBrick42#1173: oh ok
Dragon Lord#6944: definitely! you could use a serial cpu to achieve that with very few parts
HomelikeBrick42#1173: i know this *is* be possible because of turing completeness but im wondering whether this is feasible in lw <[newline]> could you make a cpu that works on arbitrary sized integers (a size specified by each instruction)? <[newline]> like add, subtract, move, whatever
Erikbot#6368: If you want lots of specifics you will probably have to start reading research papers.
Erikbot#6368: The CPU and cache are on the same circuit, to improve performance, but the cache itself typically operates independently of the CPU, but where the CPU begins and ends is kind of subjective. In modern CPU:s, stuff is done out of order if a cache miss occurs and eventually it just stalls the pipeline.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23448528/how-is-an-lru-cache-implemented-in-a-cpu
binaryclock03#5762: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache
binaryclock03#5762: I think there is a lot more function to it, but thats one that I know of
binaryclock03#5762: in LW where everything is essentially flash memory it doesn't really make that much sense to have I think other then the realism part of it. When you can access your cache at the same speed as your disk it doesnt really make a difference I think
binaryclock03#5762: I think one of the purposes of it is when the cpu request info from a disk it takes a bit for the disk to send the data over, so its sent to the cache while the CPU does other stuff in the mean time and then once its all sent to the cache the cpu loads stuff into registers, does stuff, puts it back to cache and then from the cache it goes back to the disk
binaryclock03#5762: Isnt cache like a thing that goes between  ram and the cpu, as well as the cpu and disk?
circuitgamer77#0377: This is somewhere between a LW question and a general CPU question - does anyone have a good resource for the actual implementation of caches?  I understand the idea, and a lot of the organization, but not what controls the caches or how it's controlled.  Is is controlled by the actual CPU cores directly, or is it a separate circuit that somehow interacts with the cores?  I haven't been able to find this kind of low-level explanation.
elblorenz32#4966: awesome thanks <[newline]> idk why I didn't try that first
Justin#2534: First grab the board with default G, then hit your delete key, default D
elblorenz32#4966: well it doesn't... <[newline]>  <[newline]> I can move or clone the board but if I try to delete it, it gets denied (makes that sound too) <[newline]> and... I don't want to remove the same board about 10 times piece by piece (yes, I have made some duplicates)
Flampt#3906: Just delete the board
Flampt#3906: subcomponents ?
elblorenz32#4966: is there a way to select / remove all subcomponents of a selected board?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think re-root is planned for some time in the future, but I can't say for sure
Arc#5873: Thanks!
circuitgamer77#0377: You can't re-root, but you can use shift+rotate to change the side it connects from.
Arc#5873: in KSP you can 're-root' the assemblage of parts so another part becomes what connects it to the rest of the structure, which is something else that would be cool to have.
Arc#5873: is there a way to change the side that a circuit board thats been cloned/moved connects its self with, I guess its the root of the part/board (similar to kerbal space program)

BRUNOX#7033: How can i make a server for playing with my friend?
circuitgamer77#0377: Can't voice chat at the moment, and I don't have LW on my laptop, but I'm basically thinking of using pairs of relays as a SPDT-ish switch for manually configuring addresses on a different system, (that would be using the one-tick decoding), with one relay on each switch enabling/disabling the relay for that bit, and the other one disabling/enabling the NOT gate for that bit, so I can encode addresses by switch rather than hardwiring.  The reason I'm asking about performance is that all of the data would go to every address for decoding every time, and all of the data has to go through a relay before being decoded, so if there's a performance penalty for sending data through a relay it would have a giant impact on the overall performance.
Ecconia#4929: I think the simulation overhead only happens when the values of the linked clusters changes. <[newline]> And then it is currently pretty much a blackbox how exactly the simulation does the link-layer (did not bother looking into the code yet). <[newline]> But if you do not intend to run the simulation at CPU limit, it does not matter anyway. <[newline]> Can you describe it a bit more how you want to use the relays, I am bad with understanding that. Or just make an image. We could voice chat.
circuitgamer77#0377: I was trying to decide whether or not using manually switched relays to select a value that never changes would be fast to simulate, in this case.  So if I understand correctly, adding those relays, even if they never switch, could have an impact on the sim still?
Ecconia#4929: The wire connected to the side inputs of a relay barely has any effect on the simulation. You can change its states very often. <[newline]> Closing or Opening a relay also is quite cheap on the simulation. <[newline]> This is because the relay only links two clusters with each other. <[newline]> However the linkage of two clusters is not that cheap, as in, sending data over the "phasic" link takes more effort. <[newline]> And I can imagine that the more clusters you link with each other in chain the more overhead you get.
circuitgamer77#0377: Basically wondering if a relay is treated as a wire when it isn't changing state, or if the signal is still processed by something.
circuitgamer77#0377: Quick question on the simulation - if a relay stays open or closed, does a signal attempting to go through the relay cost any additional sim time?  I know that switching is not particularly fast in comparison to normal gates, but I don't know about the other signal.
BRUNOX#7033: Ok!
Ecconia#4929: You wait for update 0.91. <[newline]> This feature got removed from early access (due to previous refactoring), but will make it back in the next update.
BRUNOX#7033: How i can save boards in macOS?

Ecconia#4929: Oh that might have several reasons. <[newline]> For starters, which type of error does he get? `Connection timed out`?
crypto#3170: that was the article i was referring to and idk if my friend is joining wrong but it just wont let him join

GHXX#9078: make sure the ipmode is set to v4 and make sure you forwarded the oort properly
Nik#1011: (this chat is best suited for single questions. I'm not sure how many volunteers this server would have to guide you through the whole process unfortunately)
Nik#1011: if you have any more specific questions or troubles when following that process though, feel free to ask here.

pilonpl#4015: But often
pilonpl#4015: Not always
pilonpl#4015: Imo, you just have to remember what shortenings mean
Justin#2534: That's what I was trying to convey
GHXX#9078: imo understanding abbreviations intuitively has more to do with language understanding and experience rather than nativeness. <[newline]> But being a native speaker sortof implies a good understanding of the language.
pilonpl#4015: I know lol
Justin#2534: Native English means English was the first language you were taught
pilonpl#4015: I don't think it has anything to do with nativeness lol
Justin#2534: That being said don't look at my GitHub I'm the worst at shortening 🙈
Justin#2534: A lot of common shortenings are obvious only to native English speakers and experienced programmers
circuitgamer77#0377: inInt is one of the few names where I let myself use capital 'I', because I don't like that it can look like lowercase 'l'.
circuitgamer77#0377: or inInt, inChar, inBool, or inDouble.
circuitgamer77#0377: A common input for me in Java is "instr", for input string.
circuitgamer77#0377: I know when I program, I tend to abbreviate slightly for common things like str for string and i and j for loops, and k and l for more nested loops or for paired nonspecific values (like values in a tuple class in Java or structure in C).  I write most other variable names as the shortest I can get without abbreviating or losing clarity.  It's nice to have short names for programming speed (it takes forever to type long variable names over and over), but I always want to avoid losing details.
BitorBit#6268: why did all of the servers died, only ecconia's servers are still running
Verlio_H#0201: haha ed with all 1 letter commands go brrr

DanielGJ44#4557: Emoji, even
Verlio_H#0201: jimmy should rename all settings to a singular, unique unicode character
DanielGJ44#4557: Not sure about dedicated computer science/programming undergraduate programs but that's been a standard no-no for my 4 years thus far
DanielGJ44#4557: And we get marks docked for not making it a descriptive name
DanielGJ44#4557: Re: single letter variable names, we are specifically taught not to do that
Jimmy#8080: Lmao
DanielGJ44#4557: There should be a setting for long setting names
DanielGJ44#4557: but I respect making it humanly readable
DanielGJ44#4557: I feel like "LimitSliderRange" would more succinctly describe it
Jimmy#8080: IMO, one should never sacrifice clarity for the sake of brevity. This is apparently an unpopular opinion among programmers, given how often I see single-letter variable names in code. (What the fuck is `l`?)
Jimmy#8080: Yeah I'd rather spend an extra 0.5 seconds reading than an extra 10 minutes trying to figure out what the thing is :)
GHXX#9078: but, its descriptive :)
Verlio_H#0201: long setting name lets go
Jimmy#8080: <@!314766287853191169> Open `settings_master.succ` and change `LogicSettings.Secret.AllowManuallySettingSliderValuesOutOfRange` to `true`. This will allow you to type whatever number you want in the box, even if it's beyond the slider maximum.

BitorBit#6268: you disable all colisions while in game with console
BitorBit#6268: no
PseudoGoose#2841: That only disables colliders while the game is loading
BitorBit#6268: called "disable colision" or something
BitorBit#6268: ecconia made one
BitorBit#6268: yes
Nik#1011: there exists a mod for this?
BitorBit#6268: with a mod yes
Nik#1011: cool idea tho..
Nik#1011: not currently an existing feature, no
Cero#0516: Is it also possible to turn off the clipping verifier from the console?
PseudoGoose#2841: one way is editing the world file directly, you can set the positions to basically whatever you want and the game won't care until you try to move it ingame
Cero#0516: lol how do you clip
Saltypretzel#0321: 1 by 1 cpu when
Ecconia#4929: Yeah like I am already feeling mixed with the amount of finished CPUs and typewriters in that channel, and this thing is only a counter. <[newline]> (Why eat "bruh" ingredients, when with a little effort you can eat the tasty cake? *Here Linux cake, compile(bake) it yourself!*)
Erikbot#6368: Put it in <#901195561980543007>
Ecconia#4929: Good morning, here is my committed sin: <[newline]> (Well no that you saw this, more like bad morning...) <[newline]>  <[newline]> People, requesting wires to clip through things: "This is easy to understand mate!"
BitorBit#6268: looks very normal to me, i dont see anything wrong with it
Ecconia#4929: And remember, clipping is bad for health and environment. So don't do it. <[newline]> Warning, dark humor: ||Studies have shown that it also is one of the causes for cancer - in this case eye cancer.|| <[newline]> Luckily one cannot find rotate 2-wide components, cause then it would just be one massive block. <[newline]> (Now one public server has this abomination, and it is not mine - why would I pollute my drives :P) <[newline]>  <[newline]> Edit (Actually, I think I know how to make this smaller, but that is for the next morning)
Ecconia#4929: An adder which makes use of 3D space and is either 2 or 1 wide per bit. (They must fit their environment).
Cero#0516: So, this
Cero#0516: Also, I don't think you can undo wire cuts anymore cause it's not working \:)
Cero#0516: That's what I thought ok
PseudoGoose#2841: (which is a bug)
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah i think if you undo it it doesn't do a collision check
PseudoGoose#2841: ohhh that
Cero#0516: He clips a wire through a XOR gate
Cero#0516: No what is this https://youtu.be/xZ1APJei2rc?t=305

Cero#0516: wait wtf is wire clipping what
Cero#0516: What do you all consider a small full adder?
circuitgamer77#0377: To me those colors are barely different, but I can see the difference.
LOOPS#1372: Randomizing colors is a good idea, smoke is a definitely too. Thanks
Erikbot#6368: the colors look good, but I think colors should be randomized a bit in the red-orange-yellow spectrum. the oracle might make it easy to implement. add some smoke if you want it to be really fancy.
LOOPS#1372: Colorblind, are these colors okay for a spinning fireball?
Green Nicer#6792: the only thing i did is I bought the game and started it no more no less
Cero#0516: ok
Cero#0516: frick
Biggycheese69420#4947: I don't think there is.
Cero#0516: Is there anyway to AND some socketed bits without re-spreading them
Ecconia#4929: It helps debugging, if we know what you did right before getting that error. <[newline]> I would bluntly guess: You tried to join single player, but the internal server crashed. <[newline]> In this case, there might be an error in the log files. Especially if the log-level is set to `trace`. <[newline]> There are also several cases where your network is the issue (like using a University/School network has negative effects). Windows brings along issues too. <[newline]> So knowing these might help.
PseudoGoose#2841: try verifying the game files? https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB
PseudoGoose#2841: converted to hex, that's E0434352 - ".NET CLR exception" <[newline]> unfortunately it seems like a really generic error code, hard to tell what's causing it
Green Nicer#6792: say what can i do if theres an ERROR code -532462766
circuitgamer77#0377: You can't weld boards, if that's what you're asking.  You can attach more copies of that board to the side to expand it though, which is what I do.
sybergoosejr#8256: Just about. Tested my pc today and did some upgrades. Will probably have server back up this weekend
Cero#0516: Wanna tile this
Cero#0516: wdym started out as some strips
circuitgamer77#0377: No unfortunatly, unless it started out as a bunch of strips in the first place.  What I usually do is duplicate the whole board, then delete everything that isn't on the part I want to keep, then just tile that new board.  It produces problems with floating point errors, but that should be resolved in the next update.
Cero#0516: Is it possible to duplicate a strip of the board and merge it
Cero#0516: oop, v
Cero#0516: How do I edit the size of a board
Cero#0516: nevermind
Cero#0516: Ohhhh
Cero#0516: How do sockets work?
Justin#2534: Yeah I built my first two or three on the ground, but now all my circuits are on boards with socket IOs 😁
PseudoGoose#2841: just place the board first
Cero#0516: Ok
PseudoGoose#2841: when you multi-select and grab it, you can place it on a board
Cero#0516: Like, rebuild it on a board?
PseudoGoose#2841: oh yeah so, you have to put it on a board first
Cero#0516: 
Cero#0516: It's uploading smh
Cero#0516: sure
PseudoGoose#2841: can you share a screenshot of what you're trying to grab?
Cero#0516: Cool, thanks
PseudoGoose#2841: 1 sec
Cero#0516: I already have something I want to move fyi
Cero#0516: How do I do that
Cero#0516: So I just shove it under?
PseudoGoose#2841: you can use a board or a mount (which are also resizable) to lift it
PseudoGoose#2841: yea it can't be floating, it has to be placed on something
Cero#0516: How do I move something up? Like I multi-select something, and I want to move it into the air, is that not a thing?
potato lord#1969: I have a record yes
Ecconia#4929: <@!247449046615064577> how are you doing? <[newline]> Life stable again?

potato lord#1969: It was on the AIY server
circuitgamer77#0377: Do you have a screenshot of his circuit?
Ecconia#4929: I was answering in his place.
circuitgamer77#0377: I was asking <@!246400262992822273> , but can I see the circuit you're talking about?
Ecconia#4929: Yes
circuitgamer77#0377: Is it modular?
potato lord#1969: I have a 2 tick subtractor somewhere
Ecconia#4929: The problem with LookUpTable here, is that the thing internally does have carry propagation. So it might be one, but for that is is actually way too complex. *shrug*
circuitgamer77#0377: Breaking news: Time travel discovered through the game "Logic World".  Scientists are perplexed, and have no idea why it works, but it seems to be functional.  Nobody knows the dangers associated with this form of time travel, however hopes are high that this could be a great contribution to science!
Ecconia#4929: Imagine you could use negative delays. And if you mess up and make a loop or never terminate your circuit back into presence, the universe just dies.
Erikbot#6368: ~~negative time delayers.~~
circuitgamer77#0377: At this point I've gotten the entire 2 tick subtractor circuit to a state where I could make it work if I had NC relays...  Unfortunately, I don't think it's possible to make a modular 2 tick subtractor without them, which is bothering me now...  Just having a setting on the relay to select whether it's NO or NC would be perfect.
circuitgamer77#0377: With the second input of the XOR being the value to match
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm using XOR gates all tied into one NOT.
Erikbot#6368: 2 tick decoders are MUCH more performant (assuming you are using and gates) and easier to build.
circuitgamer77#0377: For smaller decoders it's very useful.
circuitgamer77#0377: I see.  That's very good to know - I've been working under the assumption that 2 tick decoders were the fastest
Erikbot#6368: you can reduce the number of rows somewhat with a karno map, however addition/subtraction contains the nightmare that is the xor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map
Erikbot#6368: lets say you have a row that you want to be active on some number. the bits that are off get connected to a nor gate (constructed with fast buffers and an inverter). the output is then connected to a chain of relays. the top of the relays get connected with the bits you want to be on. the output of the relay chain will be on after 1 tick on the specific number.
circuitgamer77#0377: Also, how would you make a 1 tick LUT?  The fastest I can get is 2 ticks.
circuitgamer77#0377: Ok...  That's what I'm trying to avoid :)  (I know you know that, I just wanted to say it to be clearer)
Erikbot#6368: it is a LUT in every normal sense of the word, but the definition of a LUT is vauge enough that Ecconia can say that a circuit is technically not a LUT and claim victory. it is not modular and requires exponentially increasing component count for each extra bit O(2^n).
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't fully understand what you mean - is it modular, just not a lookup table, or does it require an exponentially increasing number of components for an increasing number of bits?
GUMMYCAT#6001: found it https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234106526_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_MODIFIED_LOW-POWER_88_SIGNED_DADDA_MULTIPLIER
Ecconia#4929: I do not know. Since I never succeeded in building one. <[newline]> But that is on my TODO list. I could once I have on figure it out.
Erikbot#6368: is it better than O(2^n)?
Ecconia#4929: No, and that was not one of your criteria. You merely asked for the possibility of a 2 tick subtractor. And the answer is clearly yes. 🙂 <[newline]> (Component count is probably somehow exponentially with bit-width.)
GUMMYCAT#6001: I'll have to find it again. It doesn't require much of an increase in hardware which is nice
Erikbot#6368: but it's not O(n) for number of components right?
Ecconia#4929: No. It is not a look up table. It is just complex 😄 <[newline]> (1-tick decoder logic - yay)
Erikbot#6368: you can do sign extension at every stage and invert both input if the "control" input is negative. but that would not be a wallace tree multiplier (this is probably the fastest possible in a reasonable amount of components). **what paper did you use?**
Erikbot#6368: but the 1 tick adder is a LUT...
circuitgamer77#0377: I know but I want to change his mind on this one...  I'm not expecting to succeed, but I might as well mention use cases when I find them.
Ecconia#4929: Yes it is possible. Just use a 1 tick adder as base.
Saltypretzel#0321: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/709250971557036164 said no lol
circuitgamer77#0377: That or a nitrogen-carbon compound, which sounds a bit unstable...
circuitgamer77#0377: Sounds useful...  :)
Verlio_H#0201: me when north carolina relay
circuitgamer77#0377: I think if we had NC relays it would allow for 2 tick subtraction to work, maybe...  there's one catch, but I think there's a workaround.
circuitgamer77#0377: I can't think of an alternitive...  I still think normally-closed relays would be a great addition to the base game - it's not like adding an xnor or something where it's just a condensed version of multiple gates - a relay IRL doesn't have to be any more complicated if it's NC or NO.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm thinking it might be impossible because there are no normally closed relays...
circuitgamer77#0377: I can easily make a 3 tick version, but I want to make it 2 ticks.
circuitgamer77#0377: If someone has a design already don't tell me how you did it - I want to figure it out if it's possible.
circuitgamer77#0377: Does anyone think it's possible to build a dedicated subtractor that operates in 2 ticks like a fast adder that is modular (because I know it can be done as a giant lookup table in 2 ticks, but I want to avoid that)?
GUMMYCAT#6001: nvm, found a paper that works.
nddragoon#2799: great, i think that does the trick
nddragoon#2799: oh is that what those are for
Justin#2534: As far as stopping back propagation from effecting things
Justin#2534: Buffers and fast buffers are super useful for this. I had a lot of problems with this and the solution was usually more buffers
nddragoon#2799: are there plans for a diode or dedicated OR gate? i run into some issues with pegs with cables back-powering others when using pegs
GUMMYCAT#6001: how would you make a wallace tree multiplier work on signed twos complement numbers?

Pedro Martineli#5700: Ah ok, thanks.
PseudoGoose#2841: If you have a program counter that stores its value in a D latch, you need to add a "multiplexer" circuit to the D latch inputs, to choose between the incremented value and an external input

PseudoGoose#2841: Yeah every time you turn it on it generates a random bit. And then when the input is off it resets the output off
waistlan[SFA, flyingfreak]#3857: so just turn it on and off a whole bunch?
PseudoGoose#2841: When you turn the input on, there is a 50% chance the output will turn on.
waistlan[SFA, flyingfreak]#3857: how does the oracle work?
Pedro Martineli#5700: how can i make a programmable program counter?
Erikbot#6368: for general info about CPU design I recommend "computer architecture and organization by David Patterson" (an actual textbook). I treat jal and jalr basically the same, PC gets sent to registers and the jump address gets sent to the PC module that sets the PC. The pipeline is cleared when a jump is performed. On conditional jumps, the pipeline is bubbled so that there is enough time to decide whether to jump. I stopped working on my pipelined CPU because I realized that the client probably would not be able to handle it very well, so now I am going to absurd lengths to reduce component count while still supporting a ton of operations.
GUMMYCAT#6001: I know your cpu is pipelined, how do you do jal and jalr? Info on branching would be nice too, not to confident in my implementation.
Dragon Lord#6944: ~~ime~~
Erikbot#6368: yeah, it feels absurd how much circuitry is just managing stuff other than doing actual computation in a CPU.
GUMMYCAT#6001: incrementor*
GUMMYCAT#6001: in a way i have two adders for my pc, though one is just a decrementor, an adder for pc+1 and an adder for pc+imm, but it was only pc+imm and that was where i got my jump address.
PseudoGoose#2841: it has a dedicated adder for relative jump and for branch (since the branch instructions need the ALU to do a comparison)
PseudoGoose#2841: Oh, I do also have a separate adder for PC
GUMMYCAT#6001: i had a seperate adder for generating the new pc, but i ran into problems with what goose is saying, i started rebuilding everything and now its a mess of wires, not sure where to start.
PseudoGoose#2841: with the JALR instruction, you are adding an immediate to a register (not PC) for the new PC value. Since the ALU is already wired up to do that it makes sense to just use the ALU to compute the new PC value.
Erikbot#6368: another way is to have a separate adder for the PC, so that you can pipe 0+PC to your ALU to write to a register.
GUMMYCAT#6001: yea, routing is a complete mess, no matter how i clean it up, always looks crazy
PseudoGoose#2841: ah, well timing&routing that will be interesting. Eventually I'll have to solve it too, once I add pipelining 😩
GUMMYCAT#6001: i dont have a main bus, all pipelined so there are large registers in place
PseudoGoose#2841: or, put PC on the main bus and make a dedicated line for the ALU output to the PC
PseudoGoose#2841: personally I'm probably going to route it directly from PC to registers, it doesn't have to be part of the entire bus if it's only used for that specific purpose
PseudoGoose#2841: which means a fourth bus word
PseudoGoose#2841: and at the same time, you have to route the PC to registers for the "link" part ^
GUMMYCAT#6001: im also writing the next pc at the instruction into a destination register
PseudoGoose#2841: the way I'm implementing it is just using the ALU. Load rs1, load immediate to the other input, and then send that to PC as an absolute jump
GUMMYCAT#6001: having trouble implementing a Jalr instruction, realized my hardware for generating the next pc is lacking. wondering if anyone knows some good info on the hardware allowing that instruction to work. cant find anything
Arc#5873: Thankyou, that works nicely 🙂 love the game by the way, the editor is so intuitive, and the wiring is really dynamic
Stenodyon#8192: Yup, you need to multi wire pegs 1 to n-1 to pegs 2 to n <[newline]> video: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901199821212352573/905095379484282911
Arc#5873: like that but so they actually connect
Arc#5873: 
Arc#5873: Hi, is there a way to cross connect straight rows of pegs without clicking each one individually?
HuntaBadday#3556: This mod: https://github.com/cheese3660/CheeseUtilMod <[newline]> If there has to be a separate version for the server then it won't work?
circuitgamer77#0377: I accidently hit enter mid-message :)
Erikbot#6368: excellent word wrapping
circuitgamer77#0377: 'm working on  at the same time as this conversation.
circuitgamer77#0377: Give me a few minutes - I have to finish something I
Erikbot#6368: Im in vc if you want to talk instead of type
circuitgamer77#0377: In-world speed, not IRL speed.  This will not be the kindest to the sim.
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know specifically yet, but I know of a few different use cases and I'm really designing this processor for speed over nearly every other factor
circuitgamer77#0377: But I don't want to have to store every possible mask
Erikbot#6368: what exactly do you need a dynamic bitmask for?
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm much less worried about memory accesses as I am about the constructing masks from scratch
Erikbot#6368: then they don't have to be static
circuitgamer77#0377: They can
Erikbot#6368: the bitwise operations should be able to operate on registers too
circuitgamer77#0377: But then you still only get one static pattern, and constructing a mask from scratch would be much slower.
Erikbot#6368: the standard way to handle full sized immediates is to have a small value, bit shift it and or it with another immediate to get the full bit width.
circuitgamer77#0377: And memory accesses are slow, and aren't as flexible.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm hoping to avoid immediates that have to fill the whole width - my instruction layout can't have large immidiates, unless you store the value somewhere in RAM ahead of time and use a memory access.
circuitgamer77#0377: With the spare bits for controls like inverting either the top or bottom.
Erikbot#6368: bitwise or with the immediate 1111**1111?
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm hoping to make it one instruction with two operands - number of bits on the top, and number on the bottom.
circuitgamer77#0377: so maybe something like 11110011 - filling the top four bits and the bottom two.
Erikbot#6368: you can do that in a few instructions with bitwise or and bitshift.
circuitgamer77#0377: Creating a byte/word with a pattern of bits on the ends that fill to a point.
Erikbot#6368: with filling, do you mean setting parts of a value to 1?
circuitgamer77#0377: I know there's a lot of things that can be done with that kind of filler to speed up systems.
circuitgamer77#0377: I am planning to make a bit filler (don't know what the proper name is) - something that fills the top bits to a point, or the bottom bits, or fill all but one bit, or just one bit in the middle, or filling a range in the middle with either ones or zeros.
Erikbot#6368: including bitwise operations should barely add any hardware to your adder.
Erikbot#6368: it can be used for modulo with powers of 2
circuitgamer77#0377: Checking for overlap is and gates, but I can't immediately think of a use for that besides something with bitmaps or flags.
circuitgamer77#0377: one with xors, and one with buffers.  I realized that can be 0 ticks as you said that :)
Erikbot#6368: well checking if not zero can be done in 0 ticks
circuitgamer77#0377: I think both can be one tick though.
circuitgamer77#0377: Correction - checking if zero, not !=.
Erikbot#6368: if you add a xnor next to your xor, you can invert the MSB in one less tick
circuitgamer77#0377: Checking for != can be done in one tick, which is nice.  Or I can just use the subtractor for comparison, which is two ticks slower but doesn't require more hardware.
Erikbot#6368: I am integrating every single comparasion operation, max, min, add, sub in my 3 tick ALU
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm debating having a separate circuit for adding vs subtracting (so even more busses) that's 2 tick, so adding would end up faster than subtracting.  I might make a separate comparator as well, so I can optimize for speed.  I already have a ton of busses though - it's getting ridiculous.
Erikbot#6368: I am using it to make a 3 tick ALU, the extra delay is enough to do  any sign operation to the inputs, which makes it quite flexible.
Erikbot#6368: probably not within a reasonable number of components.
circuitgamer77#0377: Do you know if there's a way to do a subtractor (besides just making a lookup table for every possible input) within 2 ticks?  Inverting B always adds a tick for my designs.
Erikbot#6368: look in thread for an exploded view of the circuit.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes, thanks!
Erikbot#6368: here is my 2 tick adder https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/942342740665061396
circuitgamer77#0377: Might have been a 2 tick adder, not ALU, but I'm not sure.
circuitgamer77#0377: Does anyone have a link to the message that someone sent previously for a 2 tick ALU?  I'm trying to find that message, but I'm struggling.
Ecconia#4929: That is the downside of voice chat distributed information...
GHXX#9078: oh i wasnt aware
Ecconia#4929: But then he decided against it again which I think he only announced in voice chat, so I cannot quote it. Nor is it for sure. <[newline]> So there is also a chance it won't come. But not sure what the current decision is.
Infini#5724: Sweet! Now I dont have to create a memory stick to load a 16 byte program
GHXX#9078: iirc jimmy said in <#401255675264761868> that it will be added in a future version with the justification that there are many different designs to build a ram, but a rom is very boring - thus it will be added. <[newline]> You should be able to find it fairly quickly using a simple search in <#401255675264761868>
Ecconia#4929: (reply/ping me or I won't see it, but I might be asleep)
Ecconia#4929: In that case set the log level to trace <[newline]> (Put `loglevel "trace"` into the file in the `licc-server` folder) and check what the mod loader prints. <[newline]> Which mod if I may ask, yours? <[newline]> Does contain an `ignore` file? Does it have a server mod class?
HuntaBadday#3556: The client works but the server doesn't detect it in it's folder
HuntaBadday#3556: It's not working for me
Ecconia#4929: GameData folder ofc, just like client
HuntaBadday#3556: Where did you put the mod files
Ecconia#4929: adds a display
Ecconia#4929: yes, one
cheese3660#8641: <@!151293812675706880> I know you have mods on your server?
HuntaBadday#3556: I know it's possible if others have mods on their servers
cheese3660#8641: Hmm ... idrk
cheese3660#8641: okii
HuntaBadday#3556: just the cheeseutil
cheese3660#8641: because you should do the latter
cheese3660#8641: Wait, did you put the entire github repository folder in there, or just the cheeseutil subfolder?
HuntaBadday#3556: Yeah, but it doesn't work
cheese3660#8641: Is there a gamedata folder?
cheese3660#8641: I don't exactly know
HuntaBadday#3556: How do I add mods to a server again?
cheese3660#8641: The bits on the ram are with the lsb being the smallest peg btw ... and its the same order on the output
HuntaBadday#3556: Ok
cheese3660#8641: Also, instructions on how to load the values are in there
HuntaBadday#3556: thanks
HuntaBadday#3556: ight
cheese3660#8641: <#910673109164638239> in this thread
HuntaBadday#3556: Send link please
HuntaBadday#3556: OOH
cheese3660#8641: 1,4,8,16 bit data, 4,8,16 bit address lines
HuntaBadday#3556: How many bits?
cheese3660#8641: its ram, but it can be loaded from a file
BitorBit#6268: ok
cheese3660#8641: I mean, I already have a mod that can be used somewhat like rom
HuntaBadday#3556: I heard somewhere that there was going to be ROM
BitorBit#6268: because needs to be "physticly" changed to change value
BitorBit#6268: probably never
HuntaBadday#3556: I mean a ROM component
BitorBit#6268: it is in game
HuntaBadday#3556: So when will ROM be added to the game?
Erikbot#6368: I would say that jump on zero and jump on most significant bit are the most important
JC Denton#9567: I have still one instruction left to use, should I use jump on significant for that and have both JZ and JC too?
JC Denton#9567: However I don't remember how to do conditional jumps based on JZ or JC?
JC Denton#9567: Of course I use it
Erikbot#6368: it represents negative numbers in a way where, for example (-4) + 4 = 0 using a standard adder
Erikbot#6368: you should use 2s complement btw
Erikbot#6368: if you subtract a number so that it becomes negative, the highest bit will be set in 2s complement.
JC Denton#9567: Maybe I don't need the highest bit jump? Never heard of that
Erikbot#6368: jump on zero is enough to make it turing complete, but would require absurd program sizes. with jump on carry you can do comparisons, so I would say that it is enough. if you add a jump on the state of the highest (most significant) bit, you can make comparisons significantly easier.
Flampt#3906: Actually not sure about branching, nvm
Flampt#3906: Yes
JC Denton#9567: Is jump on zero and jump on carry enough for conditional branching?
circuitgamer77#0377: I might have to look into modding myself at some point - I can't use the existing storage mods because I've been designing different memory structures from scratch for every new processor architecture, and they don't match the modded structures.
NGeorge#5042: ... what does it do because i im new lmao.
cheese3660#8641: I mean ... I have a storage mod
NGeorge#5042: modded storage?? what
Erikbot#6368: *1 MB of ram covering the entire world*
Erikbot#6368: yeah, that seems necessary if you want to have more than a kilobyte of ram.
Ecconia#4929: Replace huge chunks of it with modded storage 🤪 <[newline]> ||That's what I will probably do, while the components will have the same size, they gonna have much less component counts||
Erikbot#6368: put files in the gamedata folder.
BitorBit#6268: how do you even add mods?
Erikbot#6368: to some small extent, try the loadaccelerator mod, which reduces collider lag.
CodeMaker_4#5396: Ok. I was hoping that I was doing something wrong, but I guess this is just how LW is now. I have heard that some lag will be fixed by disabling the colliders for objects, do you thing that could also fix these lagspikes?
BitorBit#6268: try removeing these smaller sircuts and place them on one big one
BitorBit#6268: that might be a kinda problem
CodeMaker_4#5396: I have two versions of this, one with each layer having it's own big curcuit board that has smaller curcuit baords for the bytes, and another where the individual bytes are placed directly on top of and next to each other
Erikbot#6368: your ram seems about as optimized as would be reasonable.
Erikbot#6368: in general, large things causes a bit of a lag spike when you pick them up, but this will eventually be optimized.
BitorBit#6268: how are sircuts boards placed?
CodeMaker_4#5396: 
BitorBit#6268: how it looks
BitorBit#6268: can you show us ram?
Erikbot#6368: remove as many parts as possible. yes, even pegs.
CodeMaker_4#5396: how to make large ram that doesn't cause lag spikes when you pick it up? <[newline]> Like I am trying to make 256 byte ram, but if I try to pick it up there is a 3 sec lagspike <[newline]> intel i7 3.9Ghz <[newline]> 16Gb memory <[newline]> GTX 1650 <[newline]> SSD <[newline]> During the lagspike there isn't a noticeable spike in CPU usage, but GPU usage does dip as nothing is being rendered during the lagspike.
Erikbot#6368: there would have to be changes to the logic world code to multi-thread things.
BitorBit#6268: ?
Erikbot#6368: that is not how programs work
BitorBit#6268: can i add more threads?
Erikbot#6368: it is mostly single threaded, but the server runs on a separate thread.
BitorBit#6268: (cores)
BitorBit#6268: how much CPU does LW uses?
circuitgamer77#0377: And that
ierdna100#9840: putting them on a bigger board seems to work
circuitgamer77#0377: No, but board saving is coming soon
Justin#2534: Is there a way to associate boards together so that when pasting a board tens of times, you don't have to multi select over and over?
ierdna100#9840: if their blue ends are adjacent
ierdna100#9840: so sockets allow you to make boards that are compatible with another, and transfer data between them
ierdna100#9840: Wires cannot be copied when they go across 2 circuit boards
NGeorge#5042: Does it just illuminate when powered up? or?
NGeorge#5042: but what does it do?
circuitgamer77#0377: They do the same thing, just with different sizes.  Fine place the smaller socket with ctrl to fit 3 per tile.
NGeorge#5042: Also what does the  <[newline]> Socket and Chubby Socket its both does the same thing?
Arc#5873: Thankyou!
Ecconia#4929: Yes: `Control + MiddleMouseButton`, given you did not change your controls. <[newline]> (To pick up a component with properties)
Arc#5873: is there a way to put colored circuit board in to the hot bar
DanielGJ44#4557: I think "struggle" will depend on your hardware though
DanielGJ44#4557: I've heard of long load times from 1MB files
LOOPS#1372: lol ouch
RyanT#1426: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: 0b
LOOPS#1372: At what file size does LW start to struggle?
Dragon Lord#6944: with a mod or multiselecting and copy pasting. there isn't really a way to drag/place multiple components at the moment :T
Justin#2534: How do you drag and place multiple displays quickly?
GHXX#9078: oracle: 1bit rng essentially <[newline]> buffer: 1 tick delay <[newline]> fast buffer: 0 tick delay, but signal can only go into one direction <[newline]> dlatch: output get set to the side pin whenever the top pin is enabled, otherwise it remembers the state <[newline]> <@!219587908850417674>

NGeorge#5042: What does the D Latch ?
PseudoGoose#2841: also there will be a nicer UI for changing tick rate coming in the next version - https://logicworld.net/view/pst-01942e7d/logic-world-wednesdays-season-premier
PseudoGoose#2841: but don't take my word for it, I haven't tested it that much
PseudoGoose#2841: for most practical things, somewhere below that but often above 1000
PseudoGoose#2841: depends on the circuit, but I think it can spin as fast as a million TPS for simple things
circuitgamer77#0377: (Does anyone know if the tickrate is stored as a float or as a double?  I know it isn't an int because you can do fractional tickrates.).
sorgan71#6324: holy cow, any ballpark estimate of how fast a typical computer can run this, I'd love to make a high power thing
circuitgamer77#0377: There is none, theoretically :)
PseudoGoose#2841: as fast as your computer can run it
sorgan71#6324: whats the max tick rate?
sorgan71#6324: cool
sorgan71#6324: NO WAY
sorgan71#6324: NO
sorgan71#6324: BRO
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah, you can :)
sorgan71#6324: wait can I acutally just run at 1000 ticks/s
PseudoGoose#2841: make sure to type it exactly (including `server` and the quotes)
sorgan71#6324: it says command not found
PseudoGoose#2841: the default is 30
PseudoGoose#2841: that would change it to 10 ticks per second
PseudoGoose#2841: if you open the console (I think it is backtick? \`)  and type `server "simulation.rate 10"`
sorgan71#6324: how do I do that?
PseudoGoose#2841: It could still be there, but you don't see it because of framerate lag? You can try lowering the simulation speed
sorgan71#6324: any reason why it would skip a pulse?
PseudoGoose#2841: Oh, yes, I see that now
sorgan71#6324: and high to low right?
PseudoGoose#2841: Right, that should make a 1 tick pulse every time the clock goes low->high
sorgan71#6324: this is a binary to BCD converter FYI
sorgan71#6324: the bottom part of the circiut i'm looking at contains the pulser. The clock is the bottom series of sockets
PseudoGoose#2841: Can you share a screenshot of the circuit?
sorgan71#6324: I am trying to make a circuit that outputs 1 for 1 tick after a change in the clock value, I.E. flipping a switch on and then off would output two pulses, i made a circiut that does this but sometimes it just dosent output a value, why is this?
JC Denton#9567: you need to start from the left peg I see
JC Denton#9567: I used multiwire to connect 16 pegs to every right input of AND gates, how do I connect to the left ones?
sorgan71#6324: ok, so I got it working, took a while but your method worked, thank you
Erikbot#6368: I am not sure what you are asking. It is possible to use delays to make a circuit synced with other parts of the circuit.
Erikbot#6368: Clock goes on the write part
sorgan71#6324: why not use delays in that case?
sorgan71#6324: wait so how though, is the clock put on the set part of the latch?
Saltypretzel#0321: yes it usually has an oscillator, but oscillators can be anything that repeats basically
Erikbot#6368: that is used to coordinate actions of digital circuits.
sorgan71#6324: so it is an oscilator?
Erikbot#6368: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal
Erikbot#6368: In electronics and especially synchronous digital circuits, a clock signal (historically also known as logic beat[1]) oscillates between a high and a low state and is used like a metronome to coordinate actions of digital circuits.
Verlio_H#0201: basically just a signal that gets repeated at certain intervals
sorgan71#6324: what is a clock signal, cause all I know is an inverter connected to itself
Erikbot#6368: in logic world, every circuit is perfectly synced to a clock, namely the game tick. this is used to create synchronous circuits without an explicit clock signal, however this requires perfect timing, it is therefore often simpler to use a clock signal that writes to registers so that signals have time to propagate in a circuit.
Verlio_H#0201: "Synchronization is the coordination of events to operate a system in unison. "
Erikbot#6368: no
sorgan71#6324: so just an oscillator?
Erikbot#6368: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization  <[newline]> > In electrical engineering terms, for digital logic and data transfer, a synchronous circuit requires a clock signal. A clock signal simply signals the start or end of some time period, often measured in microseconds or nanoseconds, that has an arbitrary relationship to any other system of measurement of the passage of minutes, hours, and days.
sorgan71#6324: one that is timed well
Erikbot#6368: what do you think a syncronus circuit is?
sorgan71#6324: I would get using relays but not latches
sorgan71#6324: How do you use it to make a synconous circiut? I dont get that part
Erikbot#6368: small correction, the circuit I made is not inherently iterative or non-iterative it is simply the add-3 module part. I have made both iterative and non iterative BCD converters with it.
Erikbot#6368: but in logic world, the logic is perfect, so sometimes the registers can be replaced with perfect timing
Erikbot#6368: registers are what is used to make a circut syncronus
sorgan71#6324: I might just syncronise the circiut
sorgan71#6324: like I know how they work but how would they be applied here?
sorgan71#6324: how would I use one of those? I dont have experience with d latches
Erikbot#6368: d-latches
Erikbot#6368: the module takes 2 ticks
sorgan71#6324: Wdym registers?
sorgan71#6324: 1 tick per bit
Erikbot#6368: also what rate are the input bits sent in?
Erikbot#6368: cause otherwise you would need to make a perfectly syncronus circuit.
Erikbot#6368: are you using registers to store the temporary values that are iterated upon?
sorgan71#6324: I then made that module iterative
sorgan71#6324: with your module
sorgan71#6324: I did that
Erikbot#6368: here is one way to set it up non-iterativley, you should try building that and then making it iterative.
sorgan71#6324: I.E I had the data loop back inside of one module 3 times so that it could apply the logic to each iteration
sorgan71#6324: Yes, the one you made is not iterative, the looping it back on itself made it so.
Erikbot#6368: you are definitely using the one I made
sorgan71#6324: It worked how the table predicted
sorgan71#6324: Wdym? it added 3 when I tested it
Erikbot#6368: it still needed several layers of add-3 modules
sorgan71#6324: Well, I am using I think the one you made
Erikbot#6368: I am using iterative to mean "feed back into itself"
Erikbot#6368: I have built a non iterative variant
Erikbot#6368: any standard iterative circuit can be made non iterative.
sorgan71#6324: Well its supposed to be iterative, so I dont have a choice really
Erikbot#6368: well, you can, but iterative circuits are generally harder
sorgan71#6324: Its something that I thought I could make iterative
Erikbot#6368: have you built a non iterative variant? that might be good practice to see how the algorithm works.
sorgan71#6324: yes
sorgan71#6324: so for evey 4 bits I add a board
Erikbot#6368: so the number of iterations and number of boards grow linearly with number of bits?
sorgan71#6324: but it is designed to iterate over its boards so that with more boards, you have more iterations and you only need to linearly increase the ammount of chips with bits
sorgan71#6324: its based of of the 128 bit converter done by ecconia but with signifigant differences, the vertical panel is, on one side, the logic for the truth table of 5>=add3. The other side routes the output of the truth table into itself but one bit over.
sorgan71#6324: 
sorgan71#6324: Can anybody tell me what im doing wrong? im making a double dabble bin to bcd converter and the actual ansewers are coming out gibberish
Limón#7879: #cyberpunk
CrispyPin#1149: nobody can blame you after the heat death of the universe
CrispyPin#1149: just say that it will happen, but not when
Jimmy#8080: And also maybe never. Mechanical gameplay is not a promise, though I really do want to do it eventually.
Erikbot#6368: maybe in a few years
BitorBit#6268: i need to know to be ready to make mehanical computer
BitorBit#6268: what all "meanical" would be in update
Erikbot#6368: official website or https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/905378240338726942
slendi#2681: Where can I find public servers?
Flampt#3906: Ok thanks
Flampt#3906: <:pepoS:596577130893279272>
Erikbot#6368: in real CPU:s, there are pipeline registers to store the values between stages, but in logic world we can do a bit of a hack, we make each step take exactly the same amount of time. but the hack makes branching/jumping even harder.
Erikbot#6368: modern CPU:s can have as many as 20 stages
Erikbot#6368: hazards can be solved by clever programming or changing hardware.
Erikbot#6368: pipelined CPU:s are more complicated because what if a jump is performed or an instruction needs a register before it is written to? these pipelining problems are called hazards.
Erikbot#6368: a CPU typically executes several steps when running an instruction, lets use `fetch F`, `decode D` and `execute E` as an example. an unpipelined CPU would have to wait until all of these steps are done until running the next instruction, but a pipelined processor has different instruction in each of its parts. this means that this example processor would become 3 times faster if it was pipelined. lets say a program consists of add, sub and then an xor, then the timings would look like this: ``` <[newline]> add:  F   D   E <[newline]> sub:      F   D   E <[newline]> xor:          F   D   E```
Flampt#3906: What does it mean when something a cpu is pipelined?
Ecconia#4929: Can you record this issue or provide reconstruction steps?
sorgan71#6324: so for some reason when I do multi wire connections, it only connects two pegs, not all of them, does anybody know why?
Erikbot#6368: kB is fine in vanilla if your ram is optimized, minimize number of parts and reduce number of average active components.
DoctorFoxy#5440: I see, thanks
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: D flip flops with relays for ram. If you want kilobytes you'd probably want a mod. Megabytes even more so. HMM has some memory modules. And even single word d latches and relays so you can make them like with the same footprint and stuff with up to 64 times less component count.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: For adders and multipliers, I use diagrams, never needed a k map for an alu.
DoctorFoxy#5440: Well, there arent transistors yet anyways
DoctorFoxy#5440: And for memory, do you guys use flip flops? Because I dont think capacitors would work too well in this game to make like 6T or 8T SRAM cells
DoctorFoxy#5440: Also, do you guys use diagrams that already exist and just build from that or figure everything out yourself? Like doing the K maps yourself when building an ALU and thelike?
DoctorFoxy#5440: Is there a list of ideas for small to large projects you can try to build? I have no idea what to make :p
Reese4221#8317: tragic
GHXX#9078: would also be good if the errors regarding mod-loading were visible in the normal loglevel, not just when setting it to "trace"
Jimmy#8080: and PG-13 😛
Jimmy#8080: they're all much more helpful now
Jimmy#8080: yeah one of the first things I did for 0.91 is a pass on all the error messages
CrispyPin#1149: jimmy i hope you are making better error messages; just because it cant happen doesnt mean it wont
CrispyPin#1149: ~~yet it is quite common~~
Jimmy#8080: 🙏
ierdna100#9840: I did, it worked
Jimmy#8080: Check your `backups` folder, you should be able to find a version of your save from just before the corruption.
ierdna100#9840: impressive
Jimmy#8080: That error message indicates an impossible state, you should never see it 😐
ierdna100#9840: I tried copying an 8 bit decoder and it crashed, now I cannot load into the server anymore
ierdna100#9840: Whenever I connect to my server it simply crashes
ierdna100#9840: what on earth does this mean
LOOPS#1372: I found myself Unable to place gates except for every other square for some reason, I'll try again though
Erikbot#6368: there is nothing directly stopping you from building vertically, as long as the chain of components isn't too long.
LOOPS#1372: Is making a computer vertically feasible rn? I tried on the grassland map and it led to many many bugs
sorgan71#6324: kk
Ecconia#4929: I am in LWWVC, can type later
sorgan71#6324: wdym?
Ecconia#4929: Implementation wise it is the same. I just explain it differently.
sorgan71#6324: Ok, I'm familiar with that, but double dabblle typically looks like pyramid shape, whats different about yours?
Ecconia#4929: Pretty much an algorithm called Double Dabble.
sorgan71#6324: So what method did you use to decode your binary into BCD?
Ecconia#4929: Most of the time yes
sorgan71#6324: <@!151293812675706880> Did you use BCD in your 7 segment display?
Hugin#2596: thank you <[newline]> I added the option to write a 0 which is insanely straight forward <[newline]> still didn't add subtracting but will work on that some time  <[newline]> when I finish it I will send it and maybe someone will improve on my mess
CrispyBacon7#9048: ty
Erikbot#6368: here I what I used for ROM, the levers are labeled and colored to make it easier to program. Another alternative is to use ram as program memory, but that might make things slightly more complicated.
BitorBit#6268: i do
CrispyBacon7#9048: does anyone have a good program memory design?
Jimmy#8080: ah yes, my bad
sorgan71#6324: no, he was responding to my question
Jimmy#8080: Wrong channel? I think you meant <#901195561980543007> :)
sorgan71#6324: thank you so much!
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: The dots are connected straight. Oh, and the top right register isn't really a shift register.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Mine's like this, but with just the encoder. Or rather an encoded conditional adder.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: The black board is reverse double dabble, but it converts binary to BCD for the fractional part.
Limón#7879: Something I was doing a while ago was this
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: It's double dabble. But I have a register in front of a single row of double dabble modules, route the output into the input of the registers with a shift, and have a second register that's shifted into that.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's my floating point to BCD converter.
sorgan71#6324: yes
sorgan71#6324: One that does not require exponentially more modules like the double dabble method shown here
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: What do you mean by modularly?
Limón#7879: do you mean BCD?
sorgan71#6324: does anybody know a way to modularly convert binary to BCE
Limón#7879: is it a counter
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's a modular flat version.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's one, though it might be a bit of a mess to reverse-engineer.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I can make one real quick.
Hugin#2596: show some gates diagram or screenshot or whatever that could help me <[newline]> even info on how fast it can possibly be would help
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: What do you mean by share?
Hugin#2596: does anyone want to share a counter with set function and (and maybe subtracting) <[newline]> my abomination just is plain awful and I'm considering just making a clock to add until it matches the input
sorgan71#6324: one last thing, thats for 8 bit right? does it work for more than 8 bit?
sorgan71#6324: ok, thank you
Erikbot#6368: ~ is not
Erikbot#6368: & is and
Erikbot#6368: yes
sorgan71#6324: does the | mean or?
Erikbot#6368: 
Erikbot#6368: I simplified it to: ```variable: a <[newline]> (a | b) & (a | c | d) <[newline]>  <[newline]> variable: b <[newline]> ~c & (b | d) & (a | ~d) <[newline]>  <[newline]> variable: c <[newline]> (a | c) & (c | ~d) & (d | ~b) <[newline]>  <[newline]> variable: d <[newline]> (a | b | d) & (a | c | d) & (~a | ~d) & (~b | ~d)```
Erikbot#6368: you don't need to understand the algorithm to produce the circuit, as long as it has the correct output. (I didn't understand it when I built the original circuit)
sorgan71#6324: im sorry I am a little slow at things like this lol
sorgan71#6324: so what is the shift and add 3 algorithm?
Erikbot#6368: the "shift and add-3" algorithm is also called double-dabble
Erikbot#6368: the bit shift refers to the way the circuit outputs of one layer connect to the next
Erikbot#6368: you need multiple copies of it to convert a number
Erikbot#6368: so the circuit that I made is the "C" circuit
sorgan71#6324: thats the article im talking about
Erikbot#6368: did you take a look at this: https://www.johnloomis.org/ece314/notes/devices/binary_to_BCD/bin_to_bcd.html
sorgan71#6324: I'm kind of confused, the article you posted says shift to the left one bit, but in all the examples it shifts it more than one bit, am I misunderstanding it?
Erikbot#6368: the module that I built needs to be placed multiple times in series to convert larger numbers.
Erikbot#6368: nevermind, yes it is for bcd
sorgan71#6324: so, what is it supposed to do? is it something for bcd?
Flampt#3906: It's pretty big and kinda slow it you dont turn up the simulation rate by a lot
Flampt#3906: I made his breadboard computer in logic world
Erikbot#6368: also, pipelining becomes basically impossible without separate buses for everything.
cheese3660#8641: I at least need a seperate address bus to keep things efficient
Erikbot#6368: a single bus is easier to wire, but the logic to handle 2 separate things on a single bus will probably make things way more complicated. I think 2 separate buses is going to be easier and simpler to handle, at least that was the case for the cpu:s I have built so far.
nemerod#0256: the keyboard generate the packet, why not touching the clock ? 🙂
Prime#8883: Anyway, I know how to do it, I just don't know if it is *worth doing*
nemerod#0256: i prefer the PS/2 with clock speed turned to big 🙂
Prime#8883: Yeah, Ben Eater, I've seen him. Still haven't watched his whole 8-bit breadboard computer series, but I found his explanation of the USB protocol very interesting.
nemerod#0256: you need with 1 main bus, several tick for talk with the alu for exemple if you get the opcode with the main bus, you need sync all value <[newline]>  <[newline]> you can watching the guy  <[newline]> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU <[newline]>  <[newline]> he build the cpu with main bus
Prime#8883: A single bi-directional bus means twice as many clock cycles for most operations, which is a major hit to performance.
Prime#8883: Just not sure what the best move is here
Prime#8883: Is generally a good idea to have a single bi-directional main bus for the CPU? Originally, I was going to have a two bus system, one going from registers and memory and one leading back into them. However, I found a single bus to be simpler and that other people have adopted that architecture as well.
CrispyBacon7#9048: k ty
ierdna100#9840: higher to lower
CrispyBacon7#9048: is bit shift right the one that shifts to higher bits?
Dragon Lord#6944: one tick
CrispyBacon7#9048: how much?
Dragon Lord#6944: except for the fast buffer and the relay (if it's already on)
CrispyBacon7#9048: do all logic gates have delay?
cheese3660#8641: But no, I find an integer divider to be way too complex of a block to put into a modded block
cheese3660#8641: ~~well i do have a binary to bcd block, but thats because making displays and such is not fun, so i made it to quickly drive a seven segment, but I've made the circuits before~~
sorgan71#6324: I thought you meant like add it as a logic block, like xor or something
Erikbot#6368: here is an optimized circuit module that I made: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/938075954629185597
cheese3660#8641: making an integer divider is not being lazy
sorgan71#6324: if you wanna be lazy this is not the game for you lol
cheese3660#8641: ~~the main reason I want an integer divider is because it makes it possible to be lazy in doing bin2bcd~~
sorgan71#6324: ok thank you
Erikbot#6368: here is the article I used: https://www.johnloomis.org/ece314/notes/devices/binary_to_BCD/bin_to_bcd.html
sorgan71#6324: ok so how do you convert from BCD to Binery?
sorgan71#6324: ok thank you
Erikbot#6368: what you are describing is "binary coded decimal" or BCD.
sorgan71#6324: is there any way to seperate parts of a bianary number into digets for a decimal number? I.E. Taking 10100(bianary for 36) and turning it into 0011(bianary for 3) and 0110(bianary for 6)?
nemerod#0256: you can 🙂
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm loading the game to show my design as well
nemerod#0256: 2 sec, i launche the game and take a screenshot for exemple
nemerod#0256: oh, sorry, i already build big modular memory with several cell block with the function i want and page address for setting 🙂
circuitgamer77#0377: accidently keep hitting enter...
circuitgamer77#0377: e
circuitgamer77#0377: 'm pretty sure that's not possibl
circuitgamer77#0377: If it's just the NOT it would be 1 tick, but I
nemerod#0256: <:inverter:568324872984330240>
circuitgamer77#0377: The wording is confusing me
circuitgamer77#0377: What do you mean by "just the NOT"?
nemerod#0256: you can made the decoder with just the NOT <[newline]> 2 tick with any size
circuitgamer77#0377: which is programmable
circuitgamer77#0377: I use xors outputting to an inverter
Pedro Martineli#5700: or just another way to build an decoder
Pedro Martineli#5700: Is there a way to make decoders without and gates?
sorgan71#6324: Ok I figured it out, in the main xor loop, you just add a relay and that controls the presence of data.
sorgan71#6324: wdym?
IDoget#3748: the one i posted recently are not what you need
sorgan71#6324: it seems like the boards are obsucring it, could i have another angle?
sorgan71#6324: I tried to copy your but I get the same problem
IDoget#3748: 4 bits of flip flops. all reset with 1 button press
IDoget#3748: tiny recreation of this
SnaveSutit#0042: Yeah, just wanted to cover all my bases incase something funky was goin' on
Ecconia#4929: The server only uses UDP btw, but looks good. UFF.
SnaveSutit#0042: 
SnaveSutit#0042: Debian 10 with ufw configured properly to my knowledge
SnaveSutit#0042: 
Ecconia#4929: Ahh then no firewall at least. Which OS?
SnaveSutit#0042: Other game servers hosted on the machine have worked perfectly fine in the past. Never had any issues with Minecraft, Space engineers, or Terraria
Ecconia#4929: I am out of ideas at this point. I would keep an eye on the servers console. Check/Confirm that the server has no firewall setting which blocks/whitelists some IPs
Ecconia#4929: Super weird....
SnaveSutit#0042: The server is in canada, just above Michigan. We are in the USA
SnaveSutit#0042: yes
Ecconia#4929: Ahh okay, good to know. Are you in the same country?
FetchBot#1225: sorry i won't be able to answer questions about the server, this is SnaveSutit's server btw ^^^
SnaveSutit#0042: It's quite odd, because it's not hosted localy, and I'm connecting in the same way he is and it works fine
Ecconia#4929: So no, the issue is not on your side. <[newline]> I cannot connect to it at all. It does not even respond. <[newline]> Not sure how your friend joins. But the server at that port is not answering at all.
Ecconia#4929: So my client also has a connection timed out. I will try my custom (self-written) client.
FetchBot#1225: 
Ecconia#4929: Ahh that is good
FetchBot#1225: i don't think there is a major issue, its a publicly known domain and the server has a password
Ecconia#4929: Since you already shared the domain to the server (Only do that, when its okay to do that). I could see what my multiplayer screen says.
FetchBot#1225: 1 sec
Ecconia#4929: So that is already a problem. And it also says time out when you try to join it?
FetchBot#1225: 
Ecconia#4929: The game itself has a ping value in the multiplayer menu.
FetchBot#1225: and the port the server on does respond differently when i try and ping that.
FetchBot#1225: its def not using hamachi and im sure im not using hamachi, I am able to ping the server.
IDoget#3748: i have no clue. I cant port forward because i dont own my router (dont ask its a long story) so i have to use hamachi to have my friends connect to my server
Ecconia#4929: But you are right, it might be stuff like Hamachi for one side.
IDoget#3748: ok just making sure 🙂
Ecconia#4929: He already said, both are remote and it works for the friend 🙂
Ecconia#4929: The client setting is in `settings_master.succ` : `MHG.Networking.Secret.InGameTimeOutMilliseconds: 25000` (25 seconds)
FetchBot#1225: yes
IDoget#3748: did your friend port forward?
FetchBot#1225: according to him the server console is not sending anything when we try to connect outside of himself(but he is able to connect normally)
Ecconia#4929: What is the server console printing, when you are loosing connection. <[newline]> -> Else try the `PlayerTimeOutSeconds` setting. <[newline]> Also, what does LW say is your ping to the server?
FetchBot#1225: he is able to connect, i am unable, we are both on remote machines from the actual server.
Ecconia#4929: Can your friend connect? <[newline]> Is he inside or outside of the servers machine / network? <[newline]> Time out "should" mean, that one of the parties server or client did not receive a packet from the other side for (I believe 60 seconds). You can change the server sided setting in the `config.succ` file. <[newline]> The setting `PlayerTimeOutSeconds : 60` says how long the server waits for an answer, as test you could improve that. The client should have this setting too somewhere - I guess. <[newline]> But if even waiting for 5 minutes does not work, then something is quite wrong with your network connection. <[newline]> How big is the world? <[newline]> Always check console, it should print a message once the client is no longer connected.
FetchBot#1225: hey, a friend of mine set up a server but i keep getting timed out when connecting, what steps can we take to debug this?
sorgan71#6324: I see, thank you
IDoget#3748: boom
sorgan71#6324: yeah, basically
IDoget#3748: with button input
IDoget#3748: you want a binary counter
sorgan71#6324: yeah, so when you push the input button it sequences it, I just found a version that does work which is basically what I did without the iverter at the top right
IDoget#3748: wait so you want the output of the first one to be the input of the second?
IDoget#3748: example in 4 bits. ignore background
sorgan71#6324: I might be wrong but it looks like the bits are not connected
IDoget#3748: just carry the reset input across all the bits
IDoget#3748: this works in testing
IDoget#3748: 
sorgan71#6324: like this
sorgan71#6324: 
sorgan71#6324: to put them in sequence i had to invert the output
IDoget#3748: but idk yet
IDoget#3748: you prob just need fast buffers
IDoget#3748: ok lemme make that rn
IDoget#3748: oh
sorgan71#6324: its doing that but I want it to go to 0000000
sorgan71#6324: if you put them in series and have them clear all at once it will not set them all to zero but only set the first one to zero and have the sequence transfer one forward, I.E if you press the reset button on a sequence with 0110100 it will go to 0011010
IDoget#3748: like 011001 but and when you reset it goes to 000000
IDoget#3748: are you trying to make binary words with a larger width that resets on 1 button press?
IDoget#3748: not sure what you mean...
sorgan71#6324: is there any way to clear without transfering the bit through the other bits?
sorgan71#6324: I see
ierdna100#9840: when the counter is at that position
ierdna100#9840: binary 1011
sorgan71#6324: what is 0b1011?
ierdna100#9840: I believe you could AND 0b1011 (0d11) and if it is true, then it resets to 0 the same clock cycle
sorgan71#6324: does anybody know how to make a 4 bit counter roll over at 10 instead of 16?
Pedro Martineli#5700: ah ok, thanks!
Ecconia#4929: So most of the time, you have a board with a display and a D-Latch behind it. The D-Latch stores the pixel-data. (this gets stacked to have more than just one pixel) <[newline]> You might want to add more D-Latches, if you want to have more colors (more than just ON or OFF). <[newline]> To change the pixels for a CPU control, you would want to send a pair of X and Y coordinate to the display, and it will turn the pixel at that position ON or OFF. <[newline]> For images, you might want to control it a little bit differently. I have seen displays, where all the pixels had many many many wires going to some memory.
Pedro Martineli#5700: I want to display simple images, shapes, something simple... <[newline]> hmmm, I don't know. Maybe some simple CPU?
Ecconia#4929: What should the screen be able to display/show? <[newline]> How do you want to edit what it shows?
Pedro Martineli#5700: how can i make a screen?
Ecconia#4929: <@!121786044197765131> Let me jump on that train too. <[newline]> Players have the freedom to build things in Logic World how they want. <[newline]> Just because it does not work in real life or is inefficient, that does not make it bad. <[newline]> The LogicWorld universe has its own physics and hence own rules and solutions. <[newline]> And yes we cannot highlight it enough **Logic World is not real physics** (intentionally, according to Jimmy). <[newline]>  <[newline]> To get back to your bad practices argument. <[newline]> A person that has literally no intention about building circuits in real life and just builds them for fun in LW does not need to follow  any IRL practice. <[newline]> And even if one works in such fields, it is important to **know** that it will not work, but it is not important to follow it, as long as you know the consequences with real digital hardware! <[newline]> So feel free to teach us about things that will not work in real life, but do not name them wrong in the LW universe, they are perfectly valid there. <[newline]> And it is not ignorant to follow the LW rules, that is just art and freedom of doing whatever one likes the way it can be enjoyed most. <[newline]>  <[newline]> (Rethoric part, no need to answer to questions and statements).  <[newline]> Also I am not sure how you allow yourself to build ICA. Since these only work with much slower relays in real life and afaik not with semi-conductors (voltage state issues).  <[newline]> But in LW they are perfectly fine for you, me and most of us. But would you also label them bad practice? (In real life for sure, I am with you there, but in the LW universe?) <[newline]>  <[newline]> But again, we should not call something bad practice or bad or wrong or misleading. Because everyone is free to enjoy using Logic World in any way they like. <[newline]> (And if it works, it works!) <[newline]> ||Idk why, but it seems Jarvi is no longer part of this server, so my messages goes to nothingness. Great...||
CrispyBacon7#9048: Yeah that looks like a bad idea
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Oh wait... An xor doesn't store energy.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I'm actually curious as to the results of that. I've seen that d-latch toggles can be made by routing the q to the data, and they work with short enough clock pulses.
GHXX#9078: logicworld is based on certain assumptions which we can exploit, e.g. discrete states and timesteps
GHXX#9078: and you also cannot do something using reallife logic gates to prove something in a video game
GHXX#9078: i never stated it was a good idea to build an xor flipflip in reallife, but it is a very good and compact way of making a toggle flipflop in LW
GHXX#9078: its like arguing that wires should have a limited length because that would be realistic
GHXX#9078: again, LW != Reallife
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: or you could try to synthesize the vhdl/verilog, but it would fail
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i guess on monday ill pull out a scope and a xor chip and prove it
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you are quite ignorant
Limón#7879: I do not understand the naming of latches/flip flops
GHXX#9078: 'exactly like irl', where all voltages are discrete
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: using a xor in feedback like that is a terrible practice and should be avoided like the plauge, introducing it to new players is even more confounding
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: digital operates exaclty how the IRL component would when programmed to a FPGA
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no
circuitgamer77#0377: It's missing randomness
GHXX#9078: so in a sense the sim program is just missing a feature
GHXX#9078: unless if your timing is perfect
circuitgamer77#0377: Yep
GHXX#9078: you would flip it a random number of times likely
circuitgamer77#0377: It would oscillate IRL, but I'm pretty sure it would settle after a few cycles because the timing isn't exact.
GHXX#9078: its like saying "in Minecraft strip mining is bad because in reallife the mineshaft might collapse"
GHXX#9078: LW != Real Life
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it will oscillate
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: your mechanism does not work irl
GHXX#9078: thus such comparisons make little sense
GHXX#9078: the point is, it DOES work in reallife, but does NOT work in LW
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but ok
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: to remove oscillation
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hence thats why you should use the flip flop component
GHXX#9078: LW doesnt simulate reallife.... you can see that when you build an RS flipflip using two inverters and you supply it with a one tick pulse
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the register is the inherit safe way to do it to prevent oscillations
GHXX#9078: bruh
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: do it irl
GHXX#9078: it is
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: using a xor like that
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah but thats not a stable circuit
GHXX#9078: cuz the other pulseformer can be reused
GHXX#9078: can reset an xor gate using a single additional and gate
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
GHXX#9078: ^^
Dragon Lord#6944: My personal favorite kind of flip flop is a JK flip flop
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Using them you can get 0tick barrel shifters
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Relays make it nice and simple
Prime#8883: I actually have a question of my own. Is there an easier way, in Logic World specifically, to make larger demultiplexers or decoders other than the traditional 1-bit AND NOT demux tree? I mean, obviously there are other ways to do it, but what is practical in this particular case?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the OR gates are obviously free
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but ok
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thats more work than the DFF one <[newline]> edit* i see your reaction ghxx and it literally is
sorgan71#6324: nah the image idgoet posted answered it
Ecconia#4929: Sorry, I do not understand the question
IDoget#3748: boom resetable
sorgan71#6324: so how do you set the 1 pulse one off
Ecconia#4929: There are basically two pulse shortener which matter. <[newline]> The one I sent you is a 1-tick generator. <[newline]> There is also one using a relay and an inverter, which generates a 2-tick pulse. (You also need these sometimes).
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: I have a counter tutorial if you want: https://youtu.be/DfcGGLF5ctY
sorgan71#6324: I didnt know how to shorten pulses
sorgan71#6324: oh i see
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the DFF stores data
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you would still use the pulse shortener on the one that uses a DFF also
sorgan71#6324: Oh i see, so it bypasses the oscilation that other gates experience by only providing it for one tick, thank you ecconita
Prime#8883: Ah well, thanks <@!151293812675706880>
Prime#8883: "self-connected XOR gate" isn't very descriptive of the reality I'm trying to communicate
Prime#8883: Sorry, now that I'm thinking about it, I should have compiled the whole sentence and a picture into a single message.
Ecconia#4929: The only bigger downside to the XOR Toggle-Flip-Flop is, that it is more "difficult" to reset it. But even that is possible.
sorgan71#6324: wait nvm ecconia made one that does it
Ecconia#4929: Yes. Btw I suggest against using a D-Latch for a toggle flip flop. Due to pulse-length. <[newline]> The circuit in the screenshot (originally suggested circuit) is reliable in all situations. <[newline]> With the D-Latch you have more things to consider and more components.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
sorgan71#6324: that made no sense lol
sorgan71#6324: replied to the wrong one
sorgan71#6324: wait
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then every time you clock it, the output will invert
sorgan71#6324: the green has two inputs tho
IDoget#3748: d latches store data when the top is powered. if you connect a button to the top and the input. then the output works as a switch
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then the output of the inverter to the input of the green guy
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: to the input of the inverter
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then connect the output of the DFF(green)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then an inverter
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: place the component
sorgan71#6324: but how does that make a toggle?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yes the green component
sorgan71#6324: like a d-latch?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yes use a data flip flop
Ecconia#4929: Boys BOYS! You know, here is a game chaning LIFEHACK for you: Just make a stupid screenshot! <[newline]> -> <@!195330504021639168> there you go, this is the circuit you need 🙂
sorgan71#6324: yes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: a counter?
sorgan71#6324: but it needs to store numbers
sorgan71#6324: I am trying to make a thing that displays the number of times you have pushed the button
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: push button to toggle requires a toggle flip flop
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i dont understand
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: wym?
sorgan71#6324: ik but i cant use the toggle switch. I'm using this to store numbers in bianary and you cant do that with button switches
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: a data flip flop is a component in game(the green guys)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its in the name ™️
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its called a toggle flip flop
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: that is the toggle switch
sorgan71#6324: not something for generating pulses
sorgan71#6324: no, I mean like something that works like a toggle switch
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: every time you clock it the output toggles
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: a toggle flip flop is the same as a data flip flop, where you invert the output and feed it back to the data input pin
sorgan71#6324: I get the pulse generator but what does that have to do with an input?
sorgan71#6324: wdym?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: use a 1 tick pulse generator and then  a dff with the output inverted and fed back to the input
Prime#8883: Yes, along with a geneator, I was about to say that
Ecconia#4929: ^With monostable (1-tick pulse gen)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: that will oscillate
Prime#8883: A self-connected XOR gate should do it
sorgan71#6324: yeah
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: toggle flip flop
sorgan71#6324: does anybody know how to make a bianary switch? I.E. making the push button behave like the toggle button?
Limón#7879: the world is your oyster
Limón#7879: any
Flampt#3906: what other types of computers can I build other than the SAP-1?
Erikbot#6368: In risc-v you have about 12 bits, or 11 if you want a signed number. This makes it possible to address 4096 bytes relative to some pointer.
Ecconia#4929: Given you have enough bits for the offset, like even object programming and access to C structs pretty much use this Offset. If it is too small you pretty much loose almost all of its advantage. ||I assume by using my knowledge and experience.||
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: That's called base+offset addressing and is very powerful. It how MIPS and RISCV set up software stacks and memory data structures.
Erikbot#6368: array indexing is just about calculating the address in memory that you want to change/read. if the array `a` is at address `123`, then `a[5]` accesses the address `123+5=128`. in risc-v, the load/store instructions allow you to specify and address with a constant offset to a register, `lw <register to store in> <constant> <offset register>`. if you know that your array will be in a fixed memory location (static memory), then you can make the constant the start of the array to allow you to  address an arbitrary location in the array.
Loafus#3398: should i just be convering to 1d indexing or am i missing something obvious
Loafus#3398: does anyone have an efficient way to do array indexing?
Stenodyon#8192: I'm more of a mujer than a hombre but you're welcome 😄
Loafus#3398: thanks hombres 👍
Loafus#3398: awesome okay
Stenodyon#8192: It takes 1 tick to open or close the relay, but when it's closed the data signal can pass through instantly and both ways as if it was a wire
LOOPS#1372: I just did a test, and set my game to 3 ticks per second. like 7  gates in series, the relay is  indeed  instant while the and gates have delay
Loafus#3398: might have been a bogus test
Loafus#3398: I did a test and if both the data and the control signal are being passed in the same tick, the AND gate relays a signal faster
LOOPS#1372: As far as I am aware relays are instant while AND gates take 1 tick
Loafus#3398: hey, whats the difference between a relay and an and gate? I've always used and gates because of the smaller profile but im curious as to whether there might be a reason to use relays
Jimmy#8080: Universal Render Pipeline
mitolegy#5916: yeah ok this is way better then whatever i was doing. my circuit doing the same was this big
mitolegy#5916: ive never seen that component somehow
mitolegy#5916: oh ok i see
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: xor
mitolegy#5916: whats the blue thing
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: nah vanilla
mitolegy#5916: using mod components?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 3tick clock speed
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i have an up/down counter with branching tutorial: <[newline]> https://youtu.be/DfcGGLF5ctY
mitolegy#5916: program counter
Erikbot#6368: what specifically do you need a programmable counter to do?
mitolegy#5916: they're also massive
mitolegy#5916: anyone got a good programmable counter circuit? i tried making one out of a regular JK master slave flip flops. but it keeps spazzing out if the clock signal isn't proper, which it isnt a lot of the time.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: same way i dealt with it in tung lol. new board
circuitgamer77#0377: Does anyone have a workaround for when a board can't be resized, but you can still see the arrow and there is nothing attached?
Ecconia#4929: Yes! But its not easy.
BolkeDer#6969: nice jsut in the menu
Ecconia#4929: You mean the information which is displayed in the multiplayer menu, or more? <[newline]> Cause if its just the information from the server list, I can help you - wrote a custom client and server (these connect to official client/server but are super incomplete [with verified mode]).
BolkeDer#6969: ok thanks
GHXX#9078: youd need to do some digging through code, but id say it should be possible very likely
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ```ListPlayers```
BolkeDer#6969: is there a way to send a request to a server to get status/latency/player status
Limón#7879: I noticed i just never said
CrispyPin#1149: the screenshots in <#903124059255078943> yesterday are also comic mono
CrispyPin#1149: surprised you only noticed it now
Erikbot#6368: Because comic mono is the greatest font.
Limón#7879: why is there comic sans
CrispyPin#1149: 
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Imagine LARPing in Logic World
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: In my head I read that as Logic World Role Play
CrispyPin#1149: the LWRP
Erikbot#6368: probably the default.
00asdf#7469: which unity render pipeline does LW use?
Dragon Lord#6944: I think we would need the negative one tic delayer for that kind of production quality
Ecconia#4929: <@!128545421579517952> Does the LICC framework support comments in the auto-load file? <[newline]> I would like to quickly modify the content, without having another file to store the working commands.
circuitgamer77#0377: Let's build a circuit to do that!
Erikbot#6368: the game should simply predict the behavior of all other players so that no connection is required.
circuitgamer77#0377: Unless everyone is playing on the same computer.
circuitgamer77#0377: That would have been impressive :)
Ecconia#4929: Oops, fixed.
ThaCuber#5611: > No, the game does not need a network connection for playing multiplayer. <[newline]> <:megathink:797979154549178399>
Ecconia#4929: No, the game does not need a network connection for playing \***singleplayer**. <[newline]> But however it is a "bug" that it refuses to start, if there is no network. <[newline]> So this is a matter of fixing a bug.
ThaCuber#5611: can't there be, idk, some offline mode or something?
ThaCuber#5611: *bruh*
James0007#2836: Thanks. :)
James0007#2836: Indeed.
Ecconia#4929: The game uses network internally (To connect to the internal server). <[newline]> And the code is not perfect yet, so it kind of searches for an active network connection (outgoing). <[newline]> Else it crashes, or does not start. <[newline]> But rest assured, this game does not abuse the network connection. <[newline]> But when you have no network/wifi/lan available, that's a bad situation.
James0007#2836: Why can't I start the game offline? o.O
IDoget#3748: its just a python script that reads top left to bottom right and inputs a button on my keyboard
IDoget#3748: it should be able to animate a couple frames a second
IDoget#3748: ill leave my computer on overnight for the animating
IDoget#3748: takes like a hour or 2 for 128 bits across 128 tiles
Dragon Lord#6944: i got into the flow for the input panel on the one i showed. still took much longer than copy pasting the frames
IDoget#3748: you would be surprised how little time it takes once you get into the flow
IDoget#3748: nah
Dragon Lord#6944: that's just it though... you have to connect all those things you're copy pasting
IDoget#3748: which i should be able to write whole frames at once
IDoget#3748: its just copy and pasting and the write system now
IDoget#3748: what i just built was pretty much already the whole thing
Dragon Lord#6944: that's going to be REALLY painful to build unless you get your script to do that too
IDoget#3748: they cause too much lag
IDoget#3748: i dont use sockets
IDoget#3748: mine is like 2 components, 4 pegs per pixel per frame
Dragon Lord#6944: i think it was ~3 components, 2 pegs, and 2 sockets per pixel per frame
IDoget#3748: smaller then just 1 of mine 🤣
Dragon Lord#6944: like i said, not even close to optimal, but this was one of my first builds in LW
IDoget#3748: 8 bits of frames...
IDoget#3748: im going to write a python program to animate frames in seconds
IDoget#3748: because im expecting a HUGE project
IDoget#3748: but will also be more spread out
IDoget#3748: mine are 1x1 tiles
IDoget#3748: hmm
Dragon Lord#6944: each pixel was 2x2 tiles
Dragon Lord#6944: mine was 16x16 iirc
IDoget#3748: im working on 64x64 rn
IDoget#3748: whats the screen res
Dragon Lord#6944: the 28 frame one i did is a bit sketchy on older hardware, but it's able to run
IDoget#3748: and the game saves d latch states on the drve
IDoget#3748: i have it set to write in sequence
IDoget#3748: it'll be fine
IDoget#3748: ehh
IDoget#3748: didn't think of that
IDoget#3748: OH FUCK
Dragon Lord#6944: i meant your *computer's* ram lol
IDoget#3748: when you said good luck on the ram... I was not expecting this
IDoget#3748: will do
Dragon Lord#6944: good luck on the ram lol
IDoget#3748: will look at how you made the screen
IDoget#3748: thanks anyways
IDoget#3748: would be great but im gonna need closer to 60000 frames
Dragon Lord#6944: <@!343494521796952072> here it is if you decide you want to give it a look. no pressure :) <[newline]> https://logicworld.net/view/ctn-5035023a
Dragon Lord#6944: (very unoptimal, but was fun to build)
Dragon Lord#6944: just for a *very* novel idea for inspiration lol
Dragon Lord#6944: I have an animation tool you can take a look at if you want :)
IDoget#3748: i have a idea ty
IDoget#3748: i wonder what i could use for animation
IDoget#3748: so depends on the use case
IDoget#3748: hmm
Dragon Lord#6944: there are just a lot of different things that different people choose to optimise for
Dragon Lord#6944: maybe you want to draw lines, or different colors (multiple bits per pixel), or maybe you want it to be a circular shift register for each row (useful in some text editing applications), or maybe you want a single pixel to be as small as possible, ... etc
IDoget#3748: and you can say 10 across and 4 up
IDoget#3748: 4 bits tall 4 bits wide
IDoget#3748: so like if you wanted it to be a x, y grid
Dragon Lord#6944: sometimes you want to write to it in different ways
IDoget#3748: isn't a screen just d latches? why do people complicate them so much?
NeverCast#1448: Thanks for that, I'll look at mods a little later today - switches and and gates for now then
Ecconia#4929: For that you would need to install a mod. <[newline]> I do not know who made a ROM mod, but have a look at: <#910673109164638239> and <#901659878869844048>. <[newline]> Someone who knows might answer to your question too.
NeverCast#1448: Couldn't see anything conclusive in the chat history. Hi I'm new here, can I add a LUT or ROM in game?
Erikbot#6368: [REDACTED] machine
ThaCuber#5611: so, you will be left with **__~~T H E V O I D~~__**?
Ecconia#4929: Turing things only break stuff anyway
Erikbot#6368: It can be proven that it is not possible to solve the halting problem using a turing machine, so I will remove the turing part of my cpu.
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Someone should make a machine to solve the halting problem in logic world

Verlio_H#0201: Esperanto, Klingon, Lojban, Toki Pona, and Quenya are already on the localizor
Limón#7879: can we translate the game to a conlang
Jimmy#8080: Thank you for your help translating <@!595039976509538381> , much appreciated! If you link your Localizor account to your discord account, I can give you the fun purple "translator" role here :)
Jimmy#8080: Indeed, Spanish is at 19.3% of keys translated, the threshold for inclusion in the game is 20%
DanielGJ44#4557: I guess they gotta get it done
DanielGJ44#4557: I find it difficult to believe that Spanish is not already in the game
ThaCuber#5611: i wanna translate for it, so it gets faster to the game
ThaCuber#5611: epic
Verlio_H#0201: once it reaches 20% on localizor (https://www.localizor.com/logic-world) it will be added as a WIP language
ThaCuber#5611: Hello, does someone know when is Spanish going to be in-game? For me it kind of doesn't make sense that a language as used as Spanish isn't in the game since the start. (I'm a Spanish speaker, so it's easier for me to read Spanish than it is to read English)

Michael#8718: For reference, this is the technical document.  It refers to memory as two delay lines.  I guess that's possible, and it would explain the serial nature of the CPU
Michael#8718: I am not even sure how that works, but reading a technical guide on the computer right now
Michael#8718: Wondering if anyone has tried to build a computer like that, in Logic World?
Michael#8718: It seems it was serial, taking 8 clock cycles to read/write a byte
Michael#8718: I have been reading a bit on Kenbak-1, the first personal computer

TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i forgot to put pegs on the input on that but im sure you get it lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yea one sec i gotchu
circuitgamer77#0377: Can I see a screenshot sometime?  I'm on my phone at the moment, but I'm planning to work on it when I get back.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i have 3 tick synced 1 tick piped, but i cant speed it up anymore while maintaining that pipeline
circuitgamer77#0377: Most of the design is fine, but just that one component...
circuitgamer77#0377: There's one spot that I haven't found a way to reduce to a 1 tick input.
circuitgamer77#0377: Does anyone have a 2 tick ICA that is 1 tick synced?  I haven't gotten past 3 tick with a 2 tick input required.  (I've also been away from the game for a bit, but I'm back now). I thought my design was 2 tick with 1 tick sync, but it turns out it isn't.
Saltypretzel#0321: I personally think that ICAs have quite similar construction to RCAs. I feel like other CLA topologies differ quite a lot from a hardware component standpoint
ThePiGuy24#0369: just replace adders with oracles, only one tick of delay and they are right `1/(2^bits)*100`% of the time :D
Erikbot#6368: recursively buy more calculators and replace their adders with calculators.
DanielGJ44#4557: Problem solved, discussion over
DanielGJ44#4557: Simple solution: just use a calculator as an adder, you can literally get them from the dollar store
MichaelBot#9291: simple solution, a RCA is a CLA with 1 layer and a block size of 1, everyone is happy
Stenodyon#8192: I absolutely *can* judge your technical opinions and if both of you can't have this debate in a civil manner staff *will* have the last word
Ecconia#4929: Oh, I am pretty calm and relaxed, thanks for asking. <[newline]> I wished that others would be so too. <[newline]> Well Staff sadly cannot judge our technical opinions, so they won't have the last word there. They can only move it. If it does not happen in a calm manner. <[newline]> Again, I want to focus on Displays right now and not Adders, hence I will delay further discussion.
nemerod#0256: go test and have fun everyone 🙂 <[newline]>  <[newline]> topic closed for me, dont ping me again thank for no restart the topic <[newline]> the moderator give the last word anyway, thank Sten (Emily)
nemerod#0256: man, please calm and relaxe, play we just here for explain, and i'm sure the dev/admin/moderator have last word
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hmm yeah so hysterical
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: " a relay has no gate delay on its critical path. a and gate does."
Ecconia#4929: ^Sorry but that is hysterical. Take a breather, take time, think.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: also sorry if dude is offensive, i just needed some way to start my sentance
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: dude, an and gate and a relay have the same logical function. a relay has no gate delay on its critical path. an and gate does. i sent schem and proved that ICA was RCA with a relay instead of AND gate
Stenodyon#8192: I'd be interested in that, I agree with Jarvi on this (and calling him "hysterical" is uncalled for)
Ecconia#4929: <@!277044140238176256> What do you mean? Again Jarvi is wrong, and not judging properly on an abstract layer. <[newline]> But I currently have no time to write a huge paragraph explaining the differences. <[newline]> I could do that later or tomorrow. Especially because Jarvi is hysterically attempting to weirdly argue his point again. <[newline]> Point is, you can view this topic from different angles, and he does not quite make his standpoint clear, but claims again that it is the truth. Which is a problem. Obviously I have a different standpoint and could elaborate it clear and properly. Like he can't.
nemerod#0256: <@!151293812675706880> <[newline]> it's okey and better ? 🙂
nemerod#0256: and after, it's basic wire
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ICA can be built IRL using relays
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: they only chage is replacing a relay with an AND gate to convert from ICA to RCA
nemerod#0256: the top need 1 tick for connect the side 1 & 2 in internal
Erikbot#6368: A LUT that stores all possible combinations of inputs would not ripple
Ecconia#4929: Wow, I could send a schem too. <[newline]> But I think Jarvi and I both know the schematics of several adders quite well. <[newline]> Which does not change how their IO function. Only highlights how they work internally.
nemerod#0256: the relay no have delay side 1 and side 2 if the top = ON
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: chain them
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: unless you use relays which have no gate delay, then its instant ripple
Erikbot#6368: A LUT adder would not ripple
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it will ripple
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if you tie cin to cout
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yea
nemerod#0256: TheWildJarvi posted the true schem, and i agree with him
Erikbot#6368: so a LUT adder would be an RCA?
nemerod#0256: you dont know with your message you made from one moment now
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the only difference is no gate delay vs gate delay
Ecconia#4929: It is an adder
Ecconia#4929: OFC it is
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the logic is the same
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the truth table is the same
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: they do
Erikbot#6368: just because some circuits are combinatorially equal does not mean that they perform the same function.
Ecconia#4929: <@!277044140238176256> I am not questioning that ICAs are working. I know that ICAs work.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: RCA and ICA are like brothers and are farther from CLA than eachother
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if you cant see that then im sorry, but youre wrong
nemerod#0256: <@!151293812675706880><@!121786044197765131><@!358990534619955200> <[newline]> go to the solo <[newline]> make the build and open the console and enter the commande <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> server simulation.rate 2 <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> and have fun
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: anywway, they are logically the same, the only difference is gate delay vs no gate delay
Ecconia#4929: You do not need to convince me here. <[newline]> Obviously you are just now questioning the difference of adders by their functionality. The Truth Tables of adders are all the same, or the adder is broken.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the truth tables are equivalent
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah logicallly they are the same
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: PROVE ME WRONG
Erikbot#6368: they are only combinatorially equal
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: MAKE THE TRUTH TABLE
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: IRL AND GATES AND RELAYS PERFORM THE SAME LOGICAL FUNCTION
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the  <[newline]> ANd gate has delay on both
Ecconia#4929: No they do not.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the relay has no gate delay on one pin
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: AND
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the relay and the AND gate both perform the same logical function
Erikbot#6368: Ecconia is right
nemerod#0256: i tested the schem and he work
GHXX#9078: replacing a component in a gate doesnt mean its still basically the same as the previous gate.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: dude grow up
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: replace the relay with an AND gate and you have RCA
Ecconia#4929: Learn your basics.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm yeah it does lmfao
Ecconia#4929: Schem = Proof, yeah sure.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: I posted schem
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its really clear
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: dude, youre wrong
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: CLA does not
Ecconia#4929: Do not "no dude" me. You are quite wrong here **again**. <[newline]> I can write it down to you later.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the RCA and ICA share the same logic
nemerod#0256: the relay need 1 tick for connect side 1 with side 2, but after connected, the data send in 0 tick
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: all adders have 3 stages <[newline]> input xor, carry logic, output xor
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no dude, theyre one in the same, where as with CLA, the middle carry stages are different than RCA
Ecconia#4929: Yet that is two different ways to approach it. Be more precise. <[newline]> What you claim here is simply overlooking how it technically works.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ICA is RCA where there is no ripple due to no gate delay
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: relay has no gate delay
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: both relay and AND gate perform AND function
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and gate has gate delay
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: relay has no gate delay
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i just explained it
Ecconia#4929: That does not change, that the fundamental of the carry transmission in this is entirely different.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: replace that relay with an AND gate and you have RCA. the only difference between RCA and ICA is that the ripple has no propogation time because the relay has no gate delay
Ecconia#4929: Picture = proof, yeah sure
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: prove it wrong
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: I posted a picture
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: CLA does not have more in common with ICA than RCA lmfao, just stating this proves you dont know the differences
Ecconia#4929: False lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: carry lookaheads can be thought of as a ROM holding all the precomputed carries in its carry table
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: replace that relay with an AND gate and you return to RCA
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: where the second and gate is replaced by a relay rather than AND gate
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ICA is RCA
Ecconia#4929: I do not think so. <[newline]> A RippleCarryAdder hands over the carry up the Full-Adder chain, by passing it through logic gates. <[newline]> An InstantCarryAdder opens or closes one single carry wire, without explicitly using gates within. It does not ripple through gates, the electrons instead flow in a wire. And there is not particular starting point, it happens simultaneously. <[newline]> CarryLookAhead adders however dump more gates (or wires) on the problem of transferring the carry to have a higher speed than a normal RippleCarryAdder. <[newline]> You could treat each of these three as their own class. While there are still several sub-classes of CarryLookAhead adders. But these all derive from an Adder but not exactly from each other. Only the way they handle carry differentiates them, and these 3 attempts are quite different. CLA has more in common with RCA than ICA does.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Where the ripple is instant....
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Which is a form of rca
Erikbot#6368: *ICA
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thats not look ahead. its a form of RCA
Erikbot#6368: if the carry is carried with a relay, the "lookahead" of the circuit will be infinite.
PseudoGoose#2841: I think you want to have the lookahead units as big as possible, and ripple as few times as possible. 4-bit CLA is definitely doable.
LOOPS#1372: When making a carry lookahead adder, should I do 8 groups of 2 adders or 4 groups of 4 adders?? I understand there are benefits to both, but which has the least worst-case delay?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Type help in the console window
MichaelBot#9291: is there a list anywhere of server commands?
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> I do have a question regarding the future version releases. <[newline]> From what I heard you will not release "small" Steam updates, but instead have them on some test-branch in Steam (They call it "betas"). <[newline]> Means that if we do not switch the version ("beta") manually, the next update would be 0.91? <[newline]> Given this is correct, did you consider to make one further release on the "main" branch (non-"beta"), which fixes several "needed" bugs? <[newline]>  <[newline]> Cause there are a dozen small ones, like for example that the game dies (stackoverflow) if one wants to have `noclip` automatically turned on when flying. [And the loading bug, if it is as simple to fix as I heard (Gnogs mod)] <[newline]> These could be wrapped up in one or two weeks and be a pleasure for all of us. <[newline]> Feel free to ask for a list of such bugs, or ask if your list of issues is complete enough.
MichaelBot#9291: xnor
GUMMYCAT#6001: the inputs of xnor both go to one peg, i would need buffers to use that making it not one tick.  unless the inputs both come directly from output pegs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: now i feel dumb ;-;
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: why didnt i think of this <:facepalm:585537545702473749>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: bro omg i was being dumb, this wikll enable me to have a 2 tick decrementer :o
Erikbot#6368: If I run the game at many different TPS and do a proportional regression I *might* be able to measure the impact of the simulation itself, since the other parts *should* remain constant.
GHXX#9078: and in your process-cpu time you will probably also see the times of those other threads that have nothing to do with logic updates
GHXX#9078: not sure if logic updating has its own thread, but it is done by one thread, which may or may not do other stuff too. But the point is, there are other threads which definitely do not do logic updates
Erikbot#6368: Most accurate way is probably to decompile the game and figure out the algorithms used.
Erikbot#6368: or is component logic in it's own thread?
Erikbot#6368: I also care somewhat about the other stuff since it also impacts how quickly the circuits can run.
GHXX#9078: not in time that is taken up by some network thread
GHXX#9078: but you are only really intersted in the time that the component logic update took
Erikbot#6368: the kernel keeps the times separate, but there is some amount of noise produced from switching processes.
GHXX#9078: as it would include other threads aswell
GHXX#9078: but that would be inaccurate
Erikbot#6368: well I could just run the server as a separate process and measure the CPU time it uses.
GHXX#9078: but its probs better to base it off of the time it took to update
GHXX#9078: would probs be doable using a harmony mod which edits some game code
Limón#7879: but with that you would probably have to edit existing code
Limón#7879: log every tick how many components updated
Limón#7879: with a mod probably
Erikbot#6368: Is there currently a way to get an average of the number of updating components? I want to optimize my circuits for the server performance.
Erikbot#6368: You can already make 1 tick xnor/nand gates with existing gates, in fact it is possible to transform any combinatoric circuit into a 1 tick circuit (with some effort) since the relays and buffers are instant.
Alskis#8118: I'd do too, I just wanted outputs working
CrispyPin#1149: i would use switches behind relays for easy programming
Alskis#8118: 
Alskis#8118: I'm inexperienced in logic gates, is this how you guys make rom
Stefan#5422: Thank you daniel, very cool.
DanielGJ44#4557: He learned from me
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Hey Jimmy, how did you get to be so cool?
Jimmy#8080: improvements to this system are coming in 0.91 :)
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Can ticks per second be shown just like fps?
Jaken#3572: Solved the problem!
Jaken#3572: So I have put a world folder in the saves folder but when I start the game the world doesn't appear. Anyone know how to fix this?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Apparently, you are supposed to use the white buffers for that.
Akshay#2319: Delayer I can only set minimum of 2? I remember being able to set 1
binaryclock03#5762: buffer
Akshay#2319: how do i prevent it from flowing back (the blue arrow)
Jaken#3572: yes thank you, think we solved it that way
CrispyPin#1149: yes, you can convert a save to gridlands by changing `WorldTypeID: MHG.Grasslands`  to `WorldTypeID: MHG.Gridlands` in `saves/World/worldinfo.succ`
Jaken#3572: can you make so that the default server isn't grass world?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: What if the colors were inverted
Reese4221#8317: they look so cool
Reese4221#8317: why cant we have really dark boards?
Reese4221#8317: but why
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: But if you allow yourself mods then yes
Jimmy#8080: Undecided but I'm leaning towards no
Satan#9850: will we got any other more complicated logic gates in the future?
Jimmy#8080: hmm sounds like a bug, the only restriction on colors should be for boards (to prevent them being too dark to see the grid lines)
Jimmy#8080: I am not planning to add xnor/nand in vanilla. These operations do indeed take 2 ticks, and that's a design consideration you have to work around.
Jimmy#8080: In the in-game About menu, check the "Roadmap" tab :)
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Ah, cool
RyanT#1426: no, but Jimmy said it would return in February
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Is logic world Wednesday still a thing somewhere
CrispyPin#1149: they can be made to take 1 tick
CrispyPin#1149: a lookup table
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Queuing literally every possible operation ahead of time. /s
Ecconia#4929: plumbing
Reese4221#8317: pipelining
autistic.sack.of.friends#0001: wait wasn't there a way to do a 1 tick adder or something
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Do we have a master list of things coming in the next version of Logic World?
GHXX#9078: no, for displays
PseudoGoose#2841: If it's something else, that is probably a bug then
PseudoGoose#2841: For coloring boards? I think there is a minimum brightness for those
GHXX#9078: also, how come one cannot choose an rgb value where all channels are below a certain value? e.g. setting the color #010101 does not work and instead sets it to something higher?
GUMMYCAT#6001: will xnor/nand ever be added, or a way to invert the output of the xor/and. would be useful to have an xnor output in 1 tick withoud adding a tick with an inverter
Jimmy#8080: Yes, I'm planning on this for the future :)
binaryclock03#5762: while you're here, if I make configs for rgb color any chance we can have it included as one of the base game configs? Like one of these
Jimmy#8080: <@!204460961686487040> go to `saves/your save name here/ExtraData/MHG.Displays`, you'll find that data in an easy format there
binaryclock03#5762: awesome
DanielGJ44#4557: So I would imagine the answer is still yes
DanielGJ44#4557: I know during beta that was for sure possible, and I know you can open the config file in notepad
binaryclock03#5762: is there a way to edit a panel config using a file editor? I want to make a config for a 8 input panel but dont want to go through the pain of manually doing it
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Are client side only mods a thing?
Verlio_H#0201: i made one in tung at one point, never finished sqrt or div though just add sub and mlt
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Found it: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/929492717329866772
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Has anyone done a floating point unit yet?
GHXX#9078: im pretty sure the game automatically creates backups though? So if you manage to corrupt your world, what you actually want to do is backup your backups folder before trying to fix it, so you wont loose the backups while you are trying to fix the world by loading one of the backups
DanielGJ44#4557: Very true. You can't just simply copy/paste SOLIDWORKS models either, they need to be exported or the dependencies break. Pretty common for programs to not necessarily work that way
Ecconia#4929: There might be side effects, so one cannot just do that. Sure most games allow that. But some have the saves listed in some other file. <[newline]> So the question is justified. And then one even learns, that the game does backups by itself already...
DanielGJ44#4557: that sounds a little condescending
BitorBit#6268: how to backup world/s: <[newline]> 1. go to saves folder <[newline]> 2. copy your world/s <[newline]> 3. save them on another location <[newline]> 4. be sad because you did not know how simple that was to save backup
DanielGJ44#4557: Small squares are 0.3m I believe
Biggycheese69420#4947: you're welcome
Jaken#3572: thanks for the help
Jaken#3572: no worries
Jaken#3572: ok
Biggycheese69420#4947: I don't know the size of each block though
Jaken#3572: one small
Jaken#3572: and is one square 1 m
Biggycheese69420#4947: the world is 30000 km^3
Jaken#3572: okay good to know
Biggycheese69420#4947: yes
Jaken#3572: is there a world border?
Jaken#3572: okay👍
Biggycheese69420#4947: you can also just hit the open file on the world in game
Jaken#3572: Thanks!
Ecconia#4929: (Steam -> Logic World -> Show local files) <[newline]> Next to the `saves` folder, where your worlds are in, there is `backups`.
Jaken#3572: where do you find the backups?
Jaken#3572: oh sweet
Biggycheese69420#4947: it automatically does it every so often
Jaken#3572: Is it possible to backup a world?
CrispyPin#1149: not yet, coming in 0.91
BitorBit#6268: is there a way to save sircut from singleplayer or another server and load it to another server or singleplayer?
circuitgamer77#0377: Sorry I couldn't help much...
BlockOfGaming#7101: Ok
BlockOfGaming#7101: I'm literally playing on an intel NUC
circuitgamer77#0377: I need to vanish for class now, but I'll be back in a few hours most likely.
BlockOfGaming#7101: Yeah
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm not great with sightreading specs though - I have a general idea but not the details.  I spotted that it was integrated graphics though.
BlockOfGaming#7101: I don't have a gpu, it's built-in to the cpu
circuitgamer77#0377: I did, but if you said it wasn't using as much graphics processor I was thinking you could turn that part up.
BlockOfGaming#7101: Yeah, F3
BlockOfGaming#7101: I don't think you looked close enough at the specs I showed
circuitgamer77#0377: Check controls - I think it's a keybind.
circuitgamer77#0377: You could probably turn up some of the graphics settings if you wanted, just to get as much out of it as possible.  There's a few that would definetly increase the CPU, but some are mostly GPU.
BlockOfGaming#7101: Where'd the fps counter I turned on before go tho
circuitgamer77#0377: Ah, I don't know much about linux...  Some, I've used it in a VM, but not much.
BlockOfGaming#7101: I think all 4 I've got on my cpu, Idk tho, I don't see a way to see which ones it's using (I'm on linux not windows)
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm not surprised...  (this question isn't to help much but I'm curious about something - how many cores is Logic World using?)
BlockOfGaming#7101: Where did my fps counter go
BlockOfGaming#7101: Logic world is using 1.4 GB of ram ;-;, and a LOT of my cpu
circuitgamer77#0377: If it's CPU only, some graphics settings might not be a problem.
circuitgamer77#0377: What components of your computer are maxing out?
BlockOfGaming#7101: Maybe
circuitgamer77#0377: 30 is tiny, but if you're willing to compromise and that helps, maybe it's an option?
BlockOfGaming#7101: Wait, no, I lowered it to 300
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know if I can help with your problem...  You tried lowering render distance to 30?  That's the only other thing I would try...
BlockOfGaming#7101: I literally can barely do anything in other apps
BlockOfGaming#7101: For me it's a problem
circuitgamer77#0377: But it is noticable.
circuitgamer77#0377: Not enough to be a problem for me though.
circuitgamer77#0377: My game slows down my PC when I run it, and I have 64 gig of RAM, a Ryzen 5 (the weak point), and a RTX 3060, although it seems to do pretty well with not crashing on slower computers.
BlockOfGaming#7101: Apart from memory they're really bad
BlockOfGaming#7101: 
BlockOfGaming#7101: They're really bad
circuitgamer77#0377: What're your PC specs?
circuitgamer77#0377: From what I've noticed and heard other people mention, a lot of the processing goes to the colliders, so turning down graphics was mostly hopeful.
BlockOfGaming#7101: And I turned off most graphics settings
BlockOfGaming#7101: Yes, I put the resolution to the lowest 16:9 ratio I found
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm assuming you've tried lowering the graphics settings?
circuitgamer77#0377: Don't know about that one - the game uses quite a lot of computing power to run.
BlockOfGaming#7101: How do I make it so other apps are usable while the game is on, currently while the game is on any other apps are really really laggy
circuitgamer77#0377: (I can answer more questions if you have them and ask them soon, but I have class in about 20 minutes, so I'm going to vanish at some point)
circuitgamer77#0377: NYI, but soon.
BlockOfGaming#7101: How do I save a board
circuitgamer77#0377: Control enables fine placement for any component that supports it.
BlockOfGaming#7101: Oh
circuitgamer77#0377: Also control
BlockOfGaming#7101: I can't find anywhere how to do that
BlockOfGaming#7101: How do I put multiple sockets on the same grid space
circuitgamer77#0377: You can also connect a line of pegs together by selecting all but one end for the first group, then selecting all but the other end for the second group.
circuitgamer77#0377: Hold control (or whatever your mod key is if you changed it)

BlockOfGaming#7101: How do I do multiwiring
BlockOfGaming#7101: Redstone tps is 10 :)
BitorBit#6268: that tps is perfect to me
BitorBit#6268: put TPS to 240(8x faster)
BlockOfGaming#7101: Which has a 1 tick delay
BlockOfGaming#7101: While the buffer is basically just a diode
BlockOfGaming#7101: The fast buffer is basically just an instant diode
circuitgamer77#0377: 30 is the default
circuitgamer77#0377: I forgot the number :)  Replace the 30 with the TPS you want.
circuitgamer77#0377: `server "simulation.rate 30"`
circuitgamer77#0377: wait
circuitgamer77#0377: `server "simulation.rate"` in console
BlockOfGaming#7101: How do I change the tps
BlockOfGaming#7101: Just saw that in the help menu
Biggycheese69420#4947: T
BlockOfGaming#7101: How do I rotate a circuit board to be horizontal
MS#5409: Wdym?
Ecconia#4929: In theory it should be possible to use an external tool to edit the settings file, since the game reloads files immediately. Not sure if that works with settings too.
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Can you change run speed via commands? I know you can do in in the settings
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Was midi disabled in game? I remember reading something about buttons supporting midi
Jimmy#8080: Coming in 0.91 :)
GHXX#9078: officially, not yet afaik
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Can you save subassemblies?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Theoretically, if they were removed from the game code, would it break anything on the server?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: <@!327048348303622145> can we use through sockets on your server?
Jimmy#8080: There should be no issues with this. However keep in mind that a server owner might not want you using secret components.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ticks per second
HuntaBadday#3556: What is the speed setting measured in?
Wessel#9460: Thanks <@!548699973672370222> I finally get it, it was late for me yesterday and it didn't click for me.
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Can through hole sockets be placed on unmodified servers or with that cause issues / fail?
circuitgamer77#0377: Input on the front:
circuitgamer77#0377: Here's how that would look (double the number of modules though - I only made half):
circuitgamer77#0377: You can connect the input to the front and stack them backwards for more addresses.
circuitgamer77#0377: Here's a (not compacted) tileable version:
Wessel#9460: 
Wessel#9460: I made an like hand programmable eeprom
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Do you have a ram already made?
Wessel#9460: you dont even know how confused i am getting maybe becouse it is 12:51 AM for me
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll make a small tillable version for you in a moment, I need to load the game again.
circuitgamer77#0377: In my case, I have the second input for the XORs go to a set of switches on top of each address, which I set to the address of that slice.
Wessel#9460: how do you assign an adress mannually
circuitgamer77#0377: You could assign addresses manually (more compact), or what I did (way bigger and more complicated) is have an adder on every address to increment the next address by 1, so it figures out its address automatically.
circuitgamer77#0377: If you want this to work for addressing RAM or something like that, you would need one of these per address.
Wessel#9460: how does the circuit know it is line 1 and i has to decode 1
Wessel#9460: i'm sorry I do not understand
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: It's a one hot decoder....
circuitgamer77#0377: You would need one of these per address
circuitgamer77#0377: One per output line
Wessel#9460: shouldnt i get more outputs
circuitgamer77#0377: The logic is basically saying "if none of the inputs are not right, output true"
Wessel#9460: i dont think i under stand how it works
circuitgamer77#0377: Here's a non-configurable version - put inverters on the lines that should be 1, and buffers on the lines that should be 0 (this one matches 0101):
circuitgamer77#0377: This is the xor version - it checks if both inputs match, so it's a configurable demux:
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm building a version that's easier to see right now - my normal version is super compacted.
Wessel#9460: alright could you show it?
circuitgamer77#0377: My preferred version is the xor version, but it is usually a bit bigger in size.  It means I don't have to build a different circuit for every single value though.
Wessel#9460: lol indian dude
Wessel#9460: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3Ed13z9uz8
Wessel#9460: like this but with much more inputs and and gates
Wessel#9460: lol i was thinking before this to use a hell lot of and gates for each output
Wessel#9460: okay i appreciate it!
circuitgamer77#0377: Give me about 5 minutes :)
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll show you both in a bit - I'm about to get back to my computer.
circuitgamer77#0377: Demultiplexer - use either inverted/not inverted inputs, then invert the output, or you can use xors then invert if you want it to be modular or more flexible.
Wessel#9460: yeah it would be handy to use on a ram
RyanT#1426: Id show u one if i wasnt on my phone
Wessel#9460: thanks
RyanT#1426: That's called a demux
Wessel#9460: out of the 16 cables
Wessel#9460: like 0011 would turn on 1 cable
Wessel#9460: Is there a good way to convert binary to individual bits
TelePotato#0001: i literally have no clue sometimes what the builtin parser supports because nothing ever seems to tell me
TelePotato#0001: is joke btw cause there are so many ini parsers
TelePotato#0001: have you ever considered ini with a custom parser
Jimmy#8080: I was dissatisfied with the existing DSLs (JSON, XML, YAML etc -- they all have some flaw) and instead of compromising I decided to just make my own
Jimmy#8080: thank you
TelePotato#0001: m, is perfection
Wessel#9460: Jimmy made the .succ himself
TelePotato#0001: whos idea was it to use the .succ format?
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: How do i teleport to a player? if i use `tp [player name in chat]` it says it cant find the player, which name am i supposed to use?
TelePotato#0001: so drag it out to the mods folder and then delete the empty folder
TelePotato#0001: theres a good chance that the unzipping put it into a folder inside that folder
TelePotato#0001: look inside the mod's folder
TelePotato#0001: restart game
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Is there something I'm missing about installing mods? I extracted the zip and dropped its contents in the mods folder.
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I wonder who's gonna install Linux first
MichaelBot#9291: If we can't make a cluster with Apache Spark, I'm out 🙂
GHXX#9078: <:rooW1:580615576120983552>
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: See this
GHXX#9078: wait a second, campaign confirmed?
GHXX#9078: ew
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Imagine having to install java
Dragon Lord#6944: it's going to require making a multi-instanced vm server
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Is the campaign mode gonna require building a computer to win?
nemerod#0256: he work ?
nemerod#0256: edit the key H with what you want 🙂
nemerod#0256: enter the first commande then use the 2nd for check if you write well the string 🙂
nemerod#0256: ``` <[newline]> commandbindings.add "H" 'server "step"' <[newline]>  <[newline]> commandbindings.list <[newline]> ```
nemerod#0256: (2 sec, i search the info for you and try if correct)
nemerod#0256: you can on the console
nemerod#0256: if i have good memory you can add your commande with keybinding inside the consol
circuitgamer77#0377: I know how to bind keys to commands as well (or at least I know where to find how)
circuitgamer77#0377: I know the simulation.rate one, but knowing the step command is nice
nemerod#0256: button keybinding with what you want ?
nemerod#0256: oh, on ingame ?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: What if you had a button to run simulation.step
nemerod#0256: and i you want run the game with slow speed, you can use `simulation.rate 1` <[newline]> it's very good for debug your build 🙂
circuitgamer77#0377: Got it, thanks :)
Jimmy#8080: use the server command `simulation.step`
circuitgamer77#0377: Is there a way to step the simulation 1 tick at a time?
circuitgamer77#0377: *Here we see the wild Jimmy in his natural habitat...*
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: It's the fabled Jimmy himself, I am in aw :pog:
Jimmy#8080: yes, welcome :D
circuitgamer77#0377: Welcome to the community :)
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I've not seen much, I'm only a day old 🙂
circuitgamer77#0377: Instant Carry Adder
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I don't know what ICA is
circuitgamer77#0377: Have you seen that kind of ICA design?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Thanks
circuitgamer77#0377: That enables fine placing
circuitgamer77#0377: Or whatever your mod key is
circuitgamer77#0377: Hold control
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: How do you center a mount on a circuit board? It keeps snapping to edges for me
circuitgamer77#0377: Maybe an old design did work with 1 tick inputs, but if I made one I can't find it
circuitgamer77#0377: Has anyone made a synced ICA that can take inputs that are 1 tick long?  I've only managed to make ones that require 2 tick inputs.  Originally I thought they could be 1 tick, but I had miscounted the timing.
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Wait, I found them, just..... floating there
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I asked if they were dead and they haven't responded, so, they're it's hard to know their living status.
circuitgamer77#0377: Send a message "who's here" in chat, then when people respond use the confirmation message to get into their computer and figure out who they are - oh wait...
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Oh, nice I thought I had to do a social security lookup, that's way easier
Dragon Lord#6944: Hack into it, sniffing coming and outgoing packets to get IPS of players that are currently online, then hack into their computers and rip the username from ram. /J
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Any way to list players on a server?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: there a master mod list for the game like there is for maps?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: My eye?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think 0 should be a different gate just to keep it balanced, but I do think the delayer should be able to be set to 1, and the normal buffer could be smaller (I'm thinking 1/3 tile wide, because it's a fairly simple component and tends to be used on busses)
nemerod#0256: good idea for my eye 🙂
nemerod#0256: so you see why the delays with setting 0 or 1 or more = shit with the idea by one guy <[newline]>  <[newline]> but for true, the idea it's very good, one component have 3 function depending value you set <[newline]> 0 = no tick, juste simple diode <[newline]> 1 = just one tick for enable or disable <[newline]> 2+ = stable state for same resulte on the output
nemerod#0256: welcome back 🙂
nemerod#0256: you know the redstone in minecraft,
nemerod#0256: if any wire touching with 1 pixel other wire or component, byebye and not allowed
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
nemerod#0256: he no want allowed the wire if touching other wire
nemerod#0256: dont worry, i found 1 other guy no aprecial too many error for wire physic and several thing on the game, you see your big project you made with like ...
nemerod#0256: 0 = fast buffer <[newline]> 1 = basic buffer 1 tick <[newline]> 2 & more = just delayer
Dragon Lord#6944: oof, i forgot to read above... sorry
nemerod#0256: but i ask if he have idea it's good idea for make only 1 component with 3 function inside
nemerod#0256: we know
Dragon Lord#6944: buffer is one tick delay, fast buffer is no delay, delay is 2+ ticks of delay
nemerod#0256: the buffer + fast buffer + delay = same component
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: I get that there's a buffer for 1 tick delays and one for 0, but surly that could be packed into one.
nemerod#0256: 
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Old maps also stay 1 if they were 1 before
nemerod#0256: i know on the map, 1 guy used the delay with value 1
nemerod#0256: you can with mod force other value , like 1
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Is there a technical limitation I'm not seeing?
EmergencyTemporalShift#0001: Why is the delay gate limited to a minimum of two, what if you want to be able to quickly adjust between 0 and thirty?
Ecconia#4929: Once you have that decoder just copy paste it like usual, just like that diagram everyone shows in tutorials
Ecconia#4929: You can simply build a decoder for that. <[newline]> You need to decode the BCD numbers 1 to 9. <[newline]> And the output will the input times 2. <[newline]> Input bits are: 1 2 4 8 <[newline]> Output bits are: 2 4 8 10 <[newline]> So 6 (0110) becomes 12 (1001) <[newline]> 9 (1001) becomes 18 (0011) <[newline]> 4 (0010) becomes 8 (0010)
GUMMYCAT#6001: is there a bcd (if larger than 4 add 3) circuit that isnt a ripple carry adder?  i could do a cla adder but i feel like there is a different circuit you can use to get the right outputs
circuitgamer77#0377: It's in the process of turning complete, it's just not quite there yet...
DanielGJ44#4557: Turning Complete > Turing Complete
Verlio_H#0201: *Turing Complete
AJ213#5731: I am hoping to convert my computer in Turning Complete in this game with friends
AJ213#5731: If you want a good source when you start approaching challenges, Turning Complete is a good game to look at. Its the main reason I got this game actually
Jimmy#8080: Unfortunately Logic World just isn't very beginner friendly at the moment. If you have limited experience with logic, you will have to put in some work to learn. (Or you could wait for updates ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
Jimmy#8080: Not yet <@!469944405177008128> . Coming later in Early Access.
DCVendex#2056: Is there some tutorial or challenges in the game to help learn some circuits?
Purrnicious#8425: i mean i dont really know if im familiar with digital logic, all i did was copy a circuit diagram. point taken though, thanks
borges#7777: show one of those to someone who knows their digital logic yet has never seen a 7seg decoder, and they'll have no idea what it is
borges#7777: low-level, stateless components such as those aren't meant to be understood at an intuitive level -- they're glorified lookup tables
borges#7777: you having built a 7seg decoder means you are familiar with digital logic to _some_ degree
borges#7777: depends on what exactly you want to learn
Purrnicious#8425: Can anyone recommend any resources, youtube or articles etc, that are suited for a newbie?
Purrnicious#8425: I just built a bcd to 7-segment decoder which was fun but I wish I understood the logic at a more intuitive level.
JC Denton#9567: I might just forget about pipelining and hope for the best
Ecconia#4929: But it's the same with Relays vs AND gates, you need to find the perfect balance to get optimal performance. Same with pipelined vs not pipelined. <[newline]> But things become mad if you optimize simulation throughput.
Ecconia#4929: That heavily depends on the computer running the server. <[newline]> And it is nothing you can take objectively. <[newline]> You basically want to optimize your LW-CPU in a way, that LW never waits between ticks, it should always simulate. But optimizing for that is insane, every computer hickup would break it.
JC Denton#9567: But since it updates much more components at the same time the tick rate gets slower, so is it still much better?
Ecconia#4929: No. You can omit it, if you do not like it. <[newline]> When the CPU has to branch and does not know where yet, it can stop feeding instructions to itself, until it knows the branch destination. Should be called "bubble" so you feed a bubble into your CPU until branch result is ready. <[newline]> With register renaming/forwarding, you can also decrease the time to wait, But looks like you want many many stages, that makes it more difficult.
Ecconia#4929: At constant TPS it has a higher throughput (if well built). Just like any other pipelined CPU
JC Denton#9567: Anyway is a pipelined CPU faster in LW or not?
JC Denton#9567: Though once my friend said that branching is really slow, and now I know why
JC Denton#9567: but I don't think I need that as I am just a programmer and you can write assembly language without knowing what the instructions really do to certain extent
JC Denton#9567: It would be a real lesson though
JC Denton#9567: I fear that I am not going to get anything done if I am gonna do pipelining and branch prediction :D
circuitgamer77#0377: And learning :)
circuitgamer77#0377: I just like the fun of solving the puzzles :)
JC Denton#9567: shouldn't be though?
JC Denton#9567: Yeah I thought if it is just as slow or slower
circuitgamer77#0377: I suspect pipelining a CPU in Logic World will always make it run slower at max tickrate due to the added circuitry required.
JC Denton#9567: I just want max speed to run slow programs such as writing the whole 256x256 screen at once
JC Denton#9567: Oh
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm pretty much ignoring sim efficiency and planning for usage with other in-world components, so there's a fair baseline to compare to.
JC Denton#9567: I wish the game would just run 100 million ticks per second so I wouldn't have to plan pipelining 😂
circuitgamer77#0377: Instruction delay says how many ticks it would be after an instruction is executed that that bus would be used
JC Denton#9567: I thought about having copies of RAM where instructions address different RAM copies, reads are from a specific copy and write is to all copies
circuitgamer77#0377: There's a bit of multitasking where there would be no risk of data collision.
circuitgamer77#0377: 
circuitgamer77#0377: Instruction address and data only connect to the program counter and the instruction decode circuit, while the rest connect to most other internal components.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm getting around that with 5 seperate busses that connect to RAM - instruction address, instruction data, general address, general read, and general write.
JC Denton#9567: that is probably a "hazard"
JC Denton#9567: something I am worried about in my code is that there is RAM out and RAM in at the same time etc.
circuitgamer77#0377: I haven't yet, but I should :)
JC Denton#9567: just googled it and I think I understand
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't either, I'm just using the word with my system to describe instructions that temporarily stop the flow of instructions.  It's a little unusual because I'm reading 1 instruction every single tick.
JC Denton#9567: Im not sure what stalling means yet
JC Denton#9567: (Im a dummy)
circuitgamer77#0377: Per instruction, those are the sections I want (divided through 32 bits)
JC Denton#9567: You mean the opcode, register ID, control are a value in a memory
circuitgamer77#0377: ?
JC Denton#9567: You mean having that stuff in a memory address?
circuitgamer77#0377: anyway, I need to go to bed soon.  I'll probably still be talking for a little bit longer, but I don't know yet.
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't have a great idea of the layout yet though.
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm hoping to have an opcode section, 1-3 register ID sections depending on the instruction, and a special control section (for stalling instructions only at the moment)
JC Denton#9567: (or if you don't use the HMM memory mod you could have 20 bits)
JC Denton#9567: Or actually I think you could use the 16 bits for data and 16 bits for the instruction
circuitgamer77#0377: That's the kind of thing I was thinking
JC Denton#9567: I also thought about having just a single register :D
JC Denton#9567: I thought about having like 32 bits in memory where 16 bits are data, 8 bits are for the instruction and 8 bits are for additional stuff in the instruction so you could have "LDI 255" which is load 255 into register A
circuitgamer77#0377: My CPU is very timing sensitive
circuitgamer77#0377: yes, or a way to replace the register ID with a value to use.  Could be a control bit in the instruction, but I don't know how the timing would work with my layout.
JC Denton#9567: like having an instruction that directly puts a value into a register instead of loading it from memory?
circuitgamer77#0377: Except for zero, that will be a register that always has a zero.
circuitgamer77#0377: I might just require any value used to be loaded from memory
circuitgamer77#0377: (by the way, I still don't know how to handle immediates, if I handle them at all.  Any ideas?)
circuitgamer77#0377: Ok
circuitgamer77#0377: When I say instruction I usually mean specific variations, not a category.
JC Denton#9567: anyway in my case you would need just one instruction to save the result of the condition to RAM
circuitgamer77#0377: yes
JC Denton#9567: I guess you mean a single instruction for saving zero flag for example
circuitgamer77#0377: A set as in a set of possible instructions (possibly categorized as "save flag"?) that can be used
JC Denton#9567: a set of instructions, so you would need multiple instructions? Why not use RAM for that?
JC Denton#9567: Maybe that makes sense yes
circuitgamer77#0377: Saving a boolean from a comparison or other flag for later use?
JC Denton#9567: I can't think what you would need that for
circuitgamer77#0377: I might make a set of instructions to save flags directly to a register, but I'm not sure yet.
JC Denton#9567: in case it's used later
JC Denton#9567: Could write the result  of the condition to RAM
circuitgamer77#0377: Could be useful for subroutines?  You could use those instructions to save register values to memory.
JC Denton#9567: but it should be under 5 instructions
JC Denton#9567: could do something that happens later in the code that does not need the previous code
circuitgamer77#0377: Still a little confusing though.
circuitgamer77#0377: You might be able to use those spaces for other instructions though, depending on your program.
JC Denton#9567: it would look horrible if you always had to insert 4 NOPs
GHXX#9078: there was a push for a unified compiler and c#-like lang at some point fyi
JC Denton#9567: forgot the NOP after the second JMP too
JC Denton#9567: so in code you would just write that C code instead of having <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> LDA 15 <[newline]> SUB 16 <[newline]> JZ 12 <[newline]> NOP <[newline]> NOP <[newline]> NOP <[newline]> NOP <[newline]> LDA 15 <[newline]> ADD 16 <[newline]> STA 17 <[newline]> JMP 17 <[newline]> LDA 15 <[newline]> SUB 16 <[newline]> STA 17 <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> (this code does not work because of addresses lol)
circuitgamer77#0377: I think a C-like language would be easiest to compile - it breaks down pretty directly into assembly.
circuitgamer77#0377: :)
JC Denton#9567: Of course lol that is what I meant :D
circuitgamer77#0377: Wouldn't that be the compiler, not the language?
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't have the best understanding of real-world processors, although I know a bit.
JC Denton#9567: I thought about making a programming language that inserts all the NOPs automatically
JC Denton#9567: That is an option as well
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm designing in both for mine - I think the main reason is that requiring NOPs might be less clear for programming.  I'm making mine have an optional pause on any instruction, and that pause removes the need for branch prediction on most jumps.
JC Denton#9567: Or am I getting it all wrong?
JC Denton#9567: Just have NOP instructions after jumps, this is still faster than executing instructions sequentially (30 steps)
JC Denton#9567: Equilevant to this
JC Denton#9567: Take this for example (Code decoded into micro-instructions)
JC Denton#9567: Do you really need branch prediction for a pipelined CPU?
!Chips#4890: ohh ok
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: gotchya, the short story is its basically a way to do demorgans theorem. the output logic is either OR based or AND based
!Chips#4890: I will in an hour or a bit haha, thank you for your help again. going to watch videos on SOP and POS
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i think you get the idea here <a:KEKWgif:829851650717909094> <@!195392430416199680>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: column h
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for column G
PseudoGoose#2841: right
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: lmao its basicallly another half adder
PseudoGoose#2841: ok
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah i gues <a:top_kek:699701562037239859>
PseudoGoose#2841: I guess the extra logic based on the MSBs is basically that extra bit
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ?
PseudoGoose#2841: OH
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah I just came up with that, which is a bit more elegant if you can do that
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thats what I did in my bresenham
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <a:bigHead:806493553723179018>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: nah it doesnt need that if you just make it 1 bit wider than you need for inputs
PseudoGoose#2841: but actually, my point wasn't even about architecture/flags/etc. It was just about implementing a signed comparator in hardware. If you need to build hardware to do signed-less-than, it needs to handle overflow, which can be done with a bit of extra logic (either 1. make the subtractor N+1 bits and sign-extend the inputs, OR 2. add some extra logic to detect overflow from input and output signs, and XOR that overflow check with the output sign)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this online tool can convert to either SOP or POS form http://www.32x8.com/var4.html
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: looks like you wanted reduced to POS terms for and gates right?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: A&B&C == !(!A|!B|!C)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yea <[newline]> https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/933122704125599804
!Chips#4890: minecraft?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you can do it how you would in MC
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: gotchya
PseudoGoose#2841: right
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: which is why a subroutine can be called to handle that exception and record it/log it to the os. or like you said, can have a dedicated flag for it.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ah okay yea so you need to xor it
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but OF doesnt show the sign result
!Chips#4890: Does anyone know how to compact this? I saw a while ago someone made a decoder with inverters where the and gates are.
PseudoGoose#2841: e.g. AVR has a V flag for signed overflow, a S flag for sign (MSB), and N flag (overflow-compensated sign, for signed comparisons, which is S XOR V)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you can choose to ignore OF exceptions
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in any cpu worth its salt, thats how it works
PseudoGoose#2841: _some_ CPUs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in CPUs it throws an error/exception, and a subroutine is called to handle that specific exception
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: eitherway, the overflow flag doesnt tell you signage, just that you cannot trust the sign result and must evaluate the inputs which caused the OF
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ah okay fair
PseudoGoose#2841: the hardware/operations is very commonly called "integer arithmetic" even if you use it for fixed-point
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm, but theyre not integers, so i was just trying to minimize confusion
PseudoGoose#2841: that's not relevant to my point
PseudoGoose#2841: obviously, add/sub on integers is the same as fixed point
PseudoGoose#2841: yes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so comparisons can be done on any fixed point value
PseudoGoose#2841: yes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in 8.0 format
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: integer is fixed point
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: nope
PseudoGoose#2841: i just mean integer processors (I thought the broader context that I missed might have been FP)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it doesnt apply to only integers :)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: im talking any fixed point binary number...
PseudoGoose#2841: are we talking about integers?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it doesnt tell you a<b or a>b
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it has no meaningful data
PseudoGoose#2841: you can also infer that the sign flipped by going too far in one direction
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then an exception handeler gets invoked by the CPU
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it just tells you it overlfowed and no comparison can be made
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: right, but it does not compute comparison
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then theres usually a mask to enable or disable overflow exceptions
PseudoGoose#2841: signed overflow flag/predicate tells you if the adder wrapped from negative to positive or the other direction.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: re: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.overflowexception?view=net-6.0
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and then exception handling is done similar to an ISR
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: overlfow is usally thrown as an exception by the CPU core
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this isnt true. its just the msb and if0 flags. overflow doesnt tell you signage, ity just tells you that the values are wrong to be able to compute a sign because it overflowed
PseudoGoose#2841: If your comparator overflows (can happen when doing negative minus positive  or positive minus negative), then the sign won't be the correct value. So the signed less-than test is actually (sign bit XOR signed overflow)
circuitgamer77#0377: Got it, thank you :)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: signed 5 >-3
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: unsigned -3 > 5
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: enter 5 and negative 3
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it doesnt compute the signed comparison
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if not 0 and msb = 0 then positive
circuitgamer77#0377: Is there any reason not to use the carryout for signed as well?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if 0 and msb = 0 then a = b
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so you need 2 flags, if 0 , and msb
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yup
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm doing comparison by subtraction, and if the result is negative than A < B, if positive then A > B, and if zero A = B.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so for any comparison, you use the carryout for unsigned, and the msb for signed
circuitgamer77#0377: I know
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if msb = 1 then negative
circuitgamer77#0377: I know
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the sign is the msb
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm
circuitgamer77#0377: (or would both use the carry out, and the subtraction method means both is identical?)
circuitgamer77#0377: For signed vs unsigned comparisons (by subtraction), is the only difference using the 32nd bit vs the carry out?
Ecconia#4929: Hold `Control` (the mod key) for fine placement and fine rotation.
Wessel#9460: how do i place those small sockets beside eachother
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes, use fast buffers and normal buffers in parallel, and if the starting signal is longer, you can use delayers in place of the normal buffers to set to the length of the input signal.
GUMMYCAT#6001: is there a way to extend a pulse into any length?
GHXX#9078: reading isnt implemented yet, but writing is and it works (the circuit in the bottom right corner writes value X onto address X, so address 0 has value 0, 1 has 1, etc.)
GHXX#9078: so the memory position is picked by just waiting the exact amount of time and then yeeting in the correct new value, or snagging the value if you want to read
GHXX#9078: the key ingredient is the timing logic which is quite nice as it converts a binary input into a delay
GHXX#9078: this could also be 64 128 or any 2^n power
GHXX#9078: so 32 ticks for a single rotation
GHXX#9078: speed is 1 tick per cell
GHXX#9078: it cycles once when data is requested
circuitgamer77#0377: Does it only cycle when data is requested, or does it still rotate constantly?
GHXX#9078: which can be copied to a full 256 bytes, without having to re-make the left logic part, but its still WIP
GHXX#9078: thats 32 bytes
GHXX#9078: sortof like the delay line, but it doesnt flicker 24/7
circuitgamer77#0377: Has anyone made a more compact solution to large data storage than delay line memory?
GHXX#9078: minimum delay is 2 😛
JC Denton#9567: Also it's easier to place a 1 tick delay buffer than place a delay which you have to set to 1 tick with X
GHXX#9078: if you feed pulses to the delayer that are shorter than the delay time, the output will never be set, which might not be what you want
GHXX#9078: there is also an advantage of using N buffers instead of a delayer that has a N tick delay
GHXX#9078: buffers have 1 tick delay
GHXX#9078: fast buffers dont have a delay
JC Denton#9567: They are instant but prevent backwards signal, no delay in them
Zpruce#5070: What is the advantage of buffers over delays? Why wouldn't you just use delays?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's an example of a 7 stage pipelined cpu.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Looks kind of like it. But I think your doing more of a micro instruction set here.
JC Denton#9567: Obviously not that effective
JC Denton#9567: CO = counter out MI = MAR in, RO=RAM out, II = Instruction register in, CE = counter enable, IO = instruction out
JC Denton#9567: I couldn't understand how to have counter out happening same time as counter enable or counter out memory address in happening the same time as instruction register out memory address in, I guess CO MI RO II CE IO MI is the fetch?
JC Denton#9567: Is this something like instruction pipelining? Using Ben Eater microcode names
JC Denton#9567: 
Luckybuilder#6131: thanks that makes what im doing so much easier
circuitgamer77#0377: scroll wheel while multiselected
Luckybuilder#6131: can i multi select 2 pegs without selecting the pegs between them?
CrispyPin#1149: grab with g
CrispyPin#1149: grab the root board then delete it
Beyefendi Yiğit#7087: is there a way to delete an entire circuit or do i have to delete everything one by one
nemerod#0256: so, read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predication_(computer_architecture)
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't really want to make it stall perfectly, just enough to avoid no op instructions between other instructions being required.
nemerod#0256: and for more detail read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_stall
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you need interlocking registers to hold the state in between clock cycles if you want to stall
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it flushes the whole pipeline
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in a waterfall pipeline you cannot stall
nemerod#0256: -.-, read and check what we mean
circuitgamer77#0377: It is pipelined, just a different method.
nemerod#0256: good luck
nemerod#0256: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining
nemerod#0256: search the advantage for pipeline
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know how big the pipeline actually is because it's relying on tick delay to act as if it's pipelined.
circuitgamer77#0377: But that means that the data it receives may or may not be valid after the stalling instruction.
circuitgamer77#0377: The challenge I'm running into is that after the processor stops requesting data from RAM (which is more like a cache - it's fastest possible) it still receives several instructions that had been requested previously.  It takes 2 ticks for the RAM to return data, but it's synced so I can get 1 instruction per tick.
nemerod#0256: pipeline deep size ?
circuitgamer77#0377: yes
nemerod#0256: with pipeline ?
circuitgamer77#0377: The actual system I'm designing is a system where there's one bit in every instruction that tells the processor to stall until the instruction is complete.  It would allow a bit more flexibility for the programmer without the processor needing to figure out where instructions collide.  It also means that the programmer could write a program where the processor can use an old value in memory just before a write instruction overwrites it.
nemerod#0256: and create new design of CPU with the best perfomance and pipeline and speed and dual branch logic
nemerod#0256: call the creator of processor, like intel, amd, arm, and remake all CPU on the world for 7 000 000 000 people
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Also, I think if a second branch is hit while in a prediction, it stalls.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Well in addition to that, Either the changes to the registers are buffered until the branch prediction is confirmed, or a copy is made for returning them.
circuitgamer77#0377: I kind of understand, but not completely.  (also, the reason I'm asking is actually for a system that is very similar to what would happen on a branch prediction fail, but not quite the same, and I think this is where the systems would differ)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ^
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: For branch prediction. You should have a table of branches, each with the address the branch originated, and the address the branch goes to. The origin address is like a tag in a cache.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: store the branch address. as it can take several cycles to flush
circuitgamer77#0377: So just have a set of registers that store the previous states of the PC?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you need a record of the branch addresses
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you jump to the branch address it was originally uspposed to take
circuitgamer77#0377: And it could have been set to something from the instructions before the current branch, so it couldn't just be a decrement.
circuitgamer77#0377: Just remembered the part I was actually stuck on - how would the program counter be reset to the state it was in before the flush?  It would have counted several more times in the time it takes the branch instruction to actually be decoded.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Just remember, the deeper the pipeline, the longer it takes to flush after a mispredict
circuitgamer77#0377: Wait - I forgot about something.  I think I understand :)
circuitgamer77#0377: I understand that part, but not how any writes to memory or registers get undone.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: flush the pipeline and redo the branch
circuitgamer77#0377: Can anyone explain how a pipelined CPU recovers after an incorrect branch prediction?  I understand how the branch prediction works, but not how the CPU recovers afterwards.
GHXX#9078: even if the component file format changes, thats no issue, the mod simply needs to be updated and its all good to go again
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah afaik, if the mods are simple component style things and not game mechanics and such, as long as the way the game reads game data doesnt change, the component mods i use should be safe haha
GHXX#9078: but from experience i'd suspect that it will be decently rare that a LW update breaks a modded save to the point where there is no way to fix it on the modder's side
GHXX#9078: of course, since you dont support them officially
GHXX#9078: i mean, of course it is not certain that that wont happen
GHXX#9078: yeah but likely not to the point where saves get corrupted
Jimmy#8080: LW updates will definitely 100% for sure break mods, until mods are officially supported (which, I cannot stress enough, they currently are not!)
JC Denton#9567: <#910673109164638239>
GHXX#9078: lw updates shouldnt break mods, unless if jimmy decides to change the way mods work of course (on a veeery low level), but i think thats unlikely
JC Denton#9567: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/910673109164638239
Wessel#9460: where's the mods section?
GHXX#9078: yes
JC Denton#9567: You mean if the mod changes? I mean if LW updates break the mods
GHXX#9078: they can, if the input or output count of a modded gate thats placed changes
GHXX#9078: ah yeah the classic copy paste issue
JC Denton#9567: 😅  let's hope that
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: otherwise im so screwed man
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: im relying on the mods not breaking
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i hope not
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: idk
JC Denton#9567: Do they?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 🤞
JC Denton#9567: I don't see a reason why not to - unless if LW updates break mods and thus corrupt your save files
JC Denton#9567: yes obviously
JC Denton#9567: probably when you've got 900 000 gates it would take much longer than 20s
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i def reccomend memory and screen mods if youre trying to make anything more advanced
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah when you have a large net that happens
JC Denton#9567: Maybe that is a bug that can be fixed or has been fixed but I guess it happens when you have tons of objects connected together
JC Denton#9567: it wouldn't let me place objects etc. but I could run around
JC Denton#9567: whenever I inserted a memory cell it would take like 20s until I could interact with the game again
JC Denton#9567: the game
GHXX#9078: your logic or the game
GHXX#9078: what started to glitch?
JC Denton#9567: I once did something like 512 bytes of memory and it started to glitch when I added more memory cells
JC Denton#9567: I wonder how much space would that take and how much would you torture yourself with the glitches that happen while building it
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: schduling. mutex, resource allocations. all of that is os specific
GHXX#9078: but much more compact
GHXX#9078: this storage can be used as memory, but is slower than ram of course
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hardware is memory mapped, it all comes down to memory
GHXX#9078: but the base 1 stays
GHXX#9078: .1 being an overhead which can be increased for more speed, or decreased to a minimum of about 0 for slower speed
GHXX#9078: 1MB of storage would be implementable using about 1.1*8 million gates or so
JC Denton#9567: I've heard someone say you could have a 300-600KB linux kernel
binaryclock03#5762: seems to do more then just memory, seems to do all hardware as well as run common things
binaryclock03#5762: ye
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it manages all the memory between programs so you can have several things running at once
binaryclock03#5762: I just had to ask myself what an OS actually is lol, I dont exactly see why I'd want one in lw but it would be a cool challenge
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you can strip down a unix os to probably about 1MB
binaryclock03#5762: I see
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its based on the unix system
binaryclock03#5762: true
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_RISC/os
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: check out RISC/os
Reese4221#8317: its significantly more practical
binaryclock03#5762: yeah but thats not really as fun
Reese4221#8317: you could make something custom
binaryclock03#5762: damn if it was a couple hundred KB I think it'd be possible
Reese4221#8317: megabytes at least
binaryclock03#5762: how much would you need?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: my intelligem cpu arch can run linux assuming you transpile the mips32 c++ output to intelligem
JC Denton#9567: Linux would require a 32-bit CPU but I guess it's doable in LW, just really laboursome
JC Denton#9567: I think just 1KB of RAM makes the game go 0.01FPS when you move it
JC Denton#9567: Was planning to use 64k RAM mod
JC Denton#9567: Obviously you can't make 1MB of RAM with latches
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: There are instructions that the OS uses and doesn't let user programs use. Those instructions are like IO and memory based. All the management things so that user programs don't overwrite the system or cause crashes so easily.
Stefan#5422: ^
CrispyPin#1149: without modding it's currently not possible to have enough memory to use even the most stripped down linux install
Stefan#5422: If you meant what instructions you need: It just needs turing completeness. <[newline]>  <[newline]> otherwise <[newline]>  <[newline]> Short answer: The CPU does not really run an OS the computer does because you need ram etc. <[newline]> A bit more detailed answer: Depends: <[newline]> a) you want a preexisting OS to run on your pc more specifically windows <[newline]> A: fuck no <[newline]> b) you want to run linux <[newline]> A: Write a asm compiler which compiles to machine code.

TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: my goto reccomendation is mips32 for learning about irl RISC cpus, and then when you get the basics you can attempt to learn RISCV as it is very similar but much newer
JC Denton#9567: What matters really is that I might wanna do more and don't know how
JC Denton#9567: Not really simpler but simple
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: there are lots of better archs but they probably wont be simpler
JC Denton#9567: Where could I find good CPU designs with easy to understand material? I have watched Ben Eater and learned most from that, but I guess there are lots of better simple architectures
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yea. If he has to, to fix floating point issue. Which I have a feeling he will have to.

Pinpoint Townes#4560: turs out i can type there is just no indication until a character is entered
Jimmy#8080: as a workaround, you can use the console command `connect [ip address]` to connect to a server
Jimmy#8080: I have no idea why you would be able to use one text box but not the others
Jimmy#8080: that's bizarre
Jimmy#8080: what
Pinpoint Townes#4560: whenever i press tab or try to select the text box it doesnt show the typing cursor
Jimmy#8080: Yes it does <@!150174912982548480> . The UI is not capable of greying out text boxes, I haven't ever needed that feature so I haven't added it. Can you send a screenshot of your issue?
Pinpoint Townes#4560: asking because the ip and password boxes are greyed-out
Pinpoint Townes#4560: does multiplayer work on linux version?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Emptying the pipeline. The longer the pipe, the longer you have to wait for it to empty the wrong data on a branch mispredict for example.
JC Denton#9567: What are flushing and stalls?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: I think whoever's working on it here won't get to far. That's a deep pipeline and it comes with a lot of challenges such as flushing and stalls.
JC Denton#9567: Is somebody currently attempting to make one?
JC Denton#9567: I wonder when will we see somebody make an OS and programs run in LW
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: np
JC Denton#9567: Cool, thanks for the information
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: For a text editor, sure. I think it'll be more the screen design that allows for it to be in real time.
JC Denton#9567: Or do I need to learn making a better CPU right away
JC Denton#9567: But should I make a 12-15 ticks per instruction CPU and expect it to run a text editor?
JC Denton#9567: Of course not 😂
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yea, the number of updates per second would be the limiting factor. But the simulation is pretty darn good, so a realtime text prompt with text editing should be possible. Realtime video playback of 1080p at 60 fps on the other hand. Not likely without mods.
JC Denton#9567: I guess drawing on a screen requires few gate updates
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: My pipelined PC is gonna have a lower max tps because of the pipelining. But it will have a lower ticks per cycle. Ultimately, tps alone doesn't accurately describe the limit of what can be done in real time, because you can have tons of things happening simultaneously.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: What is currently happening. The more gates being changed the lower the tps. Of course the better your PC the more tps.
JC Denton#9567: Does the TPS depend on all the things you have in the world or just what is currently happening?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: My first build was 12 ticks, no pipelining or anything. The one I'm working on now is pipelined to make it 6 ticks.
JC Denton#9567: but maybe 5-10 ticks isn't that bad
JC Denton#9567: I am sure I will never be smart enough to do 1 tick per instruction
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: In the creation hub, on the Logic World website, there's an example of a text prompt screen that could easily work in real time at relatively low tps. FML-8 8-bit CPU. A new line command shifts the entire screen upwards like a shift register.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Should be able to. One person here is working on making something that runs 1 instructions per tick. My newest build does 6 tick cycles.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Depends on the build. I've done 1 million tps with only a bcd decoder running. But a floating point adder could only run at around 20 thousand tps.
JC Denton#9567: So what is the fastest TPS achievable in LW?
JC Denton#9567: with 10000 per second it is 4 seconds of course
JC Denton#9567: If I calculated correctly 5 tick instructions and instant character drawing would result in 49 second screen refresh with 1000 ticks per second
JC Denton#9567: I could be wrong though, maybe decent speed is achievable
JC Denton#9567: What is the fastest simulation speed logic world can achieve?
JC Denton#9567: Something I thought of would be having a really fast way to draw character possibly pixels in parallel, so it would draw 10-20 pixels at once or such
JC Denton#9567: Would require every component to be 1 tick speed
JC Denton#9567: Do you think you could have an instruction as fast as 5 ticks?
JC Denton#9567: 3 million ticks per second would be enough to update the 256x256 in a second
Sekoia#3968: Then, yeah, you have to redraw everything
Sekoia#3968: Also 10-20 tick instructions is quite slow
JC Denton#9567: or just type a new line in a shell
JC Denton#9567: But what if you scroll in a text editor? Every character moves up?
Sekoia#3968: Generally you only draw what changes
Sekoia#3968: That's full screen drawing
JC Denton#9567: Even a 64x64 screen would require 4 minutes to update
JC Denton#9567: Let's say an instruction has 5 phases. Each increments with a clock tick. A clock might be 2-4 ticks so it is 10-20 per instruction. Drawing a pixel would probably require reading x,y,color from a register, so it would be 3 instructions. With 20 ticks per instruction, it is 60 ticks to draw a pixel. So filling a 256x256 screen with pixels is 3 932 160 ticks long. 1000 ticks per second would mean 3932 seconds thus a hour for drawing the screen! And you probably need to draw the whole screen to scroll in a text editor.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Yea that's when the fun begins :))
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yea, with my goal of a cpu cycle of 4-8 ticks, I'm gonna go with 2 cycle unaligned reads. A more modern issue seems to be cache related. Like reading a word crossing a cache line boundry. Worst case, 2 cache lines are flushed, and 2 more read in, because of 2 misses on a single word.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ah, yeah it sounded more like an architecture specific problem
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: After some digging, it seems to be an issue of critical path length. For aligned access, only one address is needed. But, for unaligned, a second address must be calculated with an adder. That adder causes the critical path to be too long, and so rather than putting the adder in the memory, a second address is calculated and sent from the cpu to read the unaligned word in 2 cycles.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I'm more asking about currently existing designs than how to make my own. I've seen many references to unaligned memory reads using 2 cycles. But, none of them have gone into the details of how it's implemented. I can make my own 1 cycle byte addressable 32 bit memory much like I could make dual port memory and such. I'm just curious about existing designs that take 2 cycles for unaligned memory reads and was wandering if anyone here might have the details.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I'm at work right now, I can talk more succinctly after I return home in about an hour.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i still see no reason for it to be 2 cycle as i have it in 1 cycle
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: because you can send a word address in, and just cut out parts of that data word after then reshift
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: are you talking on the data or address?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thats not what were tralking about dude lol(i think yore talklking about like x y decoders for ram addr)
nemerod#0256: if i can , you can use 4 memory in //, and with 2 bit from address you can select who memory the first
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: If a ram is addressed by word. You could make a translation interface that shifts a byte address 2 bits for the word and use the 2 shifted out bits to select bytes from it. The literature I've read have all said that unaligned words take 2 cycles, so I assumed that this is how it works.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i just want to clarify that this can be done in a single cycle
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in modern cpus its all byte addressed but word sizes can be larger
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if its byte addressed, you can do both word and byte read/writes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if its word addressed, you cannot interace with byte addressing methods
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: im not sure what you mean how to interace with byte addressing
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Further, if this is or is not how its typically done in real world desktop pcs would be nice.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <@!118121598388666375> i apologize
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Sorry for confusion. I am asking about a memory module based on 32 bit word size, with word addressing. How to interface with byte addressing.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yea!
PseudoGoose#2841: since it's still 1 read for each byte-wise bank, just rotated
PseudoGoose#2841: but anyway, to implement unaligned word accesses with byte addressable, you would increment the address for the first (address % 4) modules and then rotate the data by (address % 4) bytes?
nemerod#0256: sorry, *girl
Stenodyon#8192: girl*
nemerod#0256: thank but i know the guy now, too late, but thank anyway 🙂
PseudoGoose#2841: I believe you are looking for <@!138380569573720065>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah okay so heres an way way to settle this, wait for vinyl to confirm
PseudoGoose#2841: but that's just part of the question
PseudoGoose#2841: and also unaligned reads and writes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: he already has ALIGNED READ AND WRITE
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so he has a byte addressable ram that hes trying to add UNALIGNED READS AND WRITES TO
PseudoGoose#2841: Like I just said, "add logic to a (black box) word addressed 32 bit module to also perform 1/2 byte reads/writes "
PseudoGoose#2841: EXACTLY
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: jesus
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: not 1 word of 32 bits
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: he literally says writing 1 byte
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: dude
PseudoGoose#2841: > But for writing, say 1 byte, would you read a word, mask it, or in the byte then write it back? <[newline]> that sounds like reading a 32 bit word and doing some logic to it before writing back
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <@!377717131556552708> correct?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: nah it sounds like hes trying to implement unaligned reads/writes on a byte addressable ram
PseudoGoose#2841: To me it reads like they are trying to add logic to a (black box) word addressed 32 bit module to also perform 1/2 byte reads/writes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: idk why this is so confusing
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: which would be word addressed
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: not fixed 4 byte reads/writes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it says it right there
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 1,2 or 4 byte read/writes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the 32bit data, that is byte addressable
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: read on
PseudoGoose#2841: OP says "32 bit memory module"
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: he has 1byte, 2 byte, or 4byte reads, aka its byte addressable to form bytes, halfs and words
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: that is what we are talking about
PseudoGoose#2841: But that's for _byte_ addressable
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
PseudoGoose#2841: And I figured it out myself anyway
PseudoGoose#2841: I don't see a schem
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: download digital and try out the byte addr ram unit
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and i told you how to verify for youself
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i posted the schem of the logic my dude
PseudoGoose#2841: Okay, sure, I can create a simulated part that magically can do unaligned loads in one cycle. But how do you do it?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it can be done in 1
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: there is no reason for it to have to be 2 cycles
PseudoGoose#2841: ?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in a single cycle
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i can load a word from any address
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: pull up the simulator digital, and try out the byte addressable ram unit
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this isnt true
nemerod#0256: question, who know the guy created the map named `FML-8` ? <[newline]> i want talk with him if possible 🙂
PseudoGoose#2841: You could do it that way. I think it would be easier to have 4x 8-bit memory modules that use the same address lines but separate write-enable lines.
PseudoGoose#2841: if the input address is a byte address and is unaligned, you have to read/write to 2 different 32-bit memory addresses to get the whole word
PseudoGoose#2841: because it is 32-bit addressable
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: wwhy 2 cycles?
Sekoia#3968: since you can change the TPS technically with a good enough computer nothing will lag
Sekoia#3968: but a simple CLI shouldn't be impossible, you'd just need to design it in a smart way
Sekoia#3968: dunno, I'm not that great at the game
JC Denton#9567: So you mean with a really good designed CPU it won't lag too much, meaning you can type in a text editor in it without waiting forever for text to appear? 😃
Sekoia#3968: because yes, absolutely, you could make a computer that swaps between programs on the fly, maybe even with a basic operating system
Sekoia#3968: and also, what you count as "run"
Sekoia#3968: but also depends on your definition of an operating system
Sekoia#3968: depends how fast your computer is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
JC Denton#9567: Is Logic World fast enough to run an operating system and a few programs at the same time?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Or would the memory have separate clocks for each byte of the addressed word?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: For a 32 bit memory module. With 1, 2, or 4 byte reads and writes. I gather that unaligned reads and writes take 2 cycles. And reads can be done with shifts and masks. But for writing, say 1 byte, would you read a word, mask it, or in the byte then write it back?
Limón#7879: this is a questions channel for the game maybe ask in <#416276124977332226>
Agent Cookie#3932: Hello guys. I have some basic tasks in NASM/GAS to do. Could someone help me?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: It auto-throttles down by skipping ticks.
JC Denton#9567: i.e I make a badly designed processor and want it to run fast
JC Denton#9567: At some point I might want to have it at max speed but does that introduce some problems?
circuitgamer77#0377: It's a good balance between speed and being able to see what's happening.
circuitgamer77#0377: You can change it if you want
JC Denton#9567: Why not have simulation rate higher than 30?
MS#5409: ah
Ecconia#4929: I pretty much doubt that, given how much it breaks the further you get away from origin.
MS#5409: does this game use floating origin?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
JC Denton#9567: thanks
JC Denton#9567: oh
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its the one on the edge
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i think you have the clock pin wrong
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: color = red
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: okay so x= y = 0
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: or you can make a counter and hook it up to the x,y address and hook up the clock to the screen and try to draw a straight line
JC Denton#9567: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: make sure you have color data
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: check the bottom left corner
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then press the clock
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: set x = y = 0
JC Denton#9567: tried all kinds of x y values but couldn't see one
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you need to increment the address at which the next byte is stored
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm you have to be
GHXX#9078: maybe im talking about different things tho
GHXX#9078: you can 'or' it together
GHXX#9078: not necessarily
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm pretty confident, but we'll see :)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm <:Doubt:585743260664987649> lol
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm pretty sure I have a workable design that doesn't require that adder.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the address calc requires an adder
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it literally cant be the same speed
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but like
circuitgamer77#0377: JAFBARAM?
circuitgamer77#0377: Acronym for what I'll try to do: JAFBAR (Just-As-Fast Byte-Addressable-RAM).  Nested acronym!
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the pixels are tiny so seeing 1 is hard
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: odds are it did work, but the pixel is in the bottom left corner
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: clock+flood fill will do the fill
JC Denton#9567: I can't get the HMM screen to work. I've got color set to red and im ticking the clock but nothing appears on screen. Only floodfill works.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: heres the default one built into digital which doesnt force alignement(unlike the one i was making in that stream)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if you load 16bits, you load 2 bytes in parallel, each from different banks
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so if you store 16bits, you store 2 bytes, each going to a different bank
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: see the byte rams, there are 4 in parallel
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in byte addresed ram their accessed in paraallel
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if you store 8 bits per address, but can store say 16 or 32 bits at a time then its bbyte addressed
Verlio_H#0201: I mean what if you just accessed 2 bytes one after another and arranged them into 1 16 bit word so externally it functions the same but internally only stores 8 bits per address
GHXX#9078: there
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if youre storing 8 bits per address, and you only can store 8 bits at a time, its word addressed because your data width = word with = 8 bits
GHXX#9078: you are literally accessing single bytes tho
GHXX#9078: what
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this is word addressed, it doesnt become byte addressed till the native data that it can store exceeds 8 bits
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: okay, if you need to check it against a known working one you can download digital and use the byte addressed ram there
circuitgamer77#0377: Must leave for now, but I'll be back later.
GHXX#9078: e.g. if a modded component literally has pins for an address, 8 data pins, a rw-mode-bit and a clock signal
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll try to make a just-as-fast byte-addressable RAM later.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: otherwise its word addresses where each word = byte
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: byte addressable ram only really makes sense on arch larger than 8bit data sizes
circuitgamer77#0377: was responding to other statement
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then thats word addressed because the word and the byte size are the same
GHXX#9078: since thats the simplest form
GHXX#9078: the ram might be 8bit tho
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: lb/lbu/lh/lhu/lw sb/sh/sw
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: by definition if the ram is 32 bits and byte addressable is should have all addressing modes available to it
circuitgamer77#0377: Not necessarily...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you should
GHXX#9078: the only bad thing about just byte addressable ram is that you may not be able to load/write 32bit at once (but thats up to the ram design)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you need incrementers to add 1 to the addresses of each individual 8bit ram
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for a cpu that only operates on bytes tho, there is no difference to them if its byte or word addressed as its the same thing
circuitgamer77#0377: I think you could do the logic as fast as non byte-addressed memory with relays, with some interesting organization...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: sorryy i mis read this
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for things other than bytes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but to form a useful system you need logic for the read and write addressing
GHXX#9078: exactly
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: each address holds 1 byte
GHXX#9078: YES
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thats what btyte addressable memory is
GHXX#9078: fucks sake
GHXX#9078: lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: he is 100% right
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: wait omg i read that werong
GHXX#9078: oh i am
circuitgamer77#0377: I think he's right on this statement
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: my cpu arch defines that you need to be aligned, but other cpus arch can be done howveer they want
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the ram(from the mod) doesnt force alignment
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: anyway, when you do some research and starrt making cpus with bit sizes larger than 8 bits youlll recognize the flaws in your arguments
GHXX#9078: when you align addresses you waste space. period
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and mips32
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and riscV
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: go tell that to arm
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: youre wrong
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: lh - load half, sign extends a 16 bit value to 32 bits
GHXX#9078: and it actually is more efficient to store individual 4 bytes instead of one int (32bit), in case you want to store something smaller
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: lbu - load byte unsigned, doesnt sign extend
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: like load byte signed which is msb = 1 then gets sign extended to 32 bits
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: with all signing options
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and store in bytes/halfs/words
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yes but you can read out in bytes/halfs or words
GHXX#9078: like literally all byte addressable ram is is an array of byte that you can write to at a specific location
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: heres a better one
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://youtu.be/VwPaR6AoPXs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: using 2, 8 bit memorys to make a shitty byte addressed 16bit memory
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: here it is in hw
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://youtu.be/yMGPG2wCWL4
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you need to sum up the addresses for all the bytes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yes ofc
circuitgamer77#0377: Just curious, is the control/addressing logic any slower than just 32 bit addressing?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: holy shit dude
GHXX#9078: why would you store a byte in a 32bit space
GHXX#9078: wtf
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: byte addressable memory is how all modern CPUs operate for this very reason
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: also if the input takes bytes now, youre storing 1 byte per 32bit address which is wasting 3/4s the memory space you have
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if I have a keyboard attached to my cpu, and the cahrs are 16bits, why would i store 1, 16bit char, in a 32bit memory location. when i can store it in 2 bytres of data and not lose storage space
GHXX#9078: apparently so
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: youre completely missing the point
GHXX#9078: instead of using 100 32-bit blocks just use 400 bytes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you make an assumption that is wicked wrong. take the time to google your statements
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i can store 4x more 8bit ascii values
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: than 32bit values
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i can store 2x as many utf-16 chars
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: actually quite the opposite
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its both word and byte addressed which is why its confusing to make that statement
GHXX#9078: if you have 32 bit cells and address individual bytes, this seems inefficient
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: what matters is the mod is designed for 32bit words that are byte addressable
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the semantics of word and what not do not matter
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: okay this is distracting from the main arguemnt holy crap
circuitgamer77#0377: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)
Verlio_H#0201: the size of a word depends on the arch, on a 16 bit cpu it would be 16 bits (like the original 8086), on a 32 bit cpu it would be 32, on a 64 bit cpu it would be 64, etc.
GHXX#9078: but yeah this statement is correct
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the special features are the addressing modes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: id reccomend googling byte addressable ram
GHXX#9078: are there any special features?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so to load a word takes a 4byte aligned address
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yip
GHXX#9078: is it one byte per address?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its assuming LE 32bit words
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: because it only goes up to 32bits per word
GHXX#9078: why would that matter
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the byte addressable memory mod i have assumes its use in mips32/riscV -32
GHXX#9078: eww
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 32 bits is defined as a word
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: okay, in MIPS 32
GHXX#9078: not a word
GHXX#9078: 32 bit is a dword
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: or unsigned
circuitgamer77#0377: A word is whatever the standard for your circuit is, so 32 bits could be a word...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: load half signed
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: load half has 2 options
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 32bits = word, 16 bits = half, 8 bits = byte
GHXX#9078: load half?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yup therefore a load half would require 2 addresses
GHXX#9078: not word addressable
GHXX#9078: a word is 2 bytes, so if each address holds 1 byte, its byte addressable

TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: check this out if you wanna know how to make byte addressable ram from several 8bit rams
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_addressing#:~:text=Byte%20addressable%20memory%20refers%20to,is%20regarded%20as%20word%2Daddressable.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: by default, rams are word addressed. i needed byte addressing for my cpu
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if each address only holds 8 bits, then its word addresses, as your word = byte. so you can also call it byte addressed but that confuses it when you go up to larger bit sizes <[newline]>  <[newline]> if each address holds 16bits, then byte addressable memory means you can load a byte(8bits) or a full word(16bits) <[newline]>  <[newline]> to expand on this even further, if each address holds 32 bits, then byte addressable memory means you can load bytes, halfs, and words
JC Denton#9567: Im just too noob to understand
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no lol
JC Denton#9567: oh
GHXX#9078: hop into a chair
JC Denton#9567: Can you disable controls so that you can press the key blocks without doing stuff in game such as moving?
JC Denton#9567: maybe it's just going over my head but isn't "A simple 8 bit memory component that resembles a D-Latch. Has a 16 bit address for a total of 65,536 bytes." byte addressable?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: oh theres also dual read regs in that mod
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: not having byte addressable ram will severly cripple my cpu when working with data sizes of less than 32 bits
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i need byte addressable memory because thats how my cpu operates
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for me yes
JC Denton#9567: Is that better than the HMM one someway?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: np, make sure to read the readme or you will be lost
JC Denton#9567: Thanks!

JC Denton#9567: cant find that in the thread
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: also if you need byte addressable ram download The Wild Jarvi memory mod aslo written by hexa :)
JC Denton#9567: 64kb is tons of RAM but I was thinking about storing lots of programs or such, but maybe 64kb is still enough
JC Denton#9567: Forgot that lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: nothing is stopping you from taking 4, 65kB rams and make a 256KB
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: should be plenty for a single component
PseudoGoose#2841: Well, depends on what you want to do. But you could definitely do a lot. That's more than an Arduino has
JC Denton#9567: I wonder if 64kb is enough memory
JC Denton#9567: Wow cool didn't think about that 😃
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/929472804078891120
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so the largest display in hmm is 256x256, so i took 4 of them and made a 512x512 display for my render engine
JC Denton#9567: I wonder if all of these have been done, should search the thread then
JC Denton#9567: Thanks for linking that
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <#910673109164638239>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hmm mod has the best displays so far
JC Denton#9567: don't mind crashes or something, I know about modding being experimental 😃
JC Denton#9567: I would like to try something like that if the mods can be downloaded from somewhere?
PseudoGoose#2841: Yeah, people have already done stuff like that, though modding support is still very experimental
JC Denton#9567: If you could then you could make an operating system for your own CPU
JC Denton#9567: Im not sure if I asked this before, but would it be possible to mod in high resolution screens, high capacity RAM/hard drives later on?
HuntaBadday#3556: Gud
CrispyPin#1149: you should be able to just copy the files over yea
HuntaBadday#3556: Can I run the server on a Windows machine without steam?
almafa64#1396: thanks for the help TheWildJarvi and Vinly Boot Maven of Shade
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i think its 4 ticks the relays take 1 tick to toggle
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's one using D-toggles that counts up and down, in 3 ticks.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's your design converted into a half adder counter that uses instant carry logic.
circuitgamer77#0377: To allow it to count down as well, you can use a full adder system and use two's compliment subtraction of 1 (all 1s being added)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah make it sync using the half adder from an instant carry adder
almafa64#1396: this is working (with the sorthener), but its slow, are there faster counters
almafa64#1396: thanks
almafa64#1396: i totally forgot to shorten the delayer output to 1 tick
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: That would be used for the clock input then
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/401255675264761868/928808300722655232/2022-01-0618-30-31_1920x1080.jpg
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I think what your looking for is a series of toggle flip flops. A d latch with an inverter from its output to its input makes a toggle flip flop
almafa64#1396: i tried different delays but its just dosnt work
almafa64#1396: can you send me a basic d-latch counter
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so you have to clock it at its slowest delay
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm you have it set up to ripple it looks like
almafa64#1396: 
almafa64#1396: i have this up counter design, i found out that this isnt working correctly, only the first 2 bits count right, the others count "randomly" <[newline]> somebody has a good up counter design
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Flip reverses the order of wire multiplace!?
circuitgamer77#0377: Nevermind, I forgot that I rebound 'flip' to delete...
circuitgamer77#0377: Is there a control to reverse the order of the group of pegs when multi-placing wires?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: like rotate a camera around some 3D object and do the lighting calc
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: id be happy to get a viewport thing working first
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: amazing

TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: shuddup im workin on it
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: make doom in LW
circuitgamer77#0377: I would suggest a calculator that can do addition/subtraction and display the result in hexadecimal, because it covers several good concepts/circuits and most of them are pretty easy to find instructions for.
circuitgamer77#0377: How beginner?  First circuit, basic understanding, or something else?
techminer71#8652: what would be a good beginner project
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't want to have to do a lookup table for every segment or every combination of bits
circuitgamer77#0377: Anyone have a mapping of 4 bits to 7 segment hex?  I know there's a simple(ish) way to hardwire it, but I don't know where to find it.
Rowwbit#5889: I have seen a couple of his videos but I think they were more advanced I'll go back and take another look at his earlier stuff, thanks
circuitgamer77#0377: Try Ben Eater on YouTube - he explains a lot of circuits very well, and it would probably be a good starting point.  (8 bit breadboard computer series, maybe?)
Rowwbit#5889: Can anyone give me some advice on the best way to learn? I have decent programming experience but logic gates always make me question my sanity. I can understand the individual gates functions but when you start tying them together it starts getting real confusing. I followed the youtube video below to make RAM and I get the concept of memory but what can I do with it now? Any advice is appreciated. I tried Turing Complete on steam as well but it doesn't really explain anything, its just "make this output i want". Thanks. To clarify im not an Electronics engineer and would prefer non hard science based answers, more "lay mans" approach. <[newline]>  <[newline]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1ioZLV6E4Q&t=346s&ab_channel=MichaelBauers

White Laurent#5414: is there an option in the game to redo a action?
White Laurent#5414: now it worked! thanks
Spider EveryOS#8098: Are you sure that the folder you got from the creation hub isn't corrupt? <[newline]> Also, make sure your unzip tool didn't nest the folder within another folder. In other words, if you open the folder created by your unzip tool, you should see some files (not just another folder and nothing else).
White Laurent#5414: Didn't for me :(
Spider EveryOS#8098: Thank you!
commander of the pandas#1576: hold z while selecting
Spider EveryOS#8098: -- <[newline]> Is there a way to grab or copy multiple circuit boards at once?
Spider EveryOS#8098: Unzipping them and copying them into saves works for me...
White Laurent#5414: or is this an known issue already?
White Laurent#5414: when I copy the folders into the right directory, it doesn't show up in the game
White Laurent#5414: does anybody knows how to access creations from the creation hub in the game?
Ecconia#4929: Let me say it like this then: Your tests are not useful, if you are using two different test sets, without running the tests several (many) times, to get an average result. <[newline]> Oracles are just the thing which generate the tests, using different tests is not a bad idea, but just not okay - if you do not collect an average result over several iterations.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i thought we were comparing relays to AND gates, not 2 seperate gpus.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Sorry, the statement "Oracles are a bad idea," bothers me. Performing the same test program is a way providing greater control, in order to minimize the effect of confounding variables, which is great. But randomness, and lack of control, is inevitable. 2 GPU's with the same design will perform differently, due to manufacturing tolerances, and ambient conditions. It boils down to what accuracy of results your looking for. To measure the difference of 2 GPU designs, such that you obtain a result of A GPU is x times faster than B GPU. Ideally, you'd want to run the same program, multiple times, on multiple copies of the same GPU design, under as close to the same ambient conditions as possible, for each GPU design. Then, the mean and standard deviation of the results will reflect the measurement and it's accuracy. In my case, all I'm interested in is whether or not a barrel shifter made of relays is faster than one made of and gates. So, the accuracy of the results can be considerably low and still provide a strong enough correlation to consider the result valid. And, the statement "Oracles are a bad idea," is rather vague, and depends on the scenario. For my test scenario, their use should be perfectly acceptable, given I run the test sufficiently enough times to obtain a reasonable mean and standard deviation.
Ecconia#4929: I will try to explain my thinking: <[newline]> Imagine having a GPU and performing a benchmark on it. <[newline]> Now if you use two different sets of tests, the benchmark will not give any valid result, since the result may change if you swap the tests. <[newline]> You want to have the same test running on each GPU for this benchmark, so that you can compare both GPUs fairly. <[newline]> Each different test stresses the hardware in different ways. <[newline]> Oracles generate a random test, so different hardware usage, hence different test result. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Oracles are not exactly bound to your save. They probably also have a system-time factor. <[newline]> So you cannot just load a save to get the same results, their output is as expected random. **I HOPE** <[newline]> Hence you rather want to have a fixed set of tests in a ROM for example, which will be run in the same order (to prevent side effects). <[newline]>  <[newline]> One could indeed use Oracles... but then you would have to run the tests several dozen times to get an average value. Which is representative.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Well. I wanted to test the performance of the build. Specifically a barrel shifter. If I wanted to measure performance of the relay vs and gate, yes I'd probably switch between 0 and 1 for both to isolate the switching behavior of the single component.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: youre checking for performmance of the sim, not the accuracy of the build afaik
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: dont worry about all combinations
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: If I set up a rom I'd still want a random set of inputs, which I'd generate with a psuedo random number generator to to test as many input variations as possible without hand crafting all 2^(2^37) possible inputs sequences.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: why not just set up a rom tho to be 100% sure?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I don't see how oracles are a bad idea. The input situation of the shifters are the same function. A psuedo random number generator. With a sufficient domain the statistical analysis should be perfectly sound.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and give both barrelshifters the same data
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: just make an input rom
Ecconia#4929: Oracles are a bad idea. You effectively want to have the same situation. <[newline]> And oracles provide a random situation. In average they might give similar load, but that is not granted.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: My guess is that, individually a relay may be more simulation intensive than an and, but with a series of them, like a barrel shifter, the ands enqueue more updates to propagate the signal which ends up more simulation intensive than the relays.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I used Oracle's to feed random input and selection bits for a 32 bit barrel shifter and set tps to 1 million to see how many ticks it skipped. Every 22 ticks I sent a 1 tick negative pulse to change the random values. I also put them in the same world so that the simulation data structure was identical for the operation of each shifter. The relays skipped 230-290k ticks most of the time, but the ands skipped 300k-400k most of the time and even went up to 600k ticks skipped.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: send it and see which one clocks a higher tps
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: one has the and gate version
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: one has the relay version
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah like an empty world
Ecconia#4929: I assume a good way to test would be to feed both devices with the same data at the same delay in ticks. <[newline]> However one is by nature more pipelined and the other not. <[newline]> Then you tell the server to go boost mode and try as many ticks as possible. <[newline]> As final step you just compare the amount of ticks reached. Given that the data is fed into the builds at the same tick delays, the result should speak for itself.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i thought the and gates would get a higher simulation rate over one made from pure relays
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: wym by skip time?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Has anyone tested relay vs and gate performance. I just made 2 identical 32bit barrel shifters, one from relays and the other from and gates. And the relays are consistently skipping less time at 1 Million tps, but I thought the relays performed worse.

Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Look up a k-map or Karnaugh map
!Chips#4890: i will try that c:
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: use a decoder/encoder
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ``` <[newline]> decoder input | encoder output <[newline]> ____________________________ <[newline]> 0001 | 0001 //1 thru 4 are less than 4 so output = input <[newline]> 0010 | 0010 <[newline]> 0011 | 0011 <[newline]> 0100 | 0100 <[newline]> 0101 | 1000 //5 thru 9 > 4 so encode input + 3 on the output <[newline]> 0110 | 1001 <[newline]> 0111 | 1010 <[newline]> 1000 | 1011 <[newline]> 1001 | 1100 <[newline]> ```
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: dont use an adder
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: oh youre doing bcd?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in the comparator box, is it checked signed or unsigned?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you have no idea how happy it makes me seeing you use digital
!Chips#4890: Still trying to make C from yesterday, I think it's going well
!Chips#4890: i guess i have actually because i made an adder/subtractor
!Chips#4890: I haven't worked with signed and unsigned numbers yet but I watched a video how 2's compliment etc
!Chips#4890: trying to make a comparator for my conditional adder
!Chips#4890: both?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: - 3 < 4 signed <[newline]> -3  > 4 unsigned
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm signed or unsigned
!Chips#4890: stupid question - If i want to detect if a binary number is higher than 4, do I need a 3 bit comparator?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: is it possible to give others on the server admin privledges?
GHXX#9078: yeah, def not possible since relays also have 1 tick switch delay
!Chips#4890: Thank you Ryan, I’ll read it

Ryan#9918: Ive been reading through this textbook and suggest you give it a shot: http://fuuu.be/polytech/INFOF201/Bouquin%20syst%C3%A8mes%20d_exploitations.pdf
CrispyPin#1149: not possible, that would allow instant logic
jaalte#8572: should be possible to make a 30hz computer if so
jaalte#8572: anyone think there's a way to make a not gate with only relays and fast buffers to avoid the 1 tick delay of the inverters?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: true, but this is 1 tick ;)
!Chips#4890: when all the input is off
!Chips#4890: ok that took me entirely way too long to understand, i think it's because i forgot the output starts at 0
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Otherwise each bit alternates between buffer and inverter. First bit alternates every 1, second every 2, 3rd every 4, 4th every 8 and so on.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: That's the easiest way.
Limón#7879: just step through it and connect all the inputs that are off to the inverter you want on
Limón#7879: 
Limón#7879: so if you want 0001 you take the 3 of the inputs and 1 of the inverted inputs and put it into the second inverter
Limón#7879: so when it's 0000 it's on
Limón#7879: so you take normal inputs and put it into the first inverter
Limón#7879: and normal
Limón#7879: you have inputs inverted
Limón#7879: so
!Chips#4890: I am very confused, because now i am learning about encoders and decoders and looking at https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901199821212352573/924783822246117456 wondering how he wired it
Ryan#9918: Connect the carry in and youre good
Ryan#9918: You can just stack full adders to get what you want.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you only need 1 thru 9
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this is a decoder that decodes 0 thru 15 for example <[newline]> https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901199821212352573/924783822246117456
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so do that part first
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so like you need a 4 bit decoder that decodes values 1 thru 9
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: just a regular one
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: not priority encoders
!Chips#4890: So i should be using priority encoders for the C blocks?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: from there you can get even fancier and just decode 5 thru 9 and encode it, then detect wheter input should pass thru or be encoded by the OR of the output of that decoder
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: those are those C blocks
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: uhm no need for fancy words xD basically <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> decoder input | encoder output <[newline]> ____________________________ <[newline]> 0001 | 0001 //1 thru 4 are less than 4 so output = input <[newline]> 0010 | 0010 <[newline]> 0011 | 0011 <[newline]> 0100 | 0100 <[newline]> 0101 | 1000 //5 thru 9 > 4 so encode input + 3 on the output <[newline]> 0110 | 1001 <[newline]> 0111 | 1010 <[newline]> 1000 | 1011 <[newline]> 1001 | 1100 <[newline]> ```
!Chips#4890: oh wow encoders are sick
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Oh, so the same function as a conditional adder, but directly mapped with a code translater?
Limón#7879: me when my adder is just an encoder 😳
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: much easier and faster than an adder
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: once you learn what a decoder and an encoder is, those C blocks can be made with them
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Hold on. That's easy for a single digit number. But it is a good starting place.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encoders-and-decoders-in-digital-logic/
!Chips#4890: i'll go do that
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you should learn what a decoder is
!Chips#4890: i can copy a logic gate diagram though
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hmm
!Chips#4890: nope
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you know what a decoder is?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the easiest way is to not use an adder and to use an decoder/encoder
!Chips#4890: yea i'm just trying to learn how to convert my adder binary into decimals on a 7 segment display
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: those blocks just represent the double dabble algo for 4 bits
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: they can be implemented in whatever way you want
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no theyre not
!Chips#4890: maybe not sure what a lookup table is, i'll go look it up
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: That would be one way.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Like a lookup table?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: ?
!Chips#4890: then i just need to make some memory storing which segments to turn on in a 7 segment display for full conversion?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: np
!Chips#4890: ty ty!
!Chips#4890: lmaoo oooh
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yup
!Chips#4890: oh hold on, are those Cs 4 bit adders?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Ok cool. Now you just need that to be tiled for 4 bits. Sockets can make that pretty easy.
!Chips#4890: 
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Have you made a full adder in lw? Basically you make a normal adder, but one of the inputs is either 0 or 3.
!Chips#4890: yea i just found that after looking up conditional adder, how do I make the adder have 4 inputs and 4 outputs?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Um.. not sure what that is tbh. A full adder would have 2 inputs for each bit.
!Chips#4890: hmm
!Chips#4890: like this?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Actually, they are conditional adders.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yup
!Chips#4890: I am looking at this and wondering what the Cs are, are they full adders?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Sure
!Chips#4890: I am trying to understand how to do a double dabble algorithm in game but I'm not getting it, anyone mind teaching me a bit?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: np
sarene!#6589: thank you!
sarene!#6589: ,,oh that's clever actually
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: You can also make one for x and one for y axis and use and gates in the memory to make a 2d address matrix.
sarene!#6589: huh. still a bit messy but that buffer/inverter thing is interesting
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's how I make mine.
sarene!#6589: mine look like    uhh, this right now
sarene!#6589: yeah, something to activate the memory cell that corresponds to the address given
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Like a 1-hot decoder?
sarene!#6589: any tips for decoders as well, actually? mine are a bit of a mess right now even just for 3 bits
sarene!#6589: oooh i didn't know about multi wire, thanks. and 64kb was a pipe dream anyway. i'll mess around with sockets as well
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: using ctrl you can multi wire. Also, with sockets you can make modules of like 16 bytes or so and copy and paste them. Though 64kb will likely not work until later updates.
sarene!#6589: hey y'all, new to logic world, not sure where to check for something like this. i've been making an 8 bit cpu and it's been an awful lot of wiring for buses and memory. is there a simpler way ~~or do i have to wire up 64kb of ram myself~~
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Invert the output and feed it back into the input
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: You have a data flip flop component in game
Grumpy_Evan_#4169: Could someone please help me with a toggle flip-flop design? I've been following tutorials on the internet meant for breadboards but it hasn't been working.
MS#5409: Eh nah  <[newline]> Ive got the stuff works rn
GHXX#9078: but if you want it now, you can throw it in
GHXX#9078: well i do agree it should be part of the base game
MS#5409: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
GHXX#9078: its base game code, but you can still edit that using a mod
MS#5409: Whats holding you back 😉 😝
MS#5409: This is base game lvl stuff
MS#5409: No
GHXX#9078: ~~make a mod 😛~~
Ecconia#4929: Technically... It is super easy to write a third party world downloader client... I have all the code for that, lol. <[newline]> -> Network and save code.
MS#5409: <@154964593397989376> you should have it throw a warning at those who are admins on a server if the server isn't actually able to save/backup the world
MS#5409: Ik
GHXX#9078: if you modify anything simply chown
MS#5409: Ive had it happen 3 times
MS#5409: Yes but if i do that it will screw with the file permission and it doesn't want to save after that
GHXX#9078: just log in with your account, that hopefully has sudo access, and then you can access anything
MS#5409: It doesn't even have a home folder
MS#5409: Well the account doesn't allow direct ssh <[newline]> And yes i can do su steam but that account can only access that specific folder
GHXX#9078: but like SSHing in would be way easier
MS#5409: 99% of its usage is as a nextcloud server
GHXX#9078: why
GHXX#9078: 😲
MS#5409: I shut it down and connect the drive (ssd) to my laptop and edit it that way
Ryan#9918: ^
GHXX#9078: there is probs a sudo account that allows login, then simply sudo su whatevertheserveraccountis and you are good to go
Ryan#9918: What do you do if you need to do maintenance in the server, seems counter intuitive lol
MS#5409: But that account cant be logged into for safety
MS#5409: <@408081839870181377> The server is locally hosted but ive made it so only the account that has access to that folder is the one that hosts it
MS#5409: Yes i own that domain but sadly i can't send a copy of the world bc it is a PITA to download it
Ryan#9918: Right
Limón#7879: also you have to connect the final cout of the half adders to your decoders cout
Ryan#9918: right
Limón#7879: half adder before decoding
Ryan#9918: its ok, I am too
Limón#7879: I am tired
Ryan#9918: Ah ok
Limón#7879: I forgot the line
Limón#7879: xor
Ryan#9918: Those are or gates there, right?
Limón#7879: 
Ryan#9918: That part I understand
Limón#7879: 
Ryan#9918: display 1 should be 5 and display 2 should be 1. Which makes sense with the final bit rolling over
Ryan#9918: Actually, no
Ryan#9918: Because if I have 1111 and I have two displays, the first should display 1 and the other should display 5. but with the overflow I would need something to fulfill the condition for 1 to show up on the first display regardless.
Ryan#9918: Yeah at least in regards to a 7 segment display
Limón#7879: carry logic?
Limón#7879: of what
Ryan#9918: You mind shooting over a visual?
Limón#7879: you can just use half adders for the carry logic
Limón#7879: at least that's how I do my BCD
Limón#7879: otherwise it's easier for just hex display
Limón#7879: like larger than 1001 needs to carry to the next 4 bits
Limón#7879: if you want BCD you have to do some weird stuff
Ryan#9918: I never thought to hook them up
Ryan#9918: they're all individual
Ryan#9918: Actually, the displays aren't connected like that
Limón#7879: and stuff for larger than 9 numbers
Limón#7879: do they already have carry logic
Ryan#9918: and each one has 4 inputs
Ryan#9918: They're just 0-9 displays
Limón#7879: (which you could get rid of one because 4 bits = 1 display)
Limón#7879: just hooks them up normally and leave 4 inputs blank
Limón#7879: if they are hex displays
Limón#7879: so you want to hook up 16 to 20?
Ryan#9918: And I KNOW the answer is really simple but I'm drawing a blank 😩
Ryan#9918: So I'm not sure what the proper way to go about hooking up my multiple displays would be
Ryan#9918: Ok so, I'm wracking my brain here and can't figure this out. I have an 8bit multiplier that has a total of 16 output bits. I want to hook that up to several 7 segment displays. The highest number it can multiply to is 37628. So I have 5 displays in total however, that would require a total of 20 inputs, 4 for each display. However 16 != 20
circuitgamer77#0377: It's displayed on the side when you are selecting the world in singleplayer, but I don't know about multiplayer.
commander of the pandas#1576: How to check how many components a world has? Just curious
Foxer#0359: There are so many commands to look through. I guess I will try. Thanks for the tip.
GHXX#9078: <@408081839870181377> i think there is a console command for saving the server world <[newline]> just type  <[newline]> 'help' <[newline]> in the console
Foxer#0359: <@!327048348303622145> Hey, you have dms off, so I am sending this here. Do you own the server ms26.ddns.net ? If so, I would appreciate a world download. I have done so much stuff in the world that I would not like to lose. Thanks if this is you. If it's too big to send over discord you can upload it to logicworld.net and send me the link.
Imatsu#1843: Whelp. Got far enough to understand how to build an edge detector thing...but for some reason when I try to test it it makes my SR latch build just blink incessantly. 🥴 lmao
Imatsu#1843: I'll look it up though; thanks
Imatsu#1843: Doesn't have to be LW specifically; as long as it details which logic gates/circuits are used.
zplilpz#9574: I'm not aware of anything exactly for LW, but you could follow ben eaters 8-bit cpu build on youtube, i think a few people have built that cpu in LW and ben does an amazing job of explaining how everything works.
Imatsu#1843: Alrighty so I keep looking at the shortcut to start LW and wanting to open it and build something cool...but I'm way too noob to come up with anything to build. Does anyone know of a decent source of a step-by-step building tutorial? I'd prefer it to go through each portion of a build rather than just offer up a finished one.
jaalte#8572: thx
GHXX#9078: yes
jaalte#8572: I'll try that out later
jaalte#8572: oh if you're holding it it'll let you?
GHXX#9078: but if you grab and then delete it would
jaalte#8572: i came up with a workaround though, bound delete to right click and i have an auto clicker that pulverizes stuff
GHXX#9078: if you want to delete the board then it wont work
GHXX#9078: it should work
jaalte#8572: oh and this doesn't work if there's stuff on it, you gotta remove all the components on top of it first
jaalte#8572: the keybinding system in this game is awesome, if this was open source it'd be my go-to
GHXX#9078: just use a c# decompiler. you effectively much get the source code but without comments
a_username#7623: ah shucks, thats alright then. i got a little exp on unity and the game has got great potential 😄
RyanT#1426: Jimmy (the main dev) has plans to open source it far in the future, but rn the only option is to decompile it or not have the source code
RyanT#1426: Right now, the game is closed source
a_username#7623: hey guys, not sure if this is the right place for asking if we could get access to the source code? i was thinking of suggesting or working on some features but only found the old repo haha
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Just copy that and substitute [ticks/s] for the value you want
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Without brackets
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: server "simulation.rate [ticks/s]"
MS#5409: what was the command to change server speed/simulation speed
GHXX#9078: grab the board, and then delete it
jaalte#8572: cause i duplicated a chunky 8-byte storage array i made, but it's outdated now and it'll take way too long to clear out like that
jaalte#8572: yo is there a way to delete a circuit board with stuff on it without removing it all first?
Limón#7879: was it just a output peg feedback issue
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: I solved it, but it took more space and two fast buffers
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Not now, but it comes from the left socket, goes to the buffer, then into the other buffer and into the right socket. The path that feedbacks is: comes from the left socket into the center socket and from between the buffers into the center socket too, so the signal travels back into the first buffer again and holds a 1
Limón#7879: can you give top down view?
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: <@859806257774723102> this is the problem I encountered with. I saw that there was an option were pegs can be changed in a way so the signal only goes from input to output, so no feedback if there is an input in the way, like in the example
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: solution is on <#901195561980543007>
Sekoia#3968: kk
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Nevermind, I came with a solution
Sekoia#3968: you need a fast buffer
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: I think no one is online, awesome
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: I want the signal to follow the red path, but because there is no direction restriction, it flows like the blue arrow creating a feedback that holds a constant HIGH and I don't want that
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Well, in case that this option still working and wasn't removed
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: How do I make pegs one way only? I saw in a video that they could act as OR gates without feedback and I want to do it but I don't know the key
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you can put a peg in between
HuntaBadday#3556: Very sad
HuntaBadday#3556: :(
Stefan#5422: yes
HuntaBadday#3556: Is there a max length for wires
circuitgamer77#0377: You're welcome :)
HuntaBadday#3556: Thank you
HuntaBadday#3556: The flip key worked
HuntaBadday#3556: ...
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't think so, but I think there's a flip key.  Not sure - I haven't used it.
HuntaBadday#3556: So is it not possible to grab the other side of the board?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think shift-rotate only works when a board is mounted on its edge
HuntaBadday#3556: Ye
circuitgamer77#0377: Rotate should, but shift rotate shouldn't I think.
HuntaBadday#3556: I remember it working before
HuntaBadday#3556: It doesn't do anything when it's flat?
circuitgamer77#0377: To confirm I'm understanding - before you hit T it works, then you hit T, which makes it flat on the parent, then hit T again and it doesn't work?  Because shift-rotate shouldn't do anything when it's flat.
HuntaBadday#3556: Nothing is conflicting, I can use the Shift rotate, but after I press T it stops working
circuitgamer77#0377: I had to rebind something for them to work, there was a conflicting keybind that didn't look like it was conflicting.  Maybe check that?
HuntaBadday#3556: Not working
circuitgamer77#0377: Then shift + rotate left or right is right
HuntaBadday#3556: Grabbing the other side
HuntaBadday#3556: Just using the other side of the board
HuntaBadday#3556: Not move the grab point
circuitgamer77#0377: But to move the grab point it's a different set of controls.
circuitgamer77#0377: For rotating, yes
HuntaBadday#3556: I remember being able to use Shift + Q or E after pressing T, has this ever been a thing?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think it's IJKL by default, but I could be wrong there.  I've rebound them to my numpad.
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know if you can, but you can use alt or the nudge keys to move where you are holding it after you grab it.
HuntaBadday#3556: When I grab a board how do I grab a specific side? When I pick the front or back it grabs the front no matter what
Verlio_H#0201: ^ won't fix
Limón#7879: jimmmmmyyy fiixxxx gammmmmeee
Ecconia#4929: using TCP that is
Ecconia#4929: I am amazed that you actually got it running...
MS#5409: will change it then
MS#5409: lol
MS#5409: oh....
Ecconia#4929: No, 100% UDP.
MS#5409: isnt the game running on tcp?
Ecconia#4929: <@!327048348303622145> I know it works now, but your forwarding issue might have been using TCP instead of UDP... Oops
Ecconia#4929: It should be.
GHXX#9078: thanks for pointing it out
GHXX#9078: you are right
GHXX#9078: shit
GHXX#9078: OH
Ecconia#4929: UDP though. Not TCP...
Ecconia#4929: Well that in general is a bad idea - for everything. Except if you do not want to provide any comfort to your users and just let them garbage their accounts. But that is just my opinion. <[newline]> -> But yes your confusion is justified. I also think that name-based verification sucks hell. And I pray that MouseHatGames will change it eventually. Fun fact, users do have an ID (the one from the DB) and it is even exposed to public.
MS#5409: eh it already works
Ecconia#4929: Or you provide the `--plain-text` argument. (It was something like this...)
totobono4#5551: But maybe for this game the steam version is the **__exact__** same than the itch.io version 🤔
totobono4#5551: In my mind buying the non-steam files is better than copying the steam files because I will need multiples folders with the game eventually, and also I love the game 🤔
CrispyPin#1149: or just run it without steam
totobono4#5551: I'll buy the game again but on the official website, it will fix my problem for sure x)
MS#5409: _nice_
MS#5409: my game just crashed and when i loaded it again this showed up
totobono4#5551: When I'm trying to close the game in task manager, it says I'm not allowed to close it, even in admin mode x)
CrispyPin#1149: steam (client) bad
Stenodyon#8192: This happens to me when I use one of the buttons to open a game folder, if I don't close the file explorer window the game process won't stop
Blockmaster100#9931: ive had it in other games and to fix it i either go into task manager and close the game located within steam or i wait a bit until it decides to close
totobono4#5551: Every time I'm playing the game, when I stop it steam won't stop "running" the game, I think the problem comes from steam, I don't know why and this is awfull 'cause I can't launch any game 'till I restart steam, what means enter the a2f etc.. someone had this problem ?
totobono4#5551: Yes
Aszriel#3004: Turing complete, it's a game right ?
totobono4#5551: I'm playing Turing Complete and I want to rebuild all to Logic World :3
Aszriel#3004: i'm just looking at most diagram since it's easy to find on the internet
Aszriel#3004: I'll try to build each mathematic operation, it's my first time trying such stuff but i can be quite funny, interesting and educative to reproduce in a game
Aszriel#3004: I see, ty !
totobono4#5551: Yes you have the D-Latch with wich you can save the value, and if you want to load just use a relayer.
Aszriel#3004: in term of logic gate register can be created using the D-latch component on this game right ? <[newline]> by register I mean CPU register for instance
MS#5409: i have set the port ti 5828
MS#5409: its working
GHXX#9078: any errors?
GHXX#9078: thats weird
GHXX#9078: what
MS#5409: well i have to restart it once before it actually loads
GHXX#9078: if it doesnt run as root
GHXX#9078: thats good though
MS#5409: im gonna reboot the server and see if it helps
MS#5409: yes that root _DO NOT QUESTION IT_ (steam user inst root)
MS#5409: but... it now runs as the steam user
MS#5409: nope
GHXX#9078: over the internet
GHXX#9078: from outside too?
MS#5409: it works now
MS#5409: yay'
GHXX#9078: now reconnect
GHXX#9078: yeah
MS#5409: lol
MS#5409: ok?
MS#5409: that very hidden
MS#5409: just noticed
GHXX#9078: 
GHXX#9078: log in ingame
MS#5409: 
GHXX#9078: then log in
MS#5409: i do
GHXX#9078: sec
GHXX#9078: that doesnt make a difference
MS#5409: so....
GHXX#9078: do you have a LW account?
MS#5409: i got it on steam
MS#5409: how?
GHXX#9078: did you log in via your LW account?
GHXX#9078: ooh
MS#5409: i mean this
MS#5409: rn i cant connect to the server
GHXX#9078: in steamapps/common/logicworld
GHXX#9078: by editing the config of your local server
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: ha!!
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: hahahahaha
GHXX#9078: really mean person sitting over at 127.0.0.1
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: ha i hacked you!!!
MS#5409: 😜
MS#5409: good luck
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: im gonna hack that person right now
MS#5409: rn local connection also doenst work
GHXX#9078: thats the advantage of ipv6, even if you leak it, it still takes like 2 years to enter
Limón#7879: someone's bout to hack you through through 8080
MS#5409: oh how do i enable the verify on the client
MS#5409: ive got nothing important open
Limón#7879: 😭
MS#5409: meh
GHXX#9078: xD
GHXX#9078: public one was leaked before
GHXX#9078: thats the local one
Limón#7879: IP LEAKED XD!! (I know it's local ip)
MS#5409: 
GHXX#9078: i had a similar issue when i hosted a local LW server, where the modem saved the configuration but somehow didnt apply it, and at some point it magically did apply it
GHXX#9078: might be some modem weirdness then
MS#5409: 43531 yes
GHXX#9078: did you forward the port on your modem?
MS#5409: its a local pc (next to the router)
MS#5409: the local one cant connect bc it fails to verify
MS#5409: oh
MS#5409: the server is downstairs
MS#5409: lan
GHXX#9078: are you running this lw server in your lan or on a vps/server ?
MS#5409: when doing a check
MS#5409: game doenst detect it
MS#5409: also nothing
MS#5409: ipv4
MS#5409: IPv6 doesnt work
MS#5409: IPv6 doesnt work
GHXX#9078: cuz you will have ipv6 support in your lan, but maybe not for the internet, depending on your isp
GHXX#9078: thats what fixed it for me
GHXX#9078: well try to set the server ip mode to ipv4
GHXX#9078: ah
MS#5409: thats my local one (192.168.2.10)
MS#5409: yeah
GHXX#9078: or is that local?
GHXX#9078: the top one is green
GHXX#9078: but it works, right?
MS#5409: being able to see the server from outside my network
GHXX#9078: what's the issue right now?
MS#5409: the ports are open as well
GHXX#9078: i only got 4
GHXX#9078: nice
MS#5409: We have both 6 and 4
GHXX#9078: cuz many ISPs dont offer ipv6 support yet for some dumb reason....
GHXX#9078: i recommend setting it to ipv4
MS#5409: was it ipv4/6/both
MS#5409: although portforward isnt happy
MS#5409: 🥳
GHXX#9078: sweet
MS#5409: yay
GHXX#9078: ok nice, i guess change the MOTD, boot it up and see if the motd appears ingame
MS#5409: Yup
GHXX#9078: did you install it via steamcmd im assuming?
GHXX#9078: well, at least it works
GHXX#9078: odd
GHXX#9078: hm according to the wiki arch's format is the same
MS#5409: It runs now
MS#5409: Probably
GHXX#9078: hm ok, maybe its an arch vs ubuntu difference
MS#5409: I just had to swap the arguments
GHXX#9078: i just double checked, my symlink command should be right
MS#5409: I don't think so
MS#5409: But for the symlinks was made inside the GamdData folder
GHXX#9078: so, my command is wrong?
MS#5409: Ik
GHXX#9078: thats what it should be like
GHXX#9078: 
MS#5409: Otherwise it would make symlinks inside the folde pointing into it
GHXX#9078: hm?
MS#5409: <@109262887310065664> i had to swap the gamedata symlink
GHXX#9078: thats why id recommend you to follow the steps in my install tutorial rather closely
GHXX#9078: when you install it to <[newline]> /a/b/c <[newline]> It will actually also create files in /a/b
MS#5409: Rn im eating😅
GHXX#9078: well you can install steamcmd using your package manager
MS#5409: I don't have steam on the server
GHXX#9078: oh
MS#5409: Copy paste
MS#5409: Nope
GHXX#9078: did you install it using steamcmd?
GHXX#9078: so i had to add a symlink
MS#5409: Wtf 🤣
GHXX#9078: 😂
GHXX#9078: but its in the wrong place
GHXX#9078: automatically
GHXX#9078: the lw server comes with a gamedata folder
MS#5409: Its physically on a different computer
MS#5409: I did rename the server folder to Server
GHXX#9078: hm, i added a symlink instead of moving it
MS#5409: All of it
MS#5409: Yes
GHXX#9078: did you manually move the gamedata folder?
GHXX#9078: then we got different layouts
MS#5409: Nope
GHXX#9078: for the LW server
GHXX#9078: do you use a symlink anywhere?
MS#5409: Does that look correct
MS#5409: Ok so its <[newline]>  /server/LogicWorldServer/Server/Server <excitable> <[newline]> /server/LogicWorldServer/logs
GHXX#9078: check if the logs folder is near the executable
MS#5409: doesnt make logs
MS#5409: even runnning ./Server
GHXX#9078: but that would also explain why your config doesnt get read
MS#5409: idk
GHXX#9078: maybe your working dir is broken then, idk
MS#5409: also i need to eat
MS#5409: its empty
GHXX#9078: yea
MS#5409: 
MS#5409: that one?
GHXX#9078: and logic_world_ds contains the server executable
MS#5409: ....
GHXX#9078: 
MS#5409: nothing is in there
GHXX#9078: in a folder called logs inside the server files
MS#5409: where are the logs located
MS#5409: i cant even find the logs
MS#5409: hold on
GHXX#9078: yeah, not sure what else to check
MS#5409: nothing in the logs
MS#5409: nope
GHXX#9078: is there anything in the logs?
MS#5409: just running it by had
MS#5409: i guess i can add cd <to server folder>
MS#5409: that only runs the /usr/bin/LogicWorld file
GHXX#9078: i mean in your systemd unit file
MS#5409: 
MS#5409: i am in that folder
GHXX#9078: before you run the server
GHXX#9078: maybe try setting the working directory via cd
MS#5409: the config file is in the same folder as the Server file
MS#5409: what the
GHXX#9078: then its not using the config file
MS#5409: this is the output
MS#5409: i also did .MS26
GHXX#9078: cuz that could be treated as a string on the right side theoretically
GHXX#9078: maybe add a ! between VerifiedMode and :
MS#5409: for syntacs
GHXX#9078: dunno
GHXX#9078: hmm
MS#5409: enough?
GHXX#9078: like, turn that into <[newline]> ```Admin_IDs! <[newline]>     . MS26```
GHXX#9078: can you produce a syntax error in that config file to ensure its actually using it
MS#5409: sudo systemctl restart LogicWorldServer.service
MS#5409: yeah
GHXX#9078: did you restart the server after saving the config file?
GHXX#9078: 🤔
MS#5409: 
MS#5409: ive set it to true in the settings
MS#5409: hmm its not working
MS#5409: nope
GHXX#9078: "MS"?
MS#5409: nope
GHXX#9078: is it "ms"? 😂
MS#5409: but its  better than none
MS#5409: although its just 2 letter
GHXX#9078: perfect
MS#5409: i have both
GHXX#9078: if you run verified mode = false i strongly suggest setting a password
MS#5409: no it should be forwarded
MS#5409: there we go
GHXX#9078: port is in the cfg file
GHXX#9078: well, at least it works now i suppose. <[newline]> Im not sure if admin it actually does something ingame, but the format definitely works for the whitelist
GHXX#9078: ~~tcp~~ udp
MS#5409: oh is it TCP or UDP
MS#5409: i cant help it at times
MS#5409: i have a issue with processing stuff
MS#5409: ..............
GHXX#9078: bruh
MS#5409: .... that took looooooong to realise
MS#5409: ah
MS#5409: oh wait
MS#5409: oh?
GHXX#9078: so there is no point in using a number instead of text
GHXX#9078: and with verified mode those names are unique anyway
MS#5409: yeah thats true
Liizzii#0001: Remember the game is still in early stages of it's development. the user system will probably improve over time
GHXX#9078: like literally, if you keep complaining, then dont use it 😓
MS#5409: ...
GHXX#9078: make a mod <:blobshrug:317430082325184522>
MS#5409: either from a permanent id given form a server or one that gets generated once the game is installed
MS#5409: i was expecting to find some kind on id system
GHXX#9078: at least you didnt have to figure it out yourself
MS#5409: 11/10 safe
GHXX#9078: like it says right here
MS#5409: omg
GHXX#9078: then make it <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> Admin_IDs: <[newline]>     - MS26```
MS#5409: 
MS#5409: MS26
GHXX#9078: whats your LW username?
MS#5409: ok
MS#5409: what the hell.....
GHXX#9078: just put in the username
GHXX#9078: ?
MS#5409: this
MS#5409: uh nvm
GHXX#9078: did it crash
GHXX#9078: did the server not boot up
GHXX#9078: how did you notice that you arent an admin
MS#5409: language barrier . . . .
MS#5409: ....
GHXX#9078: how does it manifest itself that you arent an admin?
MS#5409: i still cant get it to actually make me admin
MS#5409: ok
GHXX#9078: verified true means: <[newline]> needs a lw account <[newline]> verified false: <[newline]> doesn't need a lw account and everyone can choose the username freely
MS#5409: oh wait didnt realise you need a LW account for that
GHXX#9078: using a password
GHXX#9078: or only let people play that you trust
GHXX#9078: and names gonna be unique probs
GHXX#9078: then everyone has to make a lw account
GHXX#9078: as i said, literally just switch verified mode to true
GHXX#9078: you can get it on itch io or something
MS#5409: plz tell me im wrong
MS#5409: is this correct?
MS#5409: so correct me if im wrong but to be admin all you have to do is rename yourself to one of the admin names
MS#5409: not saying its bad but it a admin issue
MS#5409: this is so... not great to know
MS#5409: or have it get an id from a server that will be permanent
RyanT#1426: you can buy it on itch and game jolt I think, and also logicworld.net in the future
MS#5409: eh ok
GHXX#9078: ^
RyanT#1426: because you can buy it not on steam
GHXX#9078: cuz lw uses lw accounts
MS#5409: why not steamid based
GHXX#9078: but they are unique i guess, if verified mode is on
MS#5409: why....
MS#5409: oh god
GHXX#9078: yep
MS#5409: is this seriously name based?
GHXX#9078: ^
Limón#7879: /amdamn
Limón#7879: amdamn
MS#5409: ok so how do i add my self as admin?
MS#5409: i cant seem to fix it rn
MS#5409: ...
GHXX#9078: <:vvScared:580599760826793984>
MS#5409: i will run it as root
MS#5409: fuck it
MS#5409: the moment i add the `User=noah` it fails
MS#5409: the issue is with it running in my user
MS#5409: no its a systemd thing
GHXX#9078: maybe cd to the LW server first
MS#5409: nope
GHXX#9078: does it fail for a certain reason?
MS#5409: i can try that
MS#5409: tried it but it fails
GHXX#9078: or try  <[newline]> /bin/bash /usr/bin/LogicWorld
GHXX#9078: or put in the command directly, thats contained in LogicWorld
GHXX#9078: in the systemd unit file
GHXX#9078: oh, or maybe try the full path to /usr/bin/LogicWorld
MS#5409: ive never even used crontab
MS#5409: but i prefer systemd because im more familiar with it
GHXX#9078: then it runs as your user
GHXX#9078: what you could do is just make a crontab entry to have it run it for you on reboot
MS#5409: yeah
GHXX#9078: group has rwx
MS#5409: ?
GHXX#9078: so it should work
GHXX#9078: owner, group,all
Limón#7879: 🏳️‍⚧️
GHXX#9078: wait im dumb
MS#5409: so owner and group and run it for sure
MS#5409: yeah
GHXX#9078: last bit is execute i think
MS#5409: but its set to 775
MS#5409: as in root:noah
MS#5409: owned by root and i am in the group
GHXX#9078: is that file owned by root?
MS#5409: that is `LogicWorld`  <[newline]> i made a file in `/usr/bin/LogicWorld` that has the tmux command
GHXX#9078: like <[newline]> tmux logicworld something something
GHXX#9078: can you run the command that the service runs ?
MS#5409: but i can also run `LogicWorld` manually and then it also works
MS#5409: it will be root
MS#5409: if i dont set `User=noah` in the service it works
GHXX#9078: cuz if it does you could just use crontab instead
MS#5409: no thats not it
GHXX#9078: i.e. without the systemd service stuff
MS#5409: umm
MS#5409: well
GHXX#9078: does it work if you run the server using tmux manually?
GHXX#9078: oh
MS#5409: tmux is basically that but v2.0
MS#5409: screw it i will run it as root
GHXX#9078: you could use screen :P
MS#5409: it might just be that it doesnt wanna run as me
GHXX#9078: im not experienced with that tho
GHXX#9078: maybe it's something with the systemd unit file then
MS#5409: file permissions arent the issue (i think)
MS#5409: if i run `LogicWorld` to starts the server without any issue
MS#5409: in there i also have it set to me
MS#5409: in the Server folder is the actual server
MS#5409: i have ownership of all of the files
MS#5409: yes
MS#5409: 
GHXX#9078: recursively i should add
GHXX#9078: you could try runbing the server yourself using your noah user, maybe you get some more insight from that
Liizzii#0001: all i can guess is that since you switched from running as root to your user, but stuff is still owned as root something isn't liking it
Liizzii#0001: hmm
MS#5409: this is all
Liizzii#0001: hmm, what about the output from systemctl for the unit? does that show anything?
GHXX#9078: did you chown?
MS#5409: it only works when running it as root
MS#5409: got an old one
Limón#7879: 🇪
MS#5409: 
GHXX#9078: does it make a new one each time you run the start cmd?
MS#5409: wrong one
MS#5409: hmm
MS#5409: 
GHXX#9078: maybe check the lw logs
MS#5409: the sh file i used to launch tmux is set to root:noah and has 755
MS#5409: i have ownership over the logic world folder
Liizzii#0001: 755 also doesn't give executable flag (or whatever it's called) for the group. your best bet would to just be to `chown noah:noah -R <folder>` the files
MS#5409: so
MS#5409: but the group is me
Liizzii#0001: yeah, they're owned by root
MS#5409: ...
MS#5409: doesnt that ...
MS#5409: oh wait
MS#5409: and set to 755
MS#5409: its root:noah on them
Liizzii#0001: check ownership of the files, make sure they're not owened by root
MS#5409: one sec
MS#5409: if i do `User=noah` (my username) it doesnt start at all
GHXX#9078: username without the @ btw
MS#5409: ah
GHXX#9078: succ cfg is the same
MS#5409: i use arch based
GHXX#9078: the format of the admin and whitelist is pretty strict from my experience
MS#5409: thats for ubuntu
GHXX#9078: either your LW username or the one you can set ingame
GHXX#9078: its the username
GHXX#9078: check https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/922694866016817152
GHXX#9078: edit the config file
Liizzii#0001: i think you can tell systemd to run the server as a particular user
GHXX#9078: oof
MS#5409: yeah...
MS#5409: hmm
MS#5409: root
Liizzii#0001: ah
Liizzii#0001: ah, might be either root or the nobody user or something
MS#5409: oh oops
MS#5409: never gave one
Liizzii#0001: hmm, what user is the server running as?
MS#5409: what what the!?
MS#5409: to add to the admin
MS#5409: oh um how do you get the player id's
MS#5409: now i need to portforward it
MS#5409: ...
MS#5409: took me way to long to realize i also needed to do `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
Liizzii#0001: woo
MS#5409: 
MS#5409: <@!125573811327205376>its working
MS#5409: remade the service file  <[newline]> and this is the output when started
MS#5409: that works
MS#5409: i will try it through the terminal 1st
Liizzii#0001: I'm not sure how well it'll work in a unit file, because I've never actually done it that way , but you _should_ be able to set the launch command to `tmux new-session -d -s my_session_name '/path/to/server/executable'` <[newline]> `-d` means to detach after start. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Not 100% sure what unit type you'll want for this way though
MS#5409: any idea how to set it up? <[newline]> tmux doesnt want to run with the command (launch agument)
MS#5409: <https://superuser.com/questions/1581577/running-two-tmux-sessions-as-systemd-service> <[newline]> time to try it
MS#5409: or screen
MS#5409: hmm that means i would have to start it through something like tmux
Liizzii#0001: Yeah, your unit file looks good, i guess the interactive console is throwing it off
MS#5409: i didnt realize it was a interactive console
MS#5409: here it is
MS#5409: uh sure
MS#5409: that means i will have to use tmux (somehow)
MS#5409: XD
Liizzii#0001: I believe so, yeah
MS#5409: wait... does this game use an interactive server console?
Liizzii#0001: That's uh... special. Post your unit file maybe?
MS#5409: 
MS#5409: <@!316553438186045441> trying to make it a systemd service causes a service crash (oops)
totobono4#5551: That make sense
MS#5409: it also doesnt help that my native language isnt english
MS#5409: oh well now that it works... time to make it auto start
MS#5409: and in this case i never realised it was `./Server` instead of `./server`
MS#5409: of the command
CrispyPin#1149: i asked what the output was.
MS#5409: +7 makes it dificult to see individual letters at times
MS#5409: sorry i never realised it was an uppercase s
CrispyPin#1149: instead of this
CrispyPin#1149: if you had said this earlier that would have been helpful.
MS#5409: im blind sometimes
MS#5409: ./**S**erver
MS#5409: 
MS#5409: oh FFS
totobono4#5551: But this is Server
CrispyPin#1149: filenames are case sensitive on linux
Liizzii#0001: try with `./Server`
CrispyPin#1149: it's ./Server
Erikbot#6368: ls
MS#5409: this
CrispyPin#1149: and what is the output?
MS#5409: ./server
CrispyPin#1149: ?
MS#5409: it runs monjaro server version
MS#5409: i have a server (old pc) downstairs  <[newline]> i am trying to host on that server a LW server
MS#5409: i did
CrispyPin#1149: i have no idea what the fuck you are doing
CrispyPin#1149: had you not moved the files before?
CrispyPin#1149: what
MS#5409: ok i copied this now to the server
CrispyPin#1149: what
MS#5409: thats what confuses me
MS#5409: i know 🤔
CrispyPin#1149: you don't need wine, it's native linux
CrispyPin#1149: what are you typing to start it?
MS#5409: With wine it does complain
MS#5409: It said ther was nothing to run for me
MS#5409: 🤔
CrispyPin#1149: this is what i get with just the files steam gives me
CrispyPin#1149: ok
MS#5409: Only vnc screens
MS#5409: I don't have a screen on the server
MS#5409: Uh yeah
CrispyPin#1149: are you running it from terminal?
MS#5409: No output no errors nothing
MS#5409: It doesn't absolutely nothing
MS#5409: Nothing
CrispyPin#1149: what happens when you run it?
CrispyPin#1149: that doesnt answer my question
MS#5409: Like its never started
MS#5409: I will try again in a moment
CrispyPin#1149: like no output at all?
MS#5409: Ok but it doesn't even start
totobono4#5551: Some things are explained here, for example how to run the server without steam, and also on linux.
CrispyPin#1149: 
CrispyPin#1149: you need to move the everything but gameData into a folder deeper
MS#5409: With wine it does complain tho
Stenodyon#8192: wow that's weird
MS#5409: If i try to launch it outside it does nothing
MS#5409: If i launch it through steam it works
MS#5409: Nothing at all happenes
MS#5409: Nope
Stenodyon#8192: hmmm do you get an error message ?
MS#5409: Arch linux on my laptop
MS#5409: Nope linux
Stenodyon#8192: If you have installed the game on windows you should have the windows version of the server, which I think you can run with wine on linux <[newline]> if you have installed the game on linux you should have the linux version of the server
MS#5409: Although i haven't found a way to get it to start on linux (server software)
MS#5409: Oh ok <[newline]> I did see some steam related files tho
totobono4#5551: Basically everything seams to be here.
totobono4#5551: https://logicworld.net/view/pst-44f2a22f/server-hosting-tutorial
totobono4#5551: Is there a linux version for the server ?
Stenodyon#8192: You don't need steam to run the server, you can copy the Server and GameData folders from the game folder (there's a button to get to that folder on the main menu) elsewhere and run Server (or Server.exe I think on windows)
MS#5409: I was planning on using an (little bit old) pc the server
MS#5409: i was planning on making a dedicated LW server but that requires me to have the game run run without steam... are there any options?
totobono4#5551: I almost died
Dragon Lord#6944: ```cpp <[newline]> void game(bool input) <[newline]> { <[newline]>   //do nothing - no logic here! <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
Verlio_H#0201: unlogical void the game
CrispyPin#1149: logic void the game
totobono4#5551: logic gates with no world
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: gate world with no logic
Limón#7879: logic world with no gates
Dragon Lord#6944: Well yes, but I suppose the gates are also what give it all of its upsides too...
totobono4#5551: Because of the gates ?
totobono4#5551: Mh yeah
Dragon Lord#6944: welp, mi tawa lape. o pona!
Dragon Lord#6944: the main downside of this design is that you have to wait 2 additional tick between counts for each bit of output. for 2 bits, it's 4 ticks before the internal state stabilises, for 3 bits it's 6 ticks, etc.
Blockmaster100#9931: thanks, ill try it out in a minute
Dragon Lord#6944: top line is the 'running total' and the bottom line is the clock
Dragon Lord#6944: here's the counter I was messing with. takes short pulses (i think i use 2 tick pulses here, but it works best with 1 tick pulses)
totobono4#5551: And the map crashed 'cause I tried to copy 16x16 cellars..
totobono4#5551: But its slow
totobono4#5551: I made a counter this weekend in my game of life in <#901195561980543007> , because I wont deal with conditions
Blockmaster100#9931: k ty
Dragon Lord#6944: 1 sec
Blockmaster100#9931: aight
Dragon Lord#6944: not handy...
Blockmaster100#9931: Do you happen to have a screenshot of one of them?
Dragon Lord#6944: then got bored and made a display
Dragon Lord#6944: was actually toying around with different counter designs earlier today lol
totobono4#5551: Oh thx
Dragon Lord#6944: you can reduce the ripple time by keeping a 'running total' of whether every previous bit is a 1, and a synchronous clock pulse. that way you don't have to wait as long for the signal to ripple through the counter :)
Blockmaster100#9931: What would that look like?
totobono4#5551: You can impulse in D latches and count in binary, update the next bit with a falling edge detector on the previous 🤔
Blockmaster100#9931: How would i go about making a counter?
Siggy#1321: thank you so much
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you can also do it with pegs
HomelikeBrick42#1173: hold down control
Siggy#1321: how do you place the small sockets close together like this?
Satan#9850: yes
Michael#8718: Being able to save specific boards will be really great
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: For sure
Ecconia#4929: Oh and if you get it running, feel free to update us with the details on this server. I am sure many are interested (quite the technical community)
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Thanks!
Ecconia#4929: I think Jimmy mentioned something like `Minecraft Realms` (pay to get the server hosted for you), but basically even all MC servers are initialized by organizations or individual players. <[newline]> The server software is already available, so you could just try to get it running on your Raspberry Pi 🙂
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Nice. One last question: will there be public servers not hosted by players? And can I make one using a Raspberry Pi or something like that?
Ecconia#4929: This feature was already a thing in the beta. But due to a recent improvement of code, this part sadly had to be removed for Early Access. <[newline]> It will be re-added once the developers finished their vacation. 🙂 <[newline]> (In Version: 0.91 or so)
𝔗𝔥𝔲𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔯#2420: Hey, I've just buy Logic World and I'm starting to build things and I realised that there is no way to save independent parts to use in other words. I think it could be a good idea. I don't know if it's already suggested
GHXX#9078: ish, you can tp a certain distance into the direction you are facing
circuitgamer77#0377: Are relative coordinates possible in a teleport?  I don't really have a use for them, but I'm curious.
C4io#2688: Ty
HomelikeBrick42#1173: or you can do `tp 0 0 0`
Ecconia#4929: open console, type "noclip".
HomelikeBrick42#1173: `noclip`
C4io#2688: I went inside a circuit board and get teleported for under the ground. how do i go up? I didn't put any flags to teleport.
circuitgamer77#0377: I was confused by that too at first :)
Siggy#1321: i wrongly assumed landing toggled flying off
Siggy#1321: yep just realized
circuitgamer77#0377: Are you flying?
Siggy#1321: the one that works was an imported world
Siggy#1321: why can i crouch in one of my worlds but not the other?
ThePiGuy24#0369: inclusive OR, treats every input equally, either high or low
Limón#7879: XNXOR
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: always 0
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: exclusive XOR
Limón#7879: inclusive buffer
GHXX#9078: a gate always outputting YES aka HI
GHXX#9078: ^ thats what i actually thought it was originally
Ecconia#4929: My favorite YES gate is the inverter with no wires at input.
GHXX#9078: yeah
CrispyPin#1149: truth table: 1
CrispyPin#1149: yes gate sounds more like (A or !A)
totobono4#5551: Yes
GHXX#9078: <:yee:845716540519219250> gate
Verlio_H#0201: Yes gate is the best gate
GHXX#9078: aka a diode
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Yes gate lol
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ahh thanks
Ecconia#4929: Turn down your simulation speed to 1 to 4 ticks. Your circuit is not fully synchronized. At slow speed you might more easily find the issue.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: just added a layer of memory as a buffer and problem is gone
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ???
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: no power
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: one of my circuits seems to flicker sometimes, any idea what could cause this?
totobono4#5551: Thanks
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: yes
totobono4#5551: This is the same thing.
totobono4#5551: So there is a yes gate, but the name is buffer x)
totobono4#5551: 
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: yess
totobono4#5551: Buffer is Yes gate btw
totobono4#5551: Oh yes it is
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: then rename it to the maybe gate
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: ow
totobono4#5551: This is not the same thing I guess
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: suggestion to rename the buffers to yes gate
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: yes
totobono4#5551: This allow the current to go in only one way.
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: how is the yes gate useful
totobono4#5551: Yes but this is usefull
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: if yes -> yes
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: i now need to know what a yes gate does
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: Sad
totobono4#5551: Yes, I was searching for but there is no yes gate
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: yes gates sound cool tho
totobono4#5551: Yes, thank you
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: buffers
totobono4#5551: Or a one way peg
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: ?
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: what
totobono4#5551: Is there a yes gate ?
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: i see now
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: ooh
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ^
Limón#7879: they are placed against a board
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: Whats up with ur weird relay rotations btw
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: since all the other outputs have that too
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: The carry out needed a delay too ofc
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: im stupid lol
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: I found the problem
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: oki
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't remember the exact position - I may have gotten that wrong.  Adding a fast buffer is definetly what fixed it for me though.  Maybe just mess around with the location for a bit :)
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: hm the overlap still seems to happen
circuitgamer77#0377: That looks right - I can't verify it right now because I'm on my laptop, but it looks right to me.
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: like this?
circuitgamer77#0377: Immediately following as in the signal out of the and gate should not ever reach the relay in the same adder - otherwise it does not fix it.
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: hm ok
circuitgamer77#0377: The overlap is because you don't have a buffer on the carry - I saw the same thing with mine.  Just add a fast buffer immediately following the relay on each adder.
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: or is this that 1 tick thingy
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: kinda weird
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: 
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: only weird thing is sometimes 2 outputs overlap idk how to explain it
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: this seems to work it seems to be synced sorta
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: like this
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if you want to sync it tho, keep in mind the relay takes 1 tick to switch
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: pog
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: looks correct :)
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: so like this?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Yea it's a relay
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: oh
Reese4221#8317: relay?
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: whats this
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hope this helps
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: oki
Reese4221#8317: a fast one not a slow one or else its just the same thing but bigger
Reese4221#8317: also a buffer so stuff cant flow back weirdly
Reese4221#8317: use a relay instead of a AND gate for the second AND gate
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: how does an instant carry adder work and what does it look like?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i guess in LW im dumb cuz you can just use AND gates, im still thinking in terms of MC xD <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> input[n] xor (input[0] * ... input[n-1] *  Enable) <[newline]> ```
Biggycheese69420#4947: no
Daimh#5870: Is there a way in the secret settings to change maximum board size?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it stops at n-1
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: took me a minute to figure that out but yea!
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah exactly lmao
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: So. !input[n] xor (!input[0] | ... !input[n-1] | ! Enable)?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the same as the video i linked above in Digital, justy instead of going into TFFs it goes into XORs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its a carry tower
circuitgamer77#0377: chaining half adders can be super fast, just make it instant-carry.  That's what I'm using for my 1 tick CPU program counter.
Artin_#3197: ok i did the f̷̌͑e̶̓̈ẃ̵̓b̷͑̄j̶̔͒h̷͗͑z̸̾́ũ̴̈́c̷̓̑v̴̏̎l̸̎͂q̸͊̅ and it works now
Artin_#3197: and big
Sekoia#3968: slower, though, no?
Limón#7879: chaining half adders can also work
Sekoia#3968: wdym it's simple you just f̷̌͑e̶̓̈ẃ̵̓b̷͑̄j̶̔͒h̷͗͑z̸̾́ũ̴̈́c̷̓̑v̴̏̎l̸̎͂q̸͊̅ and then you're done
Artin_#3197: this wiring confuses the shit out of me
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no registers needed eeither. whatever is on the input passes to the output, and when you enable +1 it gets incremented
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no relays needed
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: incrementer
blane1257#8086: since the B input never changes, you can actually jsut design the circuit to imply a certain B input without it actually existing
blane1257#8086: its kind of hard to explain how to do it correctly but you dont need all the circuitry to consider a second B input
blane1257#8086: but also, an approach im somewhat fond of is actually using half adders rather than full adders
blane1257#8086: you can use a chain of t flip-flops as a counter/incrementor
Artin_#3197: any way to just add 1 to a value without making an adder
Verlio_H#0201: nice 1t toggle clock design
Deleted User#0000: When I make comparisons like that, it is mostly meant metaphorically.
Deleted User#0000: idk
Sekoia#3968: have it so it only keeps flipping if the button is *not* pressed, then only output if the button and the output is pressed
Sekoia#3968: oh wait no it would be stable
Sekoia#3968: but then it wouldn't be stable.. idk
Sekoia#3968: add a not before it, and an and at the end
Sekoia#3968: true, you'd need some kind of weird flip
Deleted User#0000: The length of the pulse actually determines chance, i guess.
Sekoia#3968: definitely not an oracle tho
Sekoia#3968: nah it'll just keep flipping
CuberZNL#4235: Otherwise it will flip again
Sekoia#3968: so it's just a flip-flop
CuberZNL#4235: Only if you press the button for 1 tick
Sekoia#3968: then when the button is pressed, it flips again
Sekoia#3968: it's stable again, until the button is pressed
Sekoia#3968: then the button is pressed, the XOR outputs 0, so the memory becomes 0.
CuberZNL#4235: When you press it turns off but the input button if it’s still on it will go on again so it will create a clock
Sekoia#3968: let's start in the current situation: it's stable rn, so until the button is pressed, nothing happens
CuberZNL#4235: Or I’m dumb lemme think
CuberZNL#4235: I least I think so
Sekoia#3968: what, why?
CuberZNL#4235: Only when you click it just right so that’s why you would use a 1tick generator to use it
Sekoia#3968: doesn't that just... toggle?
CuberZNL#4235: It’s pretty cool what they can do ye
Deleted User#0000: I guess i found the Father of the Oracle.
Deleted User#0000: I would have had a hard time connecting the output of an xor with the input in order to generate a change of state with an impulse. That is simplicity at its most beautiful.
HomelikeBrick42#1173: like they will output whether the inputs are not-equal
HomelikeBrick42#1173: xor gates for some reason have alot of interesting uses
Deleted User#0000: The idea of using a xor gate like this is mind blowing for me.
Deleted User#0000: Oh okay, cool.
HomelikeBrick42#1173: probably youtube somewhere <[newline]> just watching scrap mechanic videos
Deleted User#0000: So where did you learned it? In school?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: it was just something i used to make in scrap mechanic 🤷
Deleted User#0000: Btw. interesting game
Deleted User#0000: So you got the idea from the game scrap mechanics?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: and i just recreated that in logic world
HomelikeBrick42#1173: and if you give it a 1 tick pulse it toggles its state
HomelikeBrick42#1173: when i used to play scrap mechanic that is how you would make small 1 tick clocks <[newline]> you could blueprint edit (it requires editing save files) an xor gate to connect to itself so then it would act as a clock when powered
Deleted User#0000: where did you get that idea?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: i dont think i created that design
HomelikeBrick42#1173: well i built it and took that image
Deleted User#0000: Did you create it?
Deleted User#0000: Thanks, this is awesome!
HomelikeBrick42#1173: 
Deleted User#0000: I want to make a simple button to switch states. Anyone some ideas?
Limón#7879: yeah
HomelikeBrick42#1173: it looks almost identical to logic world
Limón#7879: they're playing tung
HomelikeBrick42#1173: <@!267108295502725121> how did you get that world? <[newline]> https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/920816533440196628
circuitgamer77#0377: Those last two could be in either order.
circuitgamer77#0377: So for 5 ticks from 1, I would use one module with a buffer, then one module with a 2 tick delayer, then one with a buffer again.
circuitgamer77#0377: You can extend a pulse with one fast buffer and one normal buffer or delayer, with the delayer/buffer being set at max to the length of the input pulse.  That lets you chain that module and possibly shrink it a bit.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: its a good idea too
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ahhh thanks!
BigMintyMitch#1620: Yes or a buffer
BigMintyMitch#1620: I forgot those also take a tick
Verlio_H#0201: you can also use a buffer instead
BigMintyMitch#1620: The 30 second delayer over there was just to make a timer so I could test this to make sure it works, since that will output a 1 every 30 ticks or whatever
BigMintyMitch#1620: I took the minecraft approach and did something like this. Since I know it takes 1 tick to evaluate an AND gate, something like this will take the 1 tick and turn it into 5, or how many ever and gates there are. It isn't pretty tho, especially in large quantities
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: still slightly annoying though as it makes delaying 1tick pulses very tedious
circuitgamer77#0377: It does delay a signal, it just doesn't let you delay a signal shorter than the delay length.
circuitgamer77#0377: They let the signal through with that delay, but with no hidden states.  If they let any length through, there would be no way to see it's internal state.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: also is it just me or do the current 'delayers' not really do what they say they do given they dont delay a pulse but will only let a pulse that is the same length or larger than the delay through
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: How can i make say a 1 tick signal last 5 ticks?
Biggycheese69420#4947: Logic World FAQ: https://logicworld.net/view/pst-c032a587/logic-world-faq
Biggycheese69420#4947: but you can change it with console commands
Artin_#3197: ok
Biggycheese69420#4947: 30 tps
Artin_#3197: how many ticks in a second?
Lualt#0001: hmm alright let me try something thanks
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then your mux control signal tells it to shift or not
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and on the other one you perform a shift
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and on the output of one you pass the input with no shift
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you basically need a demultiplexor
Lualt#0001: yes but like i have tried alot and cant get it to work
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: use relays or and gates
Lualt#0001: how can a shift a signal to the left and to the right heres an image to see what i mean from right to left
borges#7777: hope this helps
borges#7777: since that's a whole lot less logic than decoding addresses, it'll stabilize much faster. you'll still get a few nanoseconds of garbage on serial reads and writes to the same address because the address-compare logic ain't instant either, but it can improve throughput greatly while still meeting your "simultaneous read outputs old value" requirement
borges#7777: much like forwarding on pipelined processors
borges#7777: _but what if I write an address and read it on the next cycle -- won't I "catch" the block being written to and get garbage?_ <[newline]>  <[newline]> yeah, so this is where you play dirty. see, the input pipeline is way "outside" of the whole address decoding stuff. you got a word and an address right there, and they are all nice and stable with the data you need. <[newline]>  <[newline]> so instead of waiting 'til the data propagates into the memory modules, you take the shortcut and output from the input pipeline instead
borges#7777: instead of writing the data right there and then, you hold it for one cycle, and _then_ you pass it on to the memory blocks. this way, when you read and write the same address, you'll get the "old" value, but the next read will get the right one
borges#7777: if you really wanna wire the memory blocks "directly" to the output and are using the same clock for both reading and writing, you could pipeline inputs instead
borges#7777: but if done right, those can actually increase throughput when read and write clocks differ
borges#7777: those make output more predictable in dual-port memory modules, but yes, as you pointed out, you'll have to account for the delay introduced by the register pipeline
borges#7777: firstly, your solution isn't inefficient -- it's widely-used and well-known, usually by the name of "registered output ports"
borges#7777: while you're right that data shouldn't change during the clock cycle, I don't think there's a "right" answer, it depends on what you expect out of the ram module
Nik#1011: <@538770131359236105>
Nik#1011: you can put a lil 1x1 board on its side tho and put the peg on that, maybe.

RIVAL | Quent#0001: I have the edge detectors for tick and tock, was just more curious if there was a way to handle the tick and tock signals differently that would stabilize faster and delay the actual data change until the next cycle so that you can save + load at the same time
Ecconia#4929: While you do have a clock that goes high and low for equal parts. <[newline]> You can only look at the edge of the signal. Means when the clock signal turns on or off. <[newline]> And one can then only consider one edge. When that edge happens, a 1-tick pulse can be sent to the PC (to jump to the next instruction) and to all memory units, to save the data. <[newline]> So once an instruction starts, the whole system does have some time to settle all data, and then after some time, it saves the stable state. <[newline]> But there are ofc other ways to deal with this.
Ecconia#4929: The main difference is that only the carry is instant. <[newline]> If you want the worst case just add  `11111111 + 1` which will ripple through each unit. For ICA that is about 3 ticks, for RCA about 11 ticks. <[newline]> Set your simulation speed to 5 or so, to see the difference properly.
RIVAL | Quent#0001: How do most people handle clocks when working with things like RAM? Specifically when loading + saving simultaneously. My intuition says that the output of the RAM shouldn't change throughout the clock cycle, but if we're saving at some point during the clock cycle (on 'tock' probably makes sense?) then that value could update while other components are reading it and end up with garbage data. <[newline]>  <[newline]> My solution to this was to add an additional 8-bit output buffer that locks the data from tick during tock, and unlocks again during tick. Basically "freezing" the value the RAM was outputting when tock came around. This feels inefficient though, and there's some timing delay that I need to hardcode into the system since it takes some time to decode the address and pull the value from storage. Is there another way to organize the clock cycle or the ram module that is more stable and not quite as slow?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: hmmm now that i look at it again i think i was just being dumb whilst i build it
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: For some reason my instant carry adder is just as fast as my normal adder? I dont really understand how it works but maybe its just too small to really have any effect... (only 8bits?)
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: or use winget

[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: windows terminal
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: yes w
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: windows has a new terminal emulator that is better i think
Ecconia#4929: It might work to use another console besides  `cmd` but that is just a wild guess of mine. <[newline]> Powershell for example *shrug* <[newline]> Or `Windows Terminal` (afaik must be downloaded via store)
DADp#7461: i think steam has some parans than just running it from console

Ecconia#4929: Probably with 0.91, I hope...
GHXX#9078: yepp, but i opened a ticket for that so hopefully that gets fixed soon
Ecconia#4929: However to my knowledge, you have to do this on every LW start, since the "commands to run at startup" has a problem with command bindings.
Ecconia#4929: For builtin commands just run `help` in console. <[newline]> Here you see the commands to add commands... <[newline]> To bind `noclip` to a key use: `commandbindings.add L "noclip"`
Ecconia#4929: Yes there is... <[newline]> But I would not bind V, unless the key is unbound. <[newline]> If you want to have noclip on whenever you are flying. <[newline]> There is a super secret setting to have that. But then you also need a fixed DLL, which you can get somewhere here: <https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/918113977693769728/918141688160092201>
circuitgamer77#0377: Not that I know of, but I wish there was.
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: i want to bind noclip toggle to v, in source i would do `bind v noclip` is there a similar thing i could do?
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: is there a way to bind a console command to a key
Leonski#3180: coolio, thanks
Limón#7879: yes
Leonski#3180: i'm working on a tool to help with modding, is it okay to post a link to it in <#901659878869844048> once it's ready-enough? (asking just in case)
Limón#7879: minecraft
CrispyPin#1149: worlds are stored in the saves folder
John Freedman(ЛжеДмитрий)#0318: What is the name of the server map in the game folder, where to look?
Theix#5229: yw
John Freedman(ЛжеДмитрий)#0318: ty)
Theix#5229: https://logicworld.net/view/pst-44f2a22f/server-hosting-tutorial
John Freedman(ЛжеДмитрий)#0318: How to do it?
Biggycheese69420#4947: it uses dedicated servers only so you have to make your own server to join
John Freedman(ЛжеДмитрий)#0318: Hello everyone! Can you tell me if I can play with a friend through Steam or VPN. I can't connect.
Dragon Lord#6944: Fast vs thin peg
Limón#7879: dwd
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: Hm i dont really get it still ill just use the fast buffer thingy
Limón#7879: very useful feature for decoders
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: ooh
CrispyPin#1149: meaning you don't get backflow between multiple things connected to the same output
CrispyPin#1149: an output peg can only be activated by the gate it's on, not by connected wires
Limón#7879: to signals going out
Limón#7879: a output acts a buffer
⛄gravitowl⛄#0001: What do you mean with "a signal can't flow back to it"?
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: yes but they werent asking for delay, just diode and fast buffer works exactly like a diode
CrispyPin#1149: note that output pegs (the fat ones) act sort of as diodes too, a signal can't flow back to it
Verlio_H#0201: fast buffer is instant other buffer is 1 tick
Verlio_H#0201: buffer in general
Ralper#4755: tnx
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: fast buffer
Ralper#4755: Which of the blocks is equivalent to the diode? I am making a driver for a 7 segment display and i need those to simplify the circuit
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: thank you
RyanT#1426: opps
RyanT#1426: oh...
drawcoco#9558: already in my message 😅
RyanT#1426: also pegs
drawcoco#9558: also works for pegs and circuit boards... and probably more
drawcoco#9558: using ctrl 😉
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: how are these placed so close together?
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: which is the same as a peg p much so they were right
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: it works but you can end up with problems like this
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: i dont think you need two fast buffers you should only need one
AX03#5549: thanks
Sekoia#3968: because connect both inputs to the peg, and you have an or gate
Sekoia#3968: if you're okay with it being two way: a single peg is an or gate
Sekoia#3968: if you need it to be a single way: two fast buffers connected to a peg
AX03#5549: How can you make an or gate in the game ?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think I heard of a tool someone made that can read save files and do that (kind of), but I don't remember if it's functional or how to find it.
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: thank you, is there any other way i can move a board to another world?
circuitgamer77#0377: Saving boards is not yet fully implemented.  Soon, hopefully?
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: are the `boards.save` commands broken? or am i just using them wrong? i ran `> boards.saveSUCC "foo" "bar"` while looking at a board i wanted to copy and it said `An exception occurred while executing the command: The method or operation is not implemented.` am i using it wrong or is it actually unimplimented ?
Sekoia#3968: see here actually.
Sekoia#3968: make a new grid world and check, idk off the top of my head
RIVAL | Quent#0001: I see... What is the WorldTypeID for the grid world?
Sekoia#3968: you need to go in the save file but yes
RIVAL | Quent#0001: Is it possible to change my world from grass world to the grid world?
Sekoia#3968: iirc sockets cause no simulation lag, because the graph is cached; they work like wires
Sekoia#3968: yeah, that's just partcount
blane1257#8086: careful not to overuse them tho; ive heard if you use hundreds and hundreds of them performance gets pretty bad with copying and stuff, though that might just be partcount in general
Sekoia#3968: (two blue socket faces touching eachother communicates exactly like a wire)
Sekoia#3968: you can fit three small sockets into a cell with modifier too
Sekoia#3968: sockets are also very useful for inter-board communication
Sekoia#3968: yup, the through peg
Ralper#4755: found it! \:D
Ralper#4755: And is there a way to make a signal pass though a circuit board?
Ralper#4755: ok, tnx
Sekoia#3968: (mod being modifier, I think ctrl by default?)
Sekoia#3968: you can clone a circuit board with mod+g though
Sekoia#3968: no, not yet sadly :(
Ralper#4755: Hello! Is there blueprints in the game?
WhyNot?#2534: use a fast buffer in parallel with a buffer, and then to lengthen it further you can use a fast buffer in parallel with a delayer set to the same pulse as the input
berry#1313: what's a good way to lengthen pulses?
Ecconia#4929: Public servers can be found here: <#905378240338726942> <[newline]> To create a server, you have to look for "tools" in your steam library and install "Logic World Dedicated Server". (Google if you do not find tools). <[newline]> Steam has a function to open the folder of the server, use it. You can then change the `config.succ` file to adjust the server. <[newline]> Now its just starting it (via Steam). <[newline]> You can copy the whole server folder, to run it somewhere else. But then there are a few setup things to consider.
Alxrooo#5693: How do i create/find a Multiplayer server?
zplilpz#9574: james sharman has like a two-year series on designing and building a pipelined cpu from logic gates on youtube. Might be a bit long form to learn directly, but might have good info if you need to look at specific parts
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Instruction fetch, decode / execute, memory/ writeback
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: I'd suggest a 3 stage pipeline
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Pick an ISA that was designed around pipelining (my choice is MIPS/RISCV)
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Now that I've made a Von Neuman CISC. I wanna try pipelining, but what I've looked up is rather overwhelming. Anyone have any design specification or limitation suggestions for an entry level pipelined computer? I've already decided to go with strictly Harvard to avoid dealing with a cache.
Eyez#3542: Ok i try to reinstall cause i use lan and have a good network connection
Deleted User#0000: I get this when I'm not connected to the internet or have a slow connection.
Eyez#3542: Im trying to play logic world but when i press start game im stuck in the loading screen
Rotstein_Meister#9051: And on my firewall too
Rotstein_Meister#9051: Ok now I can join but my friend can't. What to do? I opened the correct port on my fritz!box
Rotstein_Meister#9051: Im trying to play Logic world with a friend on a server. I host it on my pc. I have made the port open on my router, but Me and Him can't connect to the server. What can I do?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i made this at work yesterday for a test bench
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this is what an IRL relay circuit could possibly look like
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: xnor becuase i needed the relay in the inverse state
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: that square is the coil
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: a relay IRL has a coil and then the contact. current thru the coil creates a magnetic field that pulls the armature of the relay
Limón#7879: also why xnor
Limón#7879: is the relay the rectangle
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <:happi:675895879504494605>
berry#1313: thank you so much!
berry#1313: huhhhh that's super helpful!
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: that switch is a relay in game
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: do you see how from CIN to COUT there is no gate, but there is a switch that is open or closed
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: here is a logic diagram of an ICA
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: aka therre is no gate delay from CIN to COUT
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: just the carry
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the adder isnt instant
berry#1313: how do instant carry adders work?
Sekoia#3968: I've been using XORs
Sekoia#3968: ohhhh and gates, smart
cabral#9547: thanks!
Ecconia#4929: 
cabral#9547: oh, i just put a delay and it worked! :)
cabral#9547: i made a toggle latch, but if i keep pressing it, it will turn into a clock
cabral#9547: is there a way of sending a 1-tick pulse?
parallacks#7542: Nand2Tetris
Olyve#3775: I’ve looked at this site before and downloaded the software to get started but I’ve had problems getting it to work
parallacks#7542: I know I'm a bit late but I'm a big proponent of https://www.nand2tetris.org/ Especially if you've got a software engineer background. It takes you from logic gates to building an OS on (virtual) hardware you build. I'm about half way through and I'm loving every second of it. There are some limitations that exist in game currently that limit a few things like the scale of RAM the project wants you to have but Jimmy has said they've got plans for optimizations that will allow more components in the future.
Ecconia#4929: Open game-console execute `noclip`
Limón#7879: cuddle
DADp#7461: please
DADp#7461: y res
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i would like that
RIVAL | Quent#0001: Can you turn off bobby collision in multiplayer?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: same^
mokou#7143: both complement each other perfectly
mokou#7143: i bought the game along with Turing Complete
OopsieDoopsie#0412: There're a lot of computer science papers published. Whenever I thought of some circuit, I could just find an article about it
RIVAL | Quent#0001: ty
RIVAL | Quent#0001: :)
RIVAL | Quent#0001: Ah, that's why it felt so.... random
Reese4221#8317: random output
RIVAL | Quent#0001: What does the oracle do?
Saltypretzel#0321: I think he said no a while back https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/709250971557036164
blane1257#8086: the dev
drawcoco#9558: who s jimmy 😅
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ask jimmy? i mean it seams reasonable to have a second relay with both outputs
drawcoco#9558: yeah if only... well then my alu is probably already at max speed then
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but right now, not possible with a NO relay
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hmm, if relays had 2 states, NO and NC then it might be possible
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i dont think thats the purpose of this game
drawcoco#9558: mhhh then how am I supposed to do an instant alu :/
alion02#1973: not possible
drawcoco#9558: hey, any solution for an instant xor gate? using the relays as and is easy, but I can't figure out a way to do the not gate
Sekoia#3968: it's wonderfully ironic that instant components are slower
CrispyPin#1149: instant components are around 30% slower according to jimmy, no clue how scientific that number is tho
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and use AND gates everwhere else
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: a good rule of thumb is to use relays where gate delay on the critical path needs to be lowest
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: haha
zplilpz#9574: Ahh that makes sense, i've a mix of relays or and gates depending on mostly whatever i felt like at the moment with no rhyme or reason 🙂
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so avoid use of fast diode or relays
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the "instant" layer is slow iirc
zplilpz#9574: since simulation speed can be set to anything, what most influences your max overall compute rate? More components changing in the same tick (i.e. 2-tick adder) or less components overall?
Olyve#3775: Not completely new, but never did much beyond simple truth tables and basic logic gates haha
WhyNot?#2534: ^ yes this. its a must
Limón#7879: also if you are completely new to digital logic you might want to look into boolean algebra
Olyve#3775: Excellent idea! I just found some circuit diagrams that I am looking forward to trying out 🙂 starting small
Limón#7879: so diagram of full adder for example
Limón#7879: what I did for learning stuff is, diagram of x on your preferred search engine then I go to images
WhyNot?#2534: my best recommendation is to start simple and start making adders and multiplexers and stuff just to get a feel for the games mechanics and then just build a library of boards you can basically slap together to make whatever. (what im doing XD) as for text references... i dont have any of those either unfortunately. if i need something i just look up the circuit design
circuitgamer77#0377: I like reading, I'm just not good at learning from it :)
Olyve#3775: no worries! I'm sure others might have suggestions too
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't have any good reading sources, sorry.  I've pretty much taught myself, so I'm lacking in reference knowledge.
Olyve#3775: Thanks! I'll check him out! Any books or articles? I'll def check out the videos but I do like reading about new topics when learning, just fits my style haha
circuitgamer77#0377: Ben Eater on YouTube is a great source to learn binary logic - almost everyone here has watched his videos :)
Olyve#3775: Hi all! I'm a software engineer and just recently got the game, but this kind of logic is not quite in my wheel house of knowledge. I would like to learn more though and wondered if any of you had suggestions for resources on where to learn about stuff I could then try building in the game. Thanks :)!
circuitgamer77#0377: This is the furthest apart I can get them:
sparks#0687: yeah but they're not aligned
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know how wide, I can't see a gap at all
sparks#0687: interesting
sparks#0687: oh wow, pretty wide tolerance
circuitgamer77#0377: Yep, possible!
sparks#0687: depends on how much tolerance the pegs are using I guess
sparks#0687: I think I'll stick to gridclands
circuitgamer77#0377: Can you place things that perfectly by hand?
sparks#0687: so if you put things just perfectly adjacent in a grass lands it'll hook up...
circuitgamer77#0377: Yep, works!
sparks#0687: I'm going to guess yes
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm trying it now :)
sparks#0687: thanks for the help!
sparks#0687: not sure, maybe I'll try that later
circuitgamer77#0377: If you build something that connects with sockets in Gridlands, then convert it to Grasslands, do the sockets still connect?
RyanT#1426: oh
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: fine rotation
sparks#0687: just built it in grasslands and then edit to gridlands!
RyanT#1426: HOW?????@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sparks#0687: the RAM is ok! 😄
sparks#0687: 
RyanT#1426: WAT????!!!!
circuitgamer77#0377: I agree with your assessment :)
circuitgamer77#0377: My test worked too :)
sparks#0687: heh, this is cursed
sparks#0687: I needed to completely quit the game
sparks#0687: oh! worked on the second try
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm going to try it to see if it works with the most recent update.
sparks#0687: hmm not sure if I did it right but still grass, trying again (from the backup!)
circuitgamer77#0377: Definitely backup :)
Saltypretzel#0321: might be a good idea to backup first
circuitgamer77#0377: In that you can edit the hex for each color
circuitgamer77#0377: The second file should be in ExtraData - MHG.WorldTypeData.succ
circuitgamer77#0377: After you load the world, it should create a second file that lets you change the grid colors
circuitgamer77#0377: On the first line, change MHG.Grasslands to MHG.Gridlands
circuitgamer77#0377: I need to find the text to edit...
circuitgamer77#0377: worldinfo.succ
sparks#0687: awesome! was not looking forward to rebuilding the RAM or something...
circuitgamer77#0377: worlds
circuitgamer77#0377: I did that to one of my old workd
circuitgamer77#0377: Let me find the file again
sparks#0687: ooh! That's in the save somewhere?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think you can change the worldtype file, you would just have to reposition components to align with the grid
sparks#0687: is there any way to change a grass world to a grid world? I built 256 bytes of RAM in a grass world but I think it'll be easier to work on other components and link them together in a grid world
Cimos#2927: ko
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ok
Ecconia#4929: Yes, sounds more like rambling, but if one knows what you mean it can be understood. <[newline]> (He is explaining why one adder is enough - it's just a bit messy).
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this conveniently leaves you with the following inputs on the adder <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> cin, 1, 1, 2, 4 <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> which if  you add them up is just enough to input any value from 0 to 9
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: then bus the output back to the input with a 1 left shift and 3 left shifts
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: on the output of the adder you latch the result
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for a sequential one, you only need 1 adder
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah i guess i should specify
Ecconia#4929: No, that is not what I said. ||It is not exactly correct either.|| <[newline]> Cause I did not imply if the algorithm is executed sequentially or not. <[newline]> Both ways are possible and perfectly valid. <[newline]> However the amount of adders can change from a single one, or two for looping. <[newline]> For non-sequential you would need about 4 adders. <[newline]> Was a pleasure to teach you. 🙂
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: As ecconia said. You just need a single adder.
cos#8062: yeah, i did a thorough test after noticing it screw up once and realized you would have to turn it into an actual cca to fix it.
Ecconia#4929: Oh damn discord messed with my formattings, second... <[newline]> Okay updated it a bit.
MEE1000000#6821: thanks
Ecconia#4929: Yes. You can convert the number, using a simple algorithm. <[newline]> - You convert each digit to a binary number (0 to 9). <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> 0 = b000; 1 = b0001; 8 = b1000; 9 = b1001 <[newline]> ```- You take the hundreds and multiply it by 10\*. <[newline]> - You add the tens and multiply the result by 10\*. <[newline]> - You add the ones. <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> binary = (((hundreds) * 10 + tens) * 10 + ones) <[newline]> ```\*To "multiply a number by 10" you can use a simple addition: <[newline]> - The binary number 10 is `1010`, that is only two bits set. <[newline]> - So you shift the number to multiply by 10, once and three times, and add both. <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> b101010 = 42 <[newline]> Shift 1:   1010100 <[newline]> Shift 3: 101010000 <[newline]> Add:     110100100 <[newline]> 0b110100100 = 420 <[newline]> ```
Hugin#2596: Cuz I'm dumb and wrote it like 5 minutes after waking up lmao
Sekoia#3968: why is it in <#901199821212352573> then lol
Hugin#2596: Dude, I know <[newline]> This is just a dumb joke <[newline]> It is plain dumb to compare
MEE1000000#6821: just need to interface the inputs with the adder
MEE1000000#6821: this is where im at now
MEE1000000#6821: so, I'm converting between this and a 7bit binary number
MEE1000000#6821: are there any ways to efficiently convert between ones tens and hundreds switches, and a 7bit binary number?
Sekoia#3968: yep
CrispyPin#1149: mc also doesnt load the whole world at once lol
Sekoia#3968: minecraft uses a different structure for loading, LW needs to load and construct graphs etc. As well, minecraft has more data to store in the first place, as every block needs to be stored. Third, LW is currently in Alpha, and Jimmy will be upgrading the loading in an update soon-ish
CrispyPin#1149: lower your render distance all the way before loading the world, this often helps with loading times
Hugin#2596: Lw: trouble loading 10mb <[newline]> Minecraft: gb with ease
zplilpz#9574: any way to change console colors? Having a hard time with dark red on dark gray
commander of the pandas#1576: no
commander of the pandas#1576: how
circuitgamer77#0377: Did you try the render distance trick?
commander of the pandas#1576: thank god the backups folder exists, I did get it to work but if your world just can't load when theres too many components on it then I can't finish this tetris
CrispyPin#1149: yeah i flew around a bit and even placed some components at the spawn
commander of the pandas#1576: It makes a new file for cadenjb, not sure who the other citizens are, the world actually loaded for a second. are you able to fly around when you do?
CrispyPin#1149: huh what if you delete them?
commander of the pandas#1576: still crashed, but now I have 4 differen't people in the players folder, 3 of which are me
CrispyPin#1149: this has been re-saved, probably wont make a difference but might be worth testing
CrispyPin#1149: oof
commander of the pandas#1576: I see the game, and then it crashes
CrispyPin#1149: idk its only using 2.5GB
CrispyPin#1149: beofore even starting to load?
commander of the pandas#1576: maybe I just need to dedicate more RAM to LW?
commander of the pandas#1576: every time I open it it crashes instantly
CrispyPin#1149: works fine just takes a while because 7mb
CrispyPin#1149: i can load it
commander of the pandas#1576: the reason why this is posted in questions is because im asking if theres a way I can load my world without crashing
commander of the pandas#1576: okay so this is actually a thing to convert my tetris piece renderer to color and then be able to save the color data on the screen and to also do line clears
Reese4221#8317: how much data does it store
Reese4221#8317: oh my goodness
commander of the pandas#1576: screenshot I took before my game crashed again
commander of the pandas#1576: 
commander of the pandas#1576: this is probably a lot easier to use
commander of the pandas#1576: 
commander of the pandas#1576: someone should download my world and see if they can open it
commander of the pandas#1576: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CEJDOEzVGW5Vb6vSTW63ce4Y5vzFRPe7?usp=sharing
Reese4221#8317: what did you do?!
commander of the pandas#1576: someone should try and load my world for me :P
commander of the pandas#1576: <@!369257250109259776> okay so my world got to 7 megabytes and I don't think I can load it
Saltypretzel#0321: How many undos can logic world do before it doesn’t remember
Ecconia#4929: Big fat optimised 1-tick decoder I assume. <[newline]> But the second XOR needs two prepared relays. <[newline]> So the carry must exist in OFF and ON version *shrug* you better ask the creator of that monstrocity.
Limón#7879: mmmm mspaint (also mmmm almost corrected to mommy)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: how do you subvert that?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: first xor and last xor is 2 ticks right there
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but still how 1 tick?
Ecconia#4929: Ahh yeah then it makes sense 🙂
commander of the pandas#1576: I use ICA as the general term for an adder that carry’s instantly instead of rippling, I did mean CLA
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: id assume 1000 wire connections are faster to simulate than a single instant diode? <a:KEKWgif:829851650717909094>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: which might be the ideal adder in LW
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but his is constant growth
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: because it would grow like n(log(n) in size complexity for each bit at the slightest
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah haha that was my conclusions when he posted it
Ecconia#4929: That looks like you only need one carry wire per bit <[newline]> -> Indeed not CLA
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: remember this adder you amde?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <@!326461320742567937>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/416276124977332226/684050005681504301
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: found it
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i really wish i could remember who made that cca here
101#1688: (poverty 7 ticks)
101#1688: Ladner fischer FTW
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so you can see for an 8 bit CCA, for all slab towers you have 8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 wires to run
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: are just compacting all those or gates and wires into a single thing
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the diode slabs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: this is why you need a bunch of wires
Ecconia#4929: Once you made one, lets debate again what it actually is 😛 I am looking forward
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i forget who it was, but someone in this disc made one back in LW beta, cuz we were debating on what kind of adder it was
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the CCA is linear instead of triangular
Ecconia#4929: The most crazy one 😄
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: CLA has a different fan out
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it isnt
Ecconia#4929: Be careful that it does not turn out to be a CLA then 😛
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you dont need SS for CCA :D
Ecconia#4929: Whatever a CCA is without SS.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the CCA logic just requires a shit ton™️ of wires
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i thihnk imma just make 8bit CCAs and then chain them together from cout to cin for a 32 bit adder, then ill resync
Ecconia#4929: ^Keep in mind, that you need to put more traditional adders in parallel, so that you have the same work-load. It is tricky 😄
101#1688: rate I'd be interested to see a max tick rate comparison between an ICA and some more traditional adders
Ecconia#4929: Jarvi, if something is slower than simulating instant diodes, then it is adding/removing wire-connections (even non physical ones). <[newline]> And the factor between these two is SIGNIFICANTLY huge. Hence relays are instant diodes and not actual wire-connections.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: maybe imma have to avoid relays too <:sadge:809028847999778836>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: either the net connection is there or isnt
Ecconia#4929: Yes.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: a relay should really be considered an open or closed wire
Ecconia#4929: Both relays and diodes use the same simulation mechanism. A relays is a two-way instant diode (if enabled).
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: im not sure why hed need the same approach
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: relays arent a diode
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: relays too?
Ecconia#4929: *relays and instant diodes <[newline]> But you are technically right, if you care for total simulation duration. Then no-instant is always faster. But if you do not care or just do not have a lot of simulation load, then its a perfectly valid approach.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: imma avoid all instant stuff xD
101#1688: Yeah
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so its gotta be slower
101#1688: <@!151293812675706880> Was it you?
101#1688: A sort of extra step in the simulation to avoid order dependent behaviour
101#1688: Someone was talking about how the instant stuff was simulated earlier, "the instant layer" was what it was referred to as I believe
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: i could very well be wrong tho
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and i would think you could clock a 3t adder faster in sim than a 1tick adder because im sure theres a speed penalty simulating a ton of instant diodes
101#1688: (don't quote me on that)
101#1688: Giant lookup tables I think
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: how yall doing 1 tick adders when you need half adder and last xor which are 2t right there
Ecconia#4929: 1-tick CLA has been built already with exponential size (by jetFEE42) - how would that work for ICA?
circuitgamer77#0377: My current design is 2 tick synced, but it is not optimised for size.  3 wide per adder, 1.5 tall, and quite long (I don't remember the exact length).
commander of the pandas#1576: One tick ICA is possible but it’s exponentially large I wouldn’t recommend it
commander of the pandas#1576: The only way I can think to do an instant one tick pulse generator is to take the inversion of the input going into the relay before some previous logic and then go to the relay
circuitgamer77#0377: My current design is 2 tick :)
commander of the pandas#1576: 2 wide tileable
commander of the pandas#1576: Jetfee has a good 2 tick ICA
circuitgamer77#0377: I could make a gigantic decoder using xors for every possible value and it's output, but that gets impossibly big for higher bit counts.
circuitgamer77#0377: instant carry, of course.
circuitgamer77#0377: What's the fastest tileable adder design currently?
circuitgamer77#0377: I can do 2 tick, but I would prefer 1 tick...
circuitgamer77#0377: Idea didn't work.  Any ideas?
circuitgamer77#0377: Wait - I think I have a solution.
circuitgamer77#0377: Actually was way easer than I initially thought.  Is there an instant 1 tick generator?
circuitgamer77#0377: Should I do with or without feedback protection?
circuitgamer77#0377: 1 tick write, 0 tick read?  I guess I can see how that would that work...  One moment, I kind of want to design that now.
CrispyPin#1149: why not 1,0?
circuitgamer77#0377: I would say 1, 1 in general, but 2, 0 might be good if it's used as an input register (like A and B for the ALU).  Implementation dependent, though
HomelikeBrick42#1173: what is generally more useful for a register: <[newline]> 2 tick write, 0 tick read <[newline]> 1 tick write, 1 tick read
DanielGJ44#4557: that or just join an existing server and teleport to a random spot
GHXX#9078: or, alternatively try hamachi or something similar, like in the old minecraft days 😛
GHXX#9078: and if you are not in the same network then you will need to forward some ports or configure some firewalls
GHXX#9078: well, if they are in another wifi then that means you arent in the same network
HomelikeBrick42#1173: how easy is it to play with someone that is on another wifi?
GHXX#9078: corresponding autoexec.lsf file (error messages change when modifying this file, so this should be the correct file thats being parsed)
GHXX#9078: 
GHXX#9078: Since someone has been asking in the past, i would like to repeat the question: <[newline]> Is it possible to call <[newline]> ```commandbindings.add "INSERT" "noclip true"``` and ```commandbindings.add "HOME" "teleportDirectional 100"``` <[newline]> via the autoexec.lsf file? It appears that the parser splits the command input by ".", treating "add" as an argument, which then means it cannot find the command
Ecconia#4929: It is most likely a framework issue. I am not sure how C# does it. Java by default listens to all interfaces.
GHXX#9078: im guessing it has to do with the way udp works, although the server could listen on all interfaces and simply reply via the interface it came from
Ecconia#4929: Would never dare to... 🙃 ||¿¿¿JIMMY WHY IS NETWORK SO WEIRD?????||
CrispyPin#1149: are you questioning the jimmy?
Ecconia#4929: Nice that you solve it. <[newline]> Yeah WiFi and LAN do have two different ips. I will add that to my "things to consider" for future helping. <[newline]> But why does LogicWorld care for which interface has the request... ....confused...
WhyNot?#2534: it didnt, was one of the first things i tried
jackson535#1361: I think a vpn would solve this too
WhyNot?#2534: *it was the way i had the port forward set up. an old issue with isp that i didnt know was resolved meant i could only port forward over wifi and not ethernet but the packets were coming via ethernet so i switched the port forward to the ethernet line and it worked
WhyNot?#2534: *we have determined that the port is open and the server is receiving requests and thats it, and it cant be connect via localhost either for some reason
WhyNot?#2534: aight
GHXX#9078: but we should post the conclusions so other people can build on that
GHXX#9078: maybe we should continue this talk in dms anyway so we dont spam here
WhyNot?#2534: ill dm it since it has your ip
WhyNot?#2534: oh something popped up in the console
WhyNot?#2534: i dont
GHXX#9078: process explorer for example
WhyNot?#2534: such as?
WhyNot?#2534: i always have the firewall turned off on that server so that my admins can remote in and start something up without worrying about the firewall butting in
GHXX#9078: do you happen to have a program installed to see which ports the LW server is listening on?
GHXX#9078: oh
GHXX#9078: you could attempt to turn that off for a minute and then try to connect again
WhyNot?#2534: firewall is completely disabled
WhyNot?#2534: up here
GHXX#9078: therefore the issue might be the windows firewall?
GHXX#9078: so now the question is whether the logicworld server is running and listening on that port, which it should if there are no errors in the console,
GHXX#9078: so your pc gets it meaning your router is fine
GHXX#9078: ok nice
WhyNot?#2534: i got it and i se it it looks the same as mine unless im just not seeing something
GHXX#9078: still timing out for me fyi
GHXX#9078: but timed out
GHXX#9078: just tried to connect again (would be great if you didnt share my ip btw)
GHXX#9078: well yeah tcp would get resetted as the port is not open
WhyNot?#2534: from when i attempt to connect in game
WhyNot?#2534: got this when using a port checker just now (i have both tcp and udp open)
WhyNot?#2534: i just noticed its wifi wasnt connected when you tried to join, but now its connected and wireshark is running
WhyNot?#2534: working on it
GHXX#9078: can you run wireshark on the pc that the lw server is running on, to see if any packets are received?
WhyNot?#2534: it is
GHXX#9078: are you sure port 43531 (udp) is forwarded in the router, and that the port is also opened in the server pc's firewall?
GHXX#9078: okay - tried connecting twice, its just timing out. An initial udp packet is sent from my pc to your server, but no reply is received
WhyNot?#2534: ok its up now, and its still running in ipv4 yes. ip is : mc.whatever.sbs (on the same system as the minecraft server hence the mc)
GHXX#9078: i play on my own server with a friend so it should work from my side, assuming you still have the network mode override set to ipv4 (i had to set that on my server too because my isp is lazy and doesnt offer ipv6 yet)
WhyNot?#2534: ill start it up
GHXX#9078: is the server running right now? i could give it a go in a bit
WhyNot?#2534: they cant, they also tried hamachi, but they also in college
GHXX#9078: but first id suggest asking your friends if they can connect <@342001099190042626>
GHXX#9078: if they do block the port just run the server on some other port
Limón#7879: logic world the network security risk
GHXX#9078: is your college possibly blocking the logicworld connections?
WhyNot?#2534: *i also tried connecting via hamachi and that didnt work
commander of the pandas#1576: with forums
commander of the pandas#1576: it has a website
commander of the pandas#1576: https://logicworld.net/
Darkhog#8724: Does this game have a wiki?
WhyNot?#2534: 
WhyNot?#2534: the router also has remote access fortunately
WhyNot?#2534: i thank you for the offer, hopefully i can get it sorted out before you come back online but i prob wont XD
Ecconia#4929: Then I can give you a customly written logic world client. Which can debug stuff for this situation. <[newline]> It's a Java program though. But that is for in 8 hours. Till then, if the problem is still up.
WhyNot?#2534: i should be up, i just woke up myself, and i do have remote access yes
Ecconia#4929: Sadly I should sleep now. In 8 hours I could continue helping. If you are still up by then. (2am here). <[newline]> Hmm, do you have remote access to that server/computer?
Ecconia#4929: That is good
WhyNot?#2534: im able to ping it and connect to the minecraft server it runs though
Ecconia#4929: That makes it a bit more complicated :P
WhyNot?#2534: my server is physically in another location so i dont, im in a college dorm so my server is at my mothers so i can port forward and my mother is to say as kindly as possible, not good with computers
Ecconia#4929: If yes, it must be the portforwarding. <[newline]> If no it must be the firewall. Or something worse
Ecconia#4929: Now I can only suggest means to debug your network. <[newline]> Like, can you connect to your server from another computer in your network?
WhyNot?#2534: The error is connection timeout indeed, and the router forwards both, it doesn’t have the option for one or the other and I did udp in the disabled firewall
Ecconia#4929: Hmm then I do not know any other possible issue. Your console output looks fine. <[newline]> What are the errors the clients receive? <[newline]> Connection timeout? (Cause then it might be a connection thing, broke portforwarding). <[newline]> Just to confirm, you forwarded: UDP port 43531 (Not TCP!)
WhyNot?#2534: I added the ports to the firewall after the initial failure to join, but my firewall is actually completely disabled Bc of how I run the server
circuitgamer77#0377: I mean...  Maybe?
blane1257#8086: smh
blane1257#8086: the shadow moves, doesnt it?
blane1257#8086: sure it is!
circuitgamer77#0377: Why is it in "Misc. Player Movement"?  It's not movement-related at all!
circuitgamer77#0377: Found it
circuitgamer77#0377: Where's the option to disable your own shadow again?  I turned it on, but now I can't find the setting to turn it back off...
Ecconia#4929: Often the firewall butts in. (Assuming windows) you can temporary turn it off, to see if it works then. To exclude it from the list of causes.
Gositi#4985: ok, thanks!
HomelikeBrick42#1173: `server "simulation.rate 30"`
Gositi#4985: can't find any in-game help on it.
Gositi#4985: I forgot how to change the the tick speed... I remember it was "server.<something>" but I forgot what that something part is
WhyNot?#2534: im having trouble getting a server up. ive port forwarded on both the router and server but im having no luck connecting. This is the same server i normally run my minecraft server on and it handles me and my friends just fine there so im not sure why im not able to connect to a logic world server. any ideas or suggestions on what to try would be greatly appreciated
tophangel#4416: I’ve reached a point with a grid of 10x10 ram modules where I can’t place more. Is there a way I can combine the board as in the final location they are at the same orientation?
101#1688: No actual limit, but you may encounter problems with too many.
tophangel#4416: is there a limit to the number of boards you can have supported by one board?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: for me its a mystery machine
OopsieDoopsie#0412: well i've made double dabble multiple times and i still can't understand shit about it
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you can use double dabble on fixed point btw
OopsieDoopsie#0412: well, f.e. i thought of 1111 as 3.75, i can store a bit that will tell my display to show value in FXPT 2.2. If bit is 0, that'll mean that i thought of 1111 as of 15, and so display will show value in INT
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <:Hmm:804642320195780619>
OopsieDoopsie#0412: well i can say that my display is a programmer in that case
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for instance 1111 can be 15 or 111.1 is 7.5 or 11.11 is 3.75 etc
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its on the programmer how to interpret the value
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no need
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: It makes it so you have to truncate some bits at particular spots
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: You need to keep the precision output the same as the input
Limón#7879: dividing is just repeated subtraction and multiplying is repeated addition
Limón#7879: I feel like it's not that different
OopsieDoopsie#0412: so can i store a flag that will determine if value is INT 1+7.0 or FXPT 1+3.4?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ||https://github.com/TheWildJarvi/JarviBrot||
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: which once you understand fixed point, you can start making cooler things, such as mandelbrot render units
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but i cover that in that video
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but you want the output to also be in the same fixed point notation as the input
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it changes because mults double the output bits
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for multipliers and dividers
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for adders yes
Limón#7879: normal binary addition*
Limón#7879: is it not normal addition
OopsieDoopsie#0412: oooooh thanks
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://youtu.be/E52PiRjJS1Y
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: But it will do fixed point
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: So no, a basic adder won't do floating point
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: To normalize the exponents
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: You need a barrel shfiter
OopsieDoopsie#0412: 
OopsieDoopsie#0412: Is IEEE 754 standart usable without instructions and stuff? Like, can RCA (with minimum readjustment) work with numbers written in IEEE 754
OopsieDoopsie#0412: sorry for repeating my question, but:
blane1257#8086: RISC vs CISC semantics
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and let a sys call handle the exception
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and throw an exception iof misaligned
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: just force alignement in code
101#1688: I think I'm just ignoring them at the moment, along with a bunch of other error signals...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: that ^ is built into digital in the custom components section
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: here:
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yup i have a logic diagram that halndels them
101#1688: And then you have misaligned accesses to think about 😬
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: reading a word loads 4 addresses at the same time to make up a 32bit word
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if your ram is byte addressed, and you have 32bit data
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if your data is 32 bits, and each ram address holds 32bits, then you only load one address at a time
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if ram is word addressed, then no
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: oof i replied to the wrong person
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: only in byte addresses memory
Keklord#1759: Thanks I'll keep that in mind
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ok!
Theix#5229: Alright, that'll be like 11pm here, but if I'm not too tired I'll probably join.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yea np, i get off work at 4pm est and ill be home by 5pm :D
Theix#5229: But anyway, thanks for the help I'll try to understand how it works, and if I'm completely lost I might join VC later with some questions.
Theix#5229: Yea that's what I gathered, I don't know where I got the 1 register from
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: it has nothing to do with the amount of local registers and has to do with where the operations sources its operands from, risc is in regs, cisc sources from ram
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: heres a schem of how i did my reg banks
Theix#5229: or rather 1 register set
Theix#5229: But I was also thinking about trying to make it a CISC computer, not that I'm very knowledgeable about the topic. But as I understand it, CISC only has 1 register right?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but the mult will return 2, 16bit words so you just need a dual write for some of your regs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if your alu is 16 bits then you only need 16 bit regs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah thats fine
Theix#5229: I mean I already have a 32bit register designed, or well it's two interlaced 16bit registers, but it's easily convertable to a 32bit register
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: those 16, 64bit registers are actually combined mLo and mHi registers
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in my latest CPU, I have 32, 32bit registers for integers, and i have 16, 64bit registers for multiplication results, for a total of 64, 32bit regs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: heres some more reading you can do: http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/273/12-notes.pdf
101#1688: If I were doing this, I'd take a microcoded approach, and have the results returned in two registers, or Jarvis solution if your decode/data path makes that awkward
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and then special instructions called move mlo and move mhi to copy them to your registers
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you can have 2 registers for the mult called mHi and mLo
drawcoco#9558: to make a multiplier, that s just a matter of timing, you have to execute additions while shifting the words by 1 every cycle (one side up, the other down) <[newline]> best is to check it out on internet
drawcoco#9558: you can just remove the 8 top bits of your input 😉
Theix#5229: I have made a 16-bit alu, and want to build a multiplier circuit, but I'm curious to how I should do it. Now a 16x16 multiplier circuit would give 32 outputs, so should I make an 8x8 multiplier circuit instead so I get 16 outputs?
blane1257#8086: another example would be a register file, used in some CPU architectures <[newline]>  <[newline]> it typically has 1 input bus and 2 output busses, all of which can be addressed individually and simultaniously, the point being that you could grab two values from the file, perform some operation on them, and store the result back in the file, all in a single step
blane1257#8086: as an example, theres something called dual-port ram which was used a lot in the early days of computer graphics, as a frame buffer that the CPU could write to simultanious to a video driver reading from it, eliminating timing/synchronization issues inherent to making both sides use the same port
blane1257#8086: you *can* do stuff like this,  by having multiple busses, if its necessary
Keklord#1759: I wish larger circuit board sizes were supported
Keklord#1759: just wanted to make sure nothing is garbage
Keklord#1759: I'm about to begin rebuilding my system as 16-bit
Keklord#1759: thats what i was thinking
OopsieDoopsie#0412: How would you access multiple addresses?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: And if you have 1 address bus
Keklord#1759: hmmm
OopsieDoopsie#0412: <@164535185084252161> if both addresses are connected to one data bus, i can't imagine that
OopsieDoopsie#0412: Is IEEE 754 standart usable without instructions and stuff? Like, can RCA (with minimum readjustment) work with numbers written in IEEE 754
Keklord#1759: Should more than 1 address of ram ever be accessed at the same time?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: oh wow i was making harvard architecture without knowing it has a name
Keklord#1759: but I will definitely look into those thank you
Keklord#1759: it's the implementation in pure logic gates that is more difficult for me
Keklord#1759: well I know some stuff, I even had to learn to code in MIPS 1 for a class
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Oh, <@!164535185084252161>. If you're new to computer architecture and want to build more of a full computer. I'd suggest looking up Harvard Architecture, and RISC. Especially Harvard Architecture. Most microcontrollers use it and it helps a decent bit with starting out. Von Neuman Architecture is the other side of the coin, it's how PC's work. And can be a bit of a hassle to grasp.
Water#1039: ok, sounds like jibberish right now but ill come back if i have any questions
OopsieDoopsie#0412: it's rather easy and might get you into that logic thing
OopsieDoopsie#0412: try building, for example, fibonacci counter
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Is a single prediction made. And if the prediction was incorrect some sort of redo is done?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: <@!336436121120538624> you need to make yourself a goal by yourself and try to build a circuit that'll do what you desired
Keklord#1759: Well my first project was making a machine to binary addition two different 16-bit signals. See if you can do that if it interests you. Or you can try 4 bit or 8 bit or something smaller
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: You lost me.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: A 2 bit branch predictor is a 2 bit up down saturation counter
Water#1039: not very, i havent done much with logic, just simple codeing classes
OopsieDoopsie#0412: there's so much to do
OopsieDoopsie#0412: untill we make logic world to run logic world
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: You have to stall or predict! :D
Keklord#1759: how experienced are you with logic
Water#1039: uh this may sound like a odd question but there isnt much to do? i dont know if im just not thinking out of the box but\
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Awesome. Now, I think I saw somewhere that in some cases, like GPU's, conditional branches are run in parallel for each condition and the correct result is selected once the condition is fully resolved. As an alternative(cause that's quite a bit for me to wrap my head around) is it acceptable to perform a long stall?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: And branching and yea haha
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Depends on the pipeline
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Ok, and as I understand it, stalls are largely used for conditionals and such where read and writes must be aligned to not interfere?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: but wouldn't you still need 2 clock cycles to write from RAM to reg?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Yes, this way you can stall the clock and not lose the data in the pipeline
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Woe. I read a bit of that pipelining link. I noticed it mentioned "pipeline registers." Is that a how a pipelined cpu can essentially separate the main bus so that instructions along the pipeline can function together?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: And plenty of andvanced cpus have several register banks for context swaps with mult writes and and reads lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: One clock cycle yea
OopsieDoopsie#0412: what's the point of double read? to do an ALU operation in one tick?
circuitgamer77#0377: (correction - increment program counter is the third step, then the instruction-dependent steps happen)
circuitgamer77#0377: Read, write, and increment program counter are all seperate steps.
circuitgamer77#0377: First is write the value in the program counter into the RAM address register, second is read the value from RAM into the instruction register (decoding is the same step), third and later are dependent on the instruction.
circuitgamer77#0377: (also, my CPU doesn't have a separate address bus, so it takes a few steps to get the next instruction from RAM)
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Hey Keklord. You made a ram, but no cpu. And you're trying to decide how big to make your cpu registers?
circuitgamer77#0377: My processor has each step as a clock cycle, but the clock runs as fast as I could make it.  It's a slower design overall, but expandable to more complicated instructions.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Never run into that issue
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Uhm, the easy way is split execution on the rising edge of the clock (advance PC, load instruction, execute) and on the falling edge do register write
circuitgamer77#0377: What I'm trying to explain is that for an instruction (this example is move register A to register B), there are several steps.  Example: First you have to put the value from A on the bus, then you have to read the value on the bus to B.  If you try to do those at the same time, there's no guarantee that the value in A will even be on the bus when B is written to, so B could just get junk data.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Well it is parelleliziing instructions, but not hardware so you're right lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: My apologies
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: But when you said split the instructions up, I assumed you meant pipelining
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: This isnt parellelizing
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: It increases thruput but also increases latency
circuitgamer77#0377: No, I'm not doing any kind of parallelizing - I'm just making each step a bit easier to see.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Breaking the instructions into discrete steps and using several cycles to execute an operation
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: This is pipelining: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Give me 10 sure
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Multicycle introduces so many hazards and stall conditions that exponentially inflate explaining this problem
Keklord#1759: also saying "stop" all the time is generally considered rude, just so you know
circuitgamer77#0377: Can we talk in VC?  I think it could be easier if we could stream examples/talk.
Keklord#1759: ima just build some shit and see what I can get working
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: No literally they teach single cycle cpus, then they make them multicycle. You are misleading this guy
circuitgamer77#0377: In my opinion splitting up instructions into discrete steps makes them much easier to understand at first.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Google it circuit, but that's what your insinuating
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: So your registers usually don't have a 0 address by the way. They start at one instead of 0.
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know that term in this context.
circuitgamer77#0377: ?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Stop, don't even bring up pipelining to this guy lmfao
circuitgamer77#0377: It could be split up into multiple cycles if you want though - the timing could be easier to work out then.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: For example a load from memory to registers doesn't use the alu
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: But the instruction may not use all the paths
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: All of that happens in one cycle
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: This is just an example of the data path of the CPU.
Keklord#1759: one at a time
Keklord#1759: to write from its registers to the ALU registers?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: No haha
Keklord#1759: the CPU had 4 different instructions
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
Keklord#1759: so if im reading the diagram correctly
Water#1039: <:thunking:446109191392985108>
circuitgamer77#0377: Might need to find a simpler looking diagram...  It's a bit hard to read.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: That's the local register file the CPU operates on
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: See the bank with 2 reads?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
Keklord#1759: I guess rather than "dual reading" the addresses it would be more accurate to say reading a 32 bit address and interpreting it as two separate 16-bit addresses
circuitgamer77#0377: You write A, then B, then the ALU is connected to A and B and calculates a value.  You then have an instruction to read directly from the ALU to the bus.
Keklord#1759: Yeah those could both work
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: And you can have several of them
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes
Keklord#1759: <@!548699973672370222> so like memory registers planted right before the adder?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: He said registers
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Yes! Dual read is perfect for this situation
circuitgamer77#0377: That's why you have registers that act as input to an ALU
Keklord#1759: but for my registers I wanted to be able to add two separate 16-bit numbers, which would require reading them both at the same time
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Ehhh I guess you could see it that way in an abstracted view, but lower level, not really
Keklord#1759: So I can only read/write from one address at a time for my RAM which is 1 address being 1 byte
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: But 2 reads is a great idea for registers
circuitgamer77#0377: If I'm understanding you correctly, other way around.  RAM is just a bunch of registers selected by address.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: You don't need multi write
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Uhm
Keklord#1759: so are my registers supposed to just be copy-pasted RAM that support multi-write and multi-read
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: my latest cpu used port maps instead of memory mapping the io, but the ports are just used to set up a DMA transfer between io device and system ram so im okay with that
circuitgamer77#0377: This is one of the more confusing conversations here so far, so don't get too worried :)
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 🌈 Logic World 🌈
Keklord#1759: I have averaged 10 hours a day since buying this game
Keklord#1759: welcome to logic world
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: welcome fellow nerd
Water#1039: wow i bought this game bc it looks fun, but boy what did i get myself into
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if its input device you cant write to it, and if its output device you cant read from it
circuitgamer77#0377: True
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yes so using the io is just like using ram and no special instructions or precautions are needed
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but instead of being mapped to ram, its a memory cell for In or out
circuitgamer77#0377: It is
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its literally ram
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: circuit, no, stop
circuitgamer77#0377: To use that, you would need an 8 bit data bus and also a 16 bit address bus.  It could get a bit confusing...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: IO units
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: not operations
Keklord#1759: thats interesting
Keklord#1759: so have certain operations output to specific addresses?
circuitgamer77#0377: I saw that being used on the 6502, so that's definetly an option.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: even if your cpu doesnt use all the addresses for physical ram, you can map IO ports to it. thats how MMIO works
circuitgamer77#0377: You could if you wanted to.
Keklord#1759: I guess I didn't really consider I could make each RAM address hold 16-bits
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm using a 32 bit address.  That is my system.  He's using an 8 bit address.  That's his system.  We both have RAM laid out as something other than linear, but we also both just see that length address for the CPU.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: dont confuse the fella
circuitgamer77#0377: No...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: we were purely talking addressing
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and the addressing
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: now youre confusing the data
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: woah
circuitgamer77#0377: As an example.  My RAM is built with it's own mapping of 32 bits to 128 25 bit banks, but the CPU doesn't care about any of that.  It just sees the 32 bit value.  The way his RAM is currently designed, it's like he has 4 bits to select a bank and 4 to select within the bank, but his CPU should just see an 8 bit address.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: in digital the logic sim
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so what im saying is if you dont have the ram built, why bother specifying how you split the physical banks out xD
circuitgamer77#0377: And what do you mean by digital limits is 2^24?
circuitgamer77#0377: It's fully capable of having a 32 bit address into RAM, it's just the limits of the simulation.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no you physically couldnt in LW, or in digital(digital limits is 2^24)
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't have it built, but I could if I wanted to.  I designed it so that I could build the first few addresses of each bank, so the CPU can have more spread out data.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you may have a 32 bit address bus, but not all of that is mapped to ram
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you dont have 2^32 bytes of ram
circuitgamer77#0377: Example: My 32 bit ram is organized in banks, with each bank having 25 bits within the bank and 7 bits to address which bank, but the CPU just sees it as a single 32 bit address.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: they just need to use it to fill arrays and junk
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but the programmer doiesnt care how ram is layed out
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: were telling you, functionally, its no difference
Keklord#1759: so whats the difference then
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you did that
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no that is the decoder my dude
Keklord#1759: I would just have a logic to manually check for every single address possibility?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: just as 1 8 bit value
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: but you dont look at it as 2 numbers
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: no you keep the decoding the same
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes.
Keklord#1759: so rather than decoding 2 separate 4-bit values
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: from address 0 to 255
circuitgamer77#0377: Just a single 8 bit value (in your case) rather than two 4 bit values.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: like a 1D number line
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: one after the other
Keklord#1759: could you define linear addressing
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ^
circuitgamer77#0377: Linear addressing makes writing programs much easier to think about, while also meaning that you can work with a simple program counter and pointer math.  RAM can still be built as a 2d grid, but the CPU sees it as a 1d line of registers.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: gotchya, if you wanna bounce ideas back and forth lmk, im working on a 3d render engine in hw
circuitgamer77#0377: I do want it to work with several tiny cores, though.
Keklord#1759: Im not sure how else you would efficiently address the RAM if not using this simple method
circuitgamer77#0377: Not sure yet - I've barely started design on it.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: does it actually have matrix multiply units?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: wym gpu
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm debating using a 2d mapping for my GPU, but that's a special case that I don't think applies here.
Keklord#1759: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ^
circuitgamer77#0377: I think you'll find that one 8 bit address is much easier to work with than two 4 bit addresses.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and they increment from 0 to 2^n-1
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ehh not really, at the end of the day its ram addresses
Keklord#1759: yes but in reality the physical locations correlate to X and Y locations, plus its easier for the human brain to understand this way
circuitgamer77#0377: I would say your first CPU should probrably have all busses be the same width as your RAM (8 bits) (I think it's easier to think about), so your registers would also be 8 bits.  Generally CPUs have multiple registers, plus whatever components are needed for calculation, and a control unit.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: x and y would make sense if it was for a display or something
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you can just combine those inputs without a space between them and lable it "addr" instead of "x" and "y"
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: of 8 bits where the x is the low 4 bits and the y is the high 4 bits?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you realize thats a single address
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: with the xx and y addresses
Keklord#1759: which to be fair he probably got it from someone else too but, moral of the story I never would have came up with it myself
Keklord#1759: Wasn't my idea, came from one of the geniuses in this discord
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: its the smarter way to do it imo, scales easier
circuitgamer77#0377: Ah, so you're arranging it in a 2d grid rather than a 1d line.  That's interesting, I like it...
Keklord#1759: which I guess is just an 8 bit address?
Keklord#1759: an X address and a Y address for a total of 256 different addresses
circuitgamer77#0377: or 8 bit addresses and 8 bit values?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: a cpu is something that can execute a set of instructions afaik
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: If you only have 8bits of addressing and you have 16 bit addresses generated by the CPU, you can use those remaining addresses for memory mapping
circuitgamer77#0377: So 4 bit addresses and 8 bit values?
Keklord#1759: This is my memory system, should give reference
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: So like, you can address as many ram bits as you want.
Keklord#1759: 
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: Haha
Keklord#1759: Well thats the thing I dont have a CPU nor do I actually know what one technically is
circuitgamer77#0377: Is your CPU 8 bit?
Keklord#1759: yes
circuitgamer77#0377: Is your ram 1 byte per address?
Keklord#1759: well for my RAM i can only read and write from one address at a time
circuitgamer77#0377: I'll be right back, I need to switch computers...
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <@!164535185084252161> can you clarify?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think they're asking about the size of a single register, not the register count.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: my 32bit cpu has 64, 32 bit registers lol
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: the amount of registers you have should be independent of how many ram addresses you have
circuitgamer77#0377: (so my 32 bit CPU has 32 bit registers)
circuitgamer77#0377: I pretty much always have my registers be the same number of bits as the bus of the CPU.
Keklord#1759: so perhaps I should overestimate
circuitgamer77#0377: I would say design your register to fit the rest of your system.  It's easier to expand RAM (in general) than it is to replace registers in your CPU (also in general).
Keklord#1759: im thinking 4 bytes?
Keklord#1759: If I have 256 bytes of RAM, how big should my register be?
Keklord#1759: I'm pretty sure I put this game on a m.2 drive
Ecconia#4929: ^That step takes ages when generating the colliders for components. Some say exponential runtime... Uff. <[newline]> No worry, yar welcome
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: thanks
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: gotchya
Ecconia#4929: Then the client processes/prepares that downloaded world and sends a response to the server, once done.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: oh so loading into the server still takes a while for a client, gotchya
Ecconia#4929: It is client sided 100%. I wire-sharked the connection. The downloading of the whole world is done in at most 1 minute...
101#1688: The slow loading appears to be client side iirc
Ecconia#4929: None so far. But keep in mind, that I am not using that server currently. Since now that we have ~12MB, it takes like 10 to 20mins for me to join. Which is horrible. <[newline]> So I just have it running and updated for the sake of it. And once the loading-performance has been improved, I will play on it again.
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so im just curious how a server loading a world 24/7 reacts haha
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: apparently large game files take ttens of minutes to load
CrispyPin#1149: heh
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: do you notice weird perfromance issues?
Ecconia#4929: <#905378240338726942>
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: im curious how the filesize affects the server if its loaded 24/7
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: <@!151293812675706880> so jimmy notfieid me that you have been runing a server basically continuously?
GHXX#9078: if the format is wrong it just throws an exception
Ecconia#4929: The amount of spaces should not matter. But the parser should give you an error if its not good enough - play with it
CrispyPin#1149: custom save format go brrr
GHXX#9078: right, so for anyone that has the same problem in regards to setting up the whitelist: <[newline]> The way you add users is by adding a line below the list you want to add them to, which starts with 4 spaces, a dash, another space and then the username of the person to add there
Ecconia#4929: https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/SUCC/wiki/Collection-Types#array
GHXX#9078: apart from that i was also wondering what the format of the user ids array in the config.succ serverconfig? <[newline]> by looking at the code it appears to be some sort of string array, but waht id are we talking about, and how would you enter 1 or 2 users?
Ecconia#4929: It is already considered afaik. However at current state it is not optimal to optimize there, cause other game parts are clearly lacking and limiting. Thus it's difficult to reach the simulation limit.
GHXX#9078: I see, i saw yesterday that the cpu usage of the server (which probably is the one responsible for doing circuit simulation) is quite low, but i also feel it could be a bottleneck for huge circuits later down the line, and it is usually much harder to switch from a single-threaded environment to multithreaded later rather than sooner <[newline]>  <[newline]> So i suppose the conclusion is: consider multithreading the simulation, or keep it in mind when developing it further
Ecconia#4929: The answer is: <[newline]> The simulation (currently) does not use multiple threads. <[newline]> Luckily even with a single thread, the simulation has plenty performance due to its design. <[newline]> (Other parts of the game could need more threads though)
GHXX#9078: So i have done some digging in this server to try to answer my question "to what extent is LW multithreaded, and how far does it scale up", and i seemed to have gotten conflicting answers. <[newline]> So ill just ask here: <[newline]> 1. Does LW utilize multiple threads for executing logic gates <[newline]> 2. Is there a limit to the number of utilized threads (again for logic calculation)? (like 8+ threads) <[newline]>  <[newline]> It should definitely be possible to run updates on a threadpool as long as two circuits are not interacting with it at all. But also stuff depending on delays can be threaded sometimes because in the case of a delay you know that the output cannot change within less than the delay time
PseudoGoose#2841: <@!326543226058309632>
PseudoGoose#2841: yes, usually there are 2 read busses and 1 write
Michael#8718: How do RISC style register adds work?  Like ADD r1, r2, r3?  Are there multiple ports or busses in the register file to allow one cycle adds?
Keklord#1759: may not be possible without spacing them out more
Keklord#1759: cant figure it out either
Keklord#1759: havent thought about how to get the output yet lmao
Keklord#1759: This is what i have so far
Keklord#1759: relays?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: On outputs of  dlatches i mean
OopsieDoopsie#0412: You better have relays on an output so you'll read it only when reading bit is on
Keklord#1759: I mean I'm gonna duplicate it a shitload
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if it satisfys your requirements and constraints
Keklord#1759: not really sure how else id make it
Keklord#1759: This seems like a fine design for ram?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: ;P
Keklord#1759: thats smart
Keklord#1759: I see
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: that gets you 256 outputs
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: and then AND them together in the intersections
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: put them on the x and y addresses
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: for example if you have 8 bit addressing on your ram you can have 2, 4bit decoders, call them x and y
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: you can use a matrix decoder
Keklord#1759: because then to decode each address I would need logic to determine which one is selected, which would end up being significantly larger than the ram itself
Keklord#1759: would i address them 00000001 through 00100000
Keklord#1759: If I am making ram, how should I go about finding each individual byte? Like if I have 32 8-bit parts
OopsieDoopsie#0412: well thanks for making it clear
OopsieDoopsie#0412: ye i've used alu reg cuz i couldn't figure out if i need a register or not, untill i tried to do it
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: store word from reg to ram
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: load word from ram to reg
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: yeah i would do it in code
OopsieDoopsie#0412: cuz my pc is literally running on punching cards
OopsieDoopsie#0412: yea i guess i need a register than
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: haha
OopsieDoopsie#0412: yea im doing reduced for sure :D
OopsieDoopsie#0412: well i see words reduced and complex so
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so if you think the memory needs to swap locations, its done in code
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: so i would use a register
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: odds are youre doing risc lol
OopsieDoopsie#0412: oh boy if only i knew what those are
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if its cisc you can have a memory swap operation
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: if its risc you would need to load to a register and then store to a ram loc
OopsieDoopsie#0412: cuz if i do something with value it stores in ALU register anyway
OopsieDoopsie#0412: well just moving it from one address to the other, can't really think of a real reason to do so
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: like i guess swapping for sorting?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: do you have an example where you specifically need to do this?
TheWildJarvi《THE SEMI SEER》#1337: hmm
OopsieDoopsie#0412: do i normally need a register to transfer data from one RAM address to the other?
PseudoGoose#2841: Yes, unfortunately, the game doesn't run "offline" properly, even in single player it tries to launch and connect to the local server on a network interface. This will be fixed, hopefully in one of the next updates.
commander of the pandas#1576: Does starting the game in offline mode just not work? I don’t have internet and I sent this message with data
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: am i doing something wrong or is it currently broken
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Ive set high contrast crosshair but it doesnt work?
Daimh#5870: What is the backstory behind the name Bobby?
Keklord#1759: yeah that is quite a bit simpler
OopsieDoopsie#0412: Yeah, 4bits can be displayed 0-F, next 4bits will just take a second 7segment
Keklord#1759: yeah ill make that first then
Keklord#1759: oh wait nvm it literally just lines up into the 4-bit sections mb
Keklord#1759: but even converting pure binary to binary hex is going to be difficult isnt it?
Keklord#1759: I plan to make both
OopsieDoopsie#0412: <@164535185084252161> if you want to use 7 segment and don't want to bother with double dabble, just display your value in hexadecimal
Keklord#1759: wow that's incredible I get it now
Keklord#1759: thank you
Keklord#1759: I'm going to look more into this and hopefully come back more educated with a finished product
Keklord#1759: and that took forever
Keklord#1759: I made a single adder that puts two different 16-bit memory sets together
NxthingbutV0id#1939: Here’s what you’d want
NxthingbutV0id#1939: Yeah, yours would only be a max of ~1000
Keklord#1759: so the 8 bit one is significantly smaller id assume?
Keklord#1759: yeah im just doing 8 bit
NxthingbutV0id#1939: 131070 exactly
NxthingbutV0id#1939: That’s 16 bit, so the max number is 65000+65000
Keklord#1759: lord
NxthingbutV0id#1939: Mostly yeah
Keklord#1759: that whole thing is for it?
NxthingbutV0id#1939: Here’s my 16 bit one from adder/subtract into the double dabble and then into decimal into a 7 segment display
Keklord#1759: I was trying to make a truth table before to figure it out but, so many wires everywhere
NxthingbutV0id#1939: Nope, only logic gates
Keklord#1759: (not that i would be against that but I was trying to put it off)
Keklord#1759: build my own processor
Keklord#1759: yknow
Keklord#1759: wouldnt that require me to
NxthingbutV0id#1939: https://youtu.be/eXIfZ1yKFlA
Keklord#1759: no idea what that is
NxthingbutV0id#1939: You would need something called a double dabble
Keklord#1759: ive been trying to figure this out for like an hour
Keklord#1759: but what about 2 digit numbers
Keklord#1759: getting numbers 1-9 converted from binary to decimal and then displayed, isnt that hard
Keklord#1759: so i have a 7 segment display
OopsieDoopsie#0412: ;w;
RyanT#1426: the "fat output", whos official name is a "blot", has a baked in 1 tick delay
RyanT#1426: thats how it can be instant
OopsieDoopsie#0412: can someone explain it? why fast buffer has a peg on an output, and not that fat output? it feels not right. is there any reason behind that?
Artin_#3197: probably just functions as a buffer
Artin_#3197: this is one fine cursed mess
OopsieDoopsie#0412: i was looking for 74181 alu and i saw THAT. What the hell is this? 1 input AND gate?
Artin_#3197: toggles button
Artin_#3197: 
Moldytzu#4226: the d latch is your friend then
Artin_#3197: 
Hugin#2596: is it even possible to save boards?
NxthingbutV0id#1939: Well duh, I mean get a toggle without using a switch
Moldytzu#4226: there is the switch
NxthingbutV0id#1939: Is there a way to make a button toggle
Hugin#2596: is it possible to bind saving boards menu and stuff to a key?
Ecconia#4929: In your world folder there is an "ExtraData" folder. In there are a bunch of SUCC files (less than 4), just look for the one with World type. <[newline]> It has two numbers and two colors.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes, but I'm away from my computer with the game installed so I can't remember which one...  One of the world files has the world type and hex values for the colors.
Lisa#4756: I'm against compactifying.
Lisa#4756: mmm, well I like the sense of scale
Daimh#5870: Is there something in the world file I can modify to change the checkerboard colors without breaking anything or making a new world?
Daimh#5870: ~~Dang good idea~~
HomelikeBrick42#1173: ~~just remake your own logic world with that feature~~
Daimh#5870: (I do know mods exist but I kinda wish it didn't have to be a mod)
Daimh#5870: Dude I wish you could shrink a set of nodes to a smaller gate because something like this would be so useful as a small block
PseudoGoose#2841: So this is technically 1 tick on, and instant off
PseudoGoose#2841: but in this case, because the signal line is also being used to turn it on, it takes 1 tick for the signal to pass through
PseudoGoose#2841: it takes 1 tick for the relay to switch after its top input changes. But signals will go through it instantly when it is on
OopsieDoopsie#0412: but when state is changing on the sides
OopsieDoopsie#0412: oh no, not switch activation
OopsieDoopsie#0412: oh right, relay has a delay after switch activation
PseudoGoose#2841: Really interesting problem! I think it might be possible with relays (sorry for the mspaint quality, don't have access to the game rn)
HomelikeBrick42#1173: its here
Daimh#5870: But I cant find it
Daimh#5870: I thought there was in the patch notes yeah
HomelikeBrick42#1173: there is a setting for highlighting all wires connected to the peg that you are looking at?
Daimh#5870: What is the button to see all pegs connected to the peg you're hovering over?
zplilpz#9574: when building a data bus between components i've been triggering a mux to put data on the bus and a latch to store data off the bus on the other side from the same control signal, and relying on a 1 tick buffer delay on the mux side so the latch closes before the mux. Is there a better way than relying on 1-tick offsets?
Sekoia#3968: you could like... put an and, and hook each input in, but that won't allow it to move back and forth
Sekoia#3968: nothing that doesn't block direction afaik
OopsieDoopsie#0412: so that signal can run in both directions, but delaying
OopsieDoopsie#0412: is there a way to create 1t delay without buffering? <:megathink:797979154549178399>
Dragon Lord#6944: Off topic: Nice PFP :)
hyperfluff#0001: ah ok, yeah i just found the folder button that lead me to the games files so i just figgured to place them there in the saves folder or how it was calles <[newline]> now im struggling with understanding what each component looks like 😄
Sekoia#3968: I think for now it is?
hyperfluff#0001: alrighty, i was able to manually insert it into the games world folder but is that the only way to do it?
hyperfluff#0001: like is there an import button somewhere that im just not seeing 😄
hyperfluff#0001: heya, how can i import the creations i download from the "browse creations" section 😄
Theix#5229: Anytime 😎
Sekoia#3968: yeah that's what I got stuck on thanks!
Theix#5229: Tutorial here, use CTRL to select multiple pegs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P6E4Sj5qMs
Sekoia#3968: how do you do multi-wiring?
doongi01#7242: Thanks!
Theix#5229: If you are only familiar with logic gates, I would suggest trying to learn some boolean algebra, as that can give some deeper understanding of what happens when you combine logic gates. Now if boolean algebra is too boring, don't worry as it isn't necessary for just building circuits, but it is definitely nice to know. If you are just looking to build complex circuits using multiple gates, I would suggest you try starting with building a half adder, and then later on you can turn it into a full adder, and then maybe add more functionality. You can find lots of circuits just by googling for example "half adder", and going to google images. Another thing I would suggest would be to try and build some of the circuits from Ben Eater's 8 bit bread board computer, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=2 <[newline]> He explains the individual functions and principles really well, and I personally learned a ton from that series. Now don't worry if you don't understand it completely, just try building the circuits from the videos, and play around with them to analyse what they are doing, I personally find that the best way to learn. Last thing I want to say, don't be scared to just try something. It never hurts experimenting on your own, and you will get a deeper understanding of the underlying principles. <[newline]> But that's just my two cents, hope it helps. 👉 😎 👉
doongi01#7242: I’m new to the game and, while I know about logic gates, I don’t know how to put then together to do more complex logic like a CPU or a calculator. Does anyone know of any tutorials, videos, articles, etc.. to help me bridge the gap?
Lysus#2109: Thx!
HomelikeBrick42#1173: <#905378240338726942>
Lysus#2109: Is there a list of public servers that people can go on?
blane1257#8086: at the cost of complicated control circuitry, long read and write times, and probably lag
blane1257#8086: delay line memory can be considerably more compact at scale
blane1257#8086: well hang on, i think i have to beg to differ
Artin_#3197: guess you're right
Limón#7879: 1 d latch
CrispyPin#1149: that would depend on your requirements
Artin_#3197: what is to this day the most compact storage module in lw
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: You can make a 2 tick toggle with a d latch and inverter. Or a 1 tick toggle with 2 d latches, but you have to set one any time you copy it.
Limón#7879: Feed a d latch output into an inverter than feed that into its data and then one tick pulse to the write peg
Artin_#3197: but the best t flip flop i managed to make is really slow
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yea. But sometimes you want to set something and then unset it. But you could send multiple sets or unsets in sequence.
Limón#7879: I do not see use case
Artin_#3197: yes
Limón#7879: Doesn't a t flip flop toggle
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I've just been using toggles and delays
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Basically
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: A jk latch is an sr latch without the ability to break
Limón#7879: When I look up jk latch it tells me that it's shit and don't use it
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I've wanted to make a jk as well. Haven't made a good one. My recent thought that I haven't tried to make yet is 2 d latches, each et to turn the other off.
Limón#7879: Jk latch?
Artin_#3197: does anybody have a good jk latch design <[newline]> i can't get mine to work
sybergoosejr#8256: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
sybergoosejr#8256: you can flip your boards
Jimmy#8080: Not right now, coming in a future update.
Artin_#3197: nvm
Artin_#3197: can you mirror boards?
Sekoia#3968: is this any good?
Sekoia#3968: fun
Sekoia#3968: alright, so I have to essentially choose between speed and having a huge circuit that I have to manually build
Jimmy#8080: Yes, that is totally fine. Thanks for asking!
8o7wer#4073: I did set the protocol to UDP, yeah. What do you mean having to overwrite IPv4?
CrispyPin#1149: then connect to the inverted or normal address for each bit
CrispyPin#1149: you can also have an inverted copy of the address next to it, so you only need one inverter per bit
HomelikeBrick42#1173: its just an and gate with either buffers or inverters plugged into it
Sekoia#3968: I'm not sure how I'd do it
Sekoia#3968: anyone got a quick screenshot of a basic demux then?
Sekoia#3968: oh boy
zplilpz#9574: thats a lot of wires 🙂
Sekoia#3968: yeah, but I need 9 bits for the width, 8 for the height
zplilpz#9574: lots of wires? for 4-bits you can use 16 4-way AND gates
Sekoia#3968: okay but how do I do demuxs as a whole?
CrispyPin#1149: you can have an x and a y demux, and each pixel needs both enable lines to write
Sekoia#3968: I need a bigass display, but simple drawing, but idk how to mux the whole thing
Sekoia#3968: how do you make dsplay drivers?
CrispyPin#1149: coming ~~january~~ may ~~next year~~ 2045
DADp#7461: 5 years prety much*
CrispyPin#1149: i think we are getting that in 0.91
CrispyPin#1149: coming <:soontm:674268728027906086>
Artin_#3197: how do you place multiple things at once?
PseudoGoose#2841: Related to that: is the server query API stable and/or publicly documented? A cool community project would be a server  indexing site, which would collect and present data like game version, uptime and player count
Deleted User#0000: is there any active servers i can join
Ecconia#4929: Mostly its enough to just move the board by 1 square
Ecconia#4929: Yeah, I have that a lot. I DM'ed a world with that bug to Jimmy. But I forgot to create an issue, uff.
DADp#7461: gets on the side of the glass and impossible to see
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: I hate when my glass of water overflows
Limón#7879: Me when stack overflow
PLYSHKA#6201: Its mostly for someone who didn't know <[newline]> 'nvm' is worst type of answer you want to see when looking for it
trucksarenoisy#4659: i already know
PLYSHKA#6201: ctrl + g
trucksarenoisy#4659: nvm
trucksarenoisy#4659: how to copy again?
PLYSHKA#6201: i see... good to know that it's not only me
HappySpleen#7516: The only resize bug I get is one that causes a crash but I have no clue how I am triggering it so I have yet to report it, So far I feel it has to do with amounts of parts on the board and possibly size of the board (Large).
101#1688: I’ve run into this many times in singleplayer. I suspect floating point shenanigans
PLYSHKA#6201: did anyone encounter it? it's singleplayer
Limón#7879: Sounds like it
circuitgamer77#0377: Bug.
PLYSHKA#6201: bug?
PLYSHKA#6201: and when i put it back on the ground resized, it became resizeable again
PLYSHKA#6201: 
PLYSHKA#6201: i can resize it when it's not on grid
PLYSHKA#6201: i am missing something?
PLYSHKA#6201: why i can't resize that board?
Ecconia#4929: Did you set the protocol to UDP (when forwarding/firewalling)
Ecconia#4929: On my Linux server, it does not detect IPv4, so I have to overwrite that. <[newline]> But then connecting should work...
8o7wer#4073: with ipv6-dualstack I can connect from localhost on my computer but not externally
8o7wer#4073: Does anyone else have issues with not being able to connect to their server? I tried to run the server locally and on my vps using steamcmd (both linux) and both timed out, I tried port forwarding + changing the firewall :( + changing config.succ to use ipv4 network stack
Ecconia#4929: <@!154964593397989376> Hey ho, so I have been working on a proxy project. And am currently adding git to it. <[newline]> Its more or less a hobby project, so support and determination is more or less not there. <[newline]> However it contains class-structure protocol-format and even website-API structures. <[newline]> So is it okay for you if that project ends up on GitHub? Personally I do not need it there, but I would upload it, if you do not mind. Maybe someone else is interested. It is however written in Java, so good luck porting to whoever. <[newline]> I will however not add the website-api certificate. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Btw, current state of project: I can join a server, and disconnect from it. + Parsing all packets (even world) the server sends. <[newline]> Supports verified accounts.
DADp#7461: buggies <:frog_happy:733352650091003955>
Ecconia#4929: It is: <https://logicworld.net/tracker/116>
Daimh#5870: I hope thats a bug
PseudoGoose#2841: I _think_ that's a bug
circuitgamer77#0377: Cloning boards doesn't save the state of latches, though.
PseudoGoose#2841: but it also also saves whatever bit the D latch is currently storing
Daimh#5870: Gotcha
PseudoGoose#2841: actually it does also save wire states
PseudoGoose#2841: er
PseudoGoose#2841: and the game figures out the correct wire states from that
PseudoGoose#2841: yes, wire states aren't saved, but component states are
PseudoGoose#2841: the state of the D latch is saved
Daimh#5870: Wait but this doesnt work if you close and open the world right? (I thought power states werent saved)
dragoncon2009#5697: That helped a ton
dragoncon2009#5697: Thank you!
PseudoGoose#2841: Yes
dragoncon2009#5697: So the long pin that's facing towards the button
PseudoGoose#2841: but any of the latches
PseudoGoose#2841: data in, not clock*
dragoncon2009#5697: Oh
PseudoGoose#2841: doesn't matter
dragoncon2009#5697: Which one?
dragoncon2009#5697: ok
PseudoGoose#2841: so attach a switch to one of the latch inputs, turn it on, press the button once, and remove the switch
PseudoGoose#2841: you need to start with one of them powered
dragoncon2009#5697: ?
dragoncon2009#5697: Those aren't working what am i doing wrong
Daimh#5870: Because if its constant is this Dlatch system necessary?
Daimh#5870: Just a constant clock?
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: im in need of a clock for my PC project in Logic world, so I think that it's good that a clock circuit came up lol <[newline]> EDIT: im still learning how logic world works, but im learning by making a project
Daimh#5870: I didnt think of that
Daimh#5870: Wait so this is just a Dlatch clock essentially <:7ACOSP_lmao:755810746310459432>
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: i meant the clock, but i see what you mean
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: yeah
PseudoGoose#2841: but it operates like this
PseudoGoose#2841: not strictly MIDI
PseudoGoose#2841: "sequencer" is a concept in electronic music, yes
PseudoGoose#2841: uhhhh
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: Correct me if I'm wrong but, Isn't that similar to MIDI in a way?
Daimh#5870: Yeah I thought that was also a solution to the question (the question seems so broad to me lol)
PseudoGoose#2841: I interpreted your question as a "sequencer" that cycles through the outputs given a clock input. If that's the case, here are a couple ways of doing it:
Daimh#5870: If you want it
Daimh#5870: <@!118121598388666375>  <[newline]> https://youtu.be/Cc_J3uzDgZ4
Daimh#5870: I am not sure I am understanding your question correctly though. With this if you have more than one input at once it will output whatever inputs are going in and at that point there is no need for the Dlatches 🤔 (The dlatches just make sure that if there is a pulse, that output stays on)
Daimh#5870: Assuming you only send one signal at a time
Daimh#5870: This isnt really a flip flop but might work for what you want 🤔
Daimh#5870: I was finishing this statement sorry lol
Sekoia#3968: three way?
dragoncon2009#5697: ?
Daimh#5870: With a flip flop of sorts
dragoncon2009#5697: i know how to make filpflops but is there to make a three way flip flop
Daimh#5870: To be honest to me it sounded like they wanted a monostable circuit
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you could turn it on <[newline]> then after a delay <[newline]> turn it off and then activate something else
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you could do that automatically to turn a signal on and off
Daimh#5870: Isnt that just a flip flop though
HomelikeBrick42#1173: when you press the buttons it switches state
HomelikeBrick42#1173: 
dragoncon2009#5697: and how do you make a three way latch?
dragoncon2009#5697: I'm just new to the game and don't really know how to do pretty much anything
dragoncon2009#5697: but automatic
dragoncon2009#5697: yes something like that
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you set a latch and after a delay turn the latch off and turn on anohter one which is for the next component?
Sekoia#3968: how do you multiplex large amounts of pixels?
dragoncon2009#5697: like you turn on the circuit and one thing turns on then it turns off then a different thing turns on.
PseudoGoose#2841: the critical question: what do you mean by "activate"
Daimh#5870: Like what input system would you be needing here?
Daimh#5870: What do you mean?
dragoncon2009#5697: how do you activate one component and then stop using that component and use a different component instead of the first? (sorry if that sounded stupid or just doesn't make sense)
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: so 8 inputs
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: of which there are 2
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: for each 7 segment display
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: well, 16 outputs, but 4 inputs
Daimh#5870: Is that 16 inputs for it though?
Daimh#5870: <:monakS:680050832540041232>
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: I dont want to wire this mess up every time i copy lol <[newline]> (this is an 8-bit hex display)
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: ok. i was only copying the board that attached all the other boards togther. Thanks! 😄
Artin_#3197: (to my knowledge)
Artin_#3197: copying different components doesnt
Artin_#3197: copying a board also copies the wires
The_Circuit_Guy2828#5138: when you copy multiple PCBs (I mean circuit boards, I just call them PCBs because they are basically the same thing), how do you copy the wires as well?
Artin_#3197: ok
Ecconia#4929: You do not (yet). The board saving/loading feature will come back in a later version. It got disabled in Early Access.
Artin_#3197: how do you save boards?
CrispyPin#1149: hold ctrl while placing
trucksarenoisy#4659: How do you set pegs next to eachother like that
Daimh#5870: Alright sounds good :p
Ecconia#4929: To my knowledge, there is no tool to do this in one go.
Daimh#5870: (I wanted to know if there's a way to do this in one full motion or not)
Daimh#5870: This might better explain it. I have groups of 4 wires to connect but these already have single pegs in the center (which cant be easily moved) I was wondering if there's an easy way to connect them and skip the single pegs. Normal spacing doesnt work, but I wasnt sure if there were any shortcuts that are hidden
Ecconia#4929: I do not understand your question... <[newline]> I fear the answer to it is "no" though. <[newline]> You can skip pegs with mouse wheel while selecting a MWP group. (might be buggy)
Daimh#5870: For example say I wanna skip this middle peg
Daimh#5870: So I know you can adjust the spacing like this but can you make it so it is in groups of a certain number?
PseudoGoose#2841: UDP port 43531 https://logicworld.net/view/pst-44f2a22f/server-hosting-tutorial
Daimh#5870: What are the ports for the servers?
Aaron Speedy#8362: that doesn't seem to be working  for me
HomelikeBrick42#1173: yes
Aaron Speedy#8362: Does it work that way on circuit boards?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: then that will be the default rotation for new objects that you place
HomelikeBrick42#1173: when you click to place an object before you let go of the click <[newline]> you can use q and e to rotate the "ghost" object
Aaron Speedy#8362: Is there a way to change the default rotation of an object?
Limón#7879: 1 tick on
Limón#7879: so it's only instant off
Limón#7879: but it takes 1 tick for it to process 😔
Limón#7879: tried to make one
PseudoGoose#2841: and power the other input
PseudoGoose#2841: connect 1 to itself
cheese3660#8641: If it were possible
cheese3660#8641: Put 2 into eachother and it would crash or freeze
Reese4221#8317: yes but it would be funny :)
cheese3660#8641: Instant computation would break the game
Reese4221#8317: was hoping to be wrong
Reese4221#8317: yea i figured
RyanT#1426: that's impossible
Reese4221#8317: anyone got a instant XOR gate?
Daimh#5870: This is just much easier to execute :)
Daimh#5870: I cant find a system that works with that for 4 inputs, a trigger input, and 4 outputs while having zero additional space on the side so I'm just going to increase to a 3x3 display size instead
CrispyPin#1149: 
Daimh#5870: Wym?
CrispyPin#1149: then put them in front of each other
Daimh#5870: :p
Daimh#5870: The board blocks the connections to the peg that opens the Dlatch
Daimh#5870: (This is 4x4 but I'm showin that the display is going to have all the pixels right next to eachother)
CrispyPin#1149: what do you mean by impossible
Daimh#5870: I think I may just re-size it to 3x3 because with a size like this its impossible to have inputs work when on a grid system
Daimh#5870: Gotcha I didnt think about removing the board in that spot <:7ACOSP_lmao:755810746310459432>
Daimh#5870: <:miu_zoomeyes:549652843628462081>
Daimh#5870: (I know previously I did see someone using some sort of floating tech to get this to work but I am unsure what that is)
CrispyPin#1149: 
Daimh#5870: Or like are there building techniques that would make it easier
Daimh#5870: How do I compress the Dlatches enough for a 2x2xZ space that can be duplicated upwards?
Daimh#5870: So I have a question on suggestions or tips for this (one sec)
Daimh#5870: Or is that hard coded?
Daimh#5870: Is there a secret setting to adjust maximum board size?
Daimh#5870: Yeah :p
DADp#7461: collision on display panels arent check when resizing :D
Daimh#5870: Or something idk
Daimh#5870: Then we build a fully functional 32 bit computer and run logic world in logic world
Limón#7879: what will happen after all the bugs get fixed and modding is done?
Daimh#5870: Found another bug I guess <:LUL:707664722043863070>
RyanT#1426: yeah
Daimh#5870: 🤔 so its likely not a good idea either way
RyanT#1426: 1. no, if u want 1x1, 3 pegs is ur max <[newline]> 2. if u want a tileable display, 2bbp is prob. possible, but prob. not 3
Daimh#5870: Although 9 pin displays seem to be incredibly laggy when placing them for some reason
Daimh#5870: I just wanna know if you can place them very close to eachother somehow
Daimh#5870: I mean I'd figure that out later
Daimh#5870: What do you mean 👁️👄 👁️
Verlio_H#0201: omg ryan said a swear I am literally shaking and crying right now
RyanT#1426: how the fuck would u even hook up the d-latches??!!
Daimh#5870: So with these 1x1 panels is there any good way to set them up to work with 9 pins without separating the pixels? (or scaling them up)
bejoscha#0284: <:thenking:446109302369812490> Okay. Still feels a bit odd. I guess they are *secret* to most users, or is there a documentation anywhere?
CrispyPin#1149: there are a lot of options like that
CrispyPin#1149: secret just means it's not in the settings menu, only in the config file
bejoscha#0284: <@!154964593397989376> What's the point of speaking of *secret settings* in the release changelog? Shouldn't they either be, eh, *secret*, or fully documented?
JamHexxit#6386: what is the smallest T-Flip flop in the game?
Sekoia#3968: you can transmit signals through them using through pegs
Sekoia#3968: they're just boards, they let you modularize your circuits
not_a_bot(Just_a_human)#0535: so, I was wondering how to circuit boards work. I kinda thought they would transmit data through them, but they do not.
Sekoia#3968: the only way I can think of is to have essentially just divide the 17 bits I need into to outputs using relays, basically one relay being open when bit X is active, and the other being closed when bit X is active (i.e. the same as the other except NOT bit X).. buuut that sounds like a massive pain to wire up
Sekoia#3968: I need to multiplex 256x512 pixels.. what's the best way to do that?
Ecconia#4929: I forgot the reason, for them to be removed... Since they are practically Buffers, just with a different shape... <[newline]> The buffer as component has more than enough reason to exist, but the shape is mostly, inefficient
DADp#7461: why need two 1 tick delayers when have 1, less complex
DADp#7461: i doubt jimmy would add them back because of tge reasonibg
CrispyPin#1149: that would be nice too
Ecconia#4929: And I would like the old 1-tick delayers back - the small ones 😛
DADp#7461: <:bobby_in_love:698430534187089920> bye delayers, hello buffers
Ecconia#4929: Yes, but I absolutely dislike using more components than I have to. Cause that's inefficient (game-wise). <[newline]> But yeah if one does not care about space, hell no problem.
CrispyPin#1149: january 2222
DADp#7461: *an entire year*
DADp#7461: scratch that
CrispyPin#1149: see you in "january" ||may|| lmao
DADp#7461: time to wait an updtate
DADp#7461: not the block
DADp#7461: and thats modifying the slider
DADp#7461: he took the easy way to remove 1 tick
CrispyPin#1149: in fact i want him to realise that 1tick delayers > buffers
DADp#7461: well
CrispyPin#1149: its not like he will fix it now
DADp#7461: @ jimmy 😈
CrispyPin#1149: you can do it without editing world files if you have one around since before the update
DADp#7461: still kinda cheaty
CrispyPin#1149: no you can have a 1tick delayer in your hotbar
DADp#7461: i bet thatll work large scale
DADp#7461: so, you're saying, all i have to do to get one tick is to, find a component in a world file, change its tick number to 1, reload the world and you have it
CrispyPin#1149: as i described further up in this channel, you can get around that
DADp#7461: mhm 1 tick delayers
CrispyPin#1149: I will continue using 1tick delayers where practical
DADp#7461: works: yes. ugly: yes. probably no other solution: maybe
CrispyPin#1149: ew
DADp#7461: for a *sorta fix*
DADp#7461: slap a peg
DADp#7461: boards perfectly fit under buffers
DADp#7461: <@!151293812675706880>
Red_3D#3062: I am currently working on ObjFix 1.2, which will make the process in blender a lot simpler. I am planning on making a full tutorial on rendering logic world circuits in blender once 1.2 is out. If you have any immediate issues with 1.0, feel free to ping me.
Stenodyon#8192: It's in the changelog for version 0.90.2, you can export a world to .obj with the `objexport.world <world name>` command
Ecconia#4929: <@!138380569573720065> <@!284602593597194250> you can probably answer this question 🙂
commander of the pandas#1576: is there a tutorial on how to convert logic worlds to blender or how do I do that myself?
Ecconia#4929: RIP - I miss this old friend
RyanT#1426: <@!154964593397989376>, why did u replace 1 tick delayers with a worse, and different component?
CrispyPin#1149: oh and if you don't have one in your world you can copy, add this to the player file (when the world is closed) <[newline]> `        - MHG.Delayer, AAAAAAEAAAA=, 1, 1`
Ecconia#4929: Yeah, and I rather not use bugs :/ (Imma hop into vc)
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: A delay at 2 does work with a 1 tick pulse. But it delays 2 ticks. I think its a bug though.
commander of the pandas#1576: and I never even thought about using an AND gate to do a 1 tick delay, is there any drawbacks to that?
CrispyPin#1149: not without more circuitry
Ecconia#4929: You cannot, sadly.
Ecconia#4929: I have yet to find an actual advantage for Buffers over Delayers, besides having a little bit less simulation memory and GPU usage.
commander of the pandas#1576: you can use a multi tick delayer to delay a 1 tick pulse, this isn't Minecraft
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I know right!?
CrispyPin#1149: delaying a 1tick pulse easily lmao
Ecconia#4929: Or a buffer next to an inverter, which I do constantly
commander of the pandas#1576: ... what's the point of that
CrispyPin#1149: can't even do this with buffers 😔
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Oh sweet. I'm gonna have to rebind middle mouse(mines broken).
CrispyPin#1149: unless you actually set it to a higher value you can't undo it
CrispyPin#1149: opening and then cancelling the menu will still set it to 2
CrispyPin#1149: as long as you don't open it's menu it will stay on 1 and work
CrispyPin#1149: don't tell jimmy but if you have a 1tick delayer in your world you can ctrl+middle click to get it in your hotbar
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: All my decoders and serial delay lines are broken now. If the input pin on the buffer was just a bit higher or tilted up like the delayers It'd be perfect. Now I need to use bounce pegs.
CrispyPin#1149: but at this point people are used to the big fast buffers so maybe they should stay that size
CrispyPin#1149: we already had 2 ways of getting a 1 tick delay in a small space, and gates or delayers
CrispyPin#1149: which just didnt affect the issue at all
CrispyPin#1149: the slow buffer was added when people complained at the fast buffer being too big
commander of the pandas#1576: I assume it's because most of the time you only need to buffer one tick to confinsate for the delay of something like an invertor on the other side,
commander of the pandas#1576: force you to use a buffer for 1 tick since buffers are a bit more akwardly shaped
CrispyPin#1149: since delayer on 1 tick is equivalent
CrispyPin#1149: yeah the addition of the slow buffer was pointless
commander of the pandas#1576: why have two things do the same thing kind of dilema
commander of the pandas#1576: huh it used to be able to, but yeah you're suppose to use a buffer for 1 tick
CrispyPin#1149: it's in the latest patch notes
CrispyPin#1149: its a feature for some reason
SET001#3031: is it a bug or is it intentional that value of delayer can't be lover than 2?
Sekoia#3968: I need to multiplex 512x256 things, what's the best way to do that?
circuitgamer77#0377: Correction - delayers connecting the latch output to reset.
circuitgamer77#0377: Instant buffer and normal buffer with their inputs connected together and outputs conencted together extends a pulse by 1 tick - you can stack them in series to make a longer pulse (each one added can have the normal buffer be replaced by a delayer of the length of the incoming pulse or less).  For very long pulses I use a latch (made with a dlatch and two instant buffers) and delayers tying set to reset)
HomelikeBrick42#1173: turn a t-flip-flop on <[newline]> then after the delay turn it off?
Reese4221#8317: how do you make a one tick pulse longer?
PseudoGoose#2841: it has to be in a specific orientation
PseudoGoose#2841: <#901158328405729371>
circuitgamer77#0377: Instructions in the meantime:  <[newline]> 1. Place board flat <[newline]> 2. Grab board and use t to toggle flatness <[newline]> 3. Try to fine move the board.  Bug.
PseudoGoose#2841: Just made a video demonstrating how to reproduce from a clean save, will share in a sec
circuitgamer77#0377: Took me a moment to find the zip option...  I haven't used it in forever.
circuitgamer77#0377: That's the folder.
Reese4221#8317: if by whole save folder you mean the entirety of the world yea
circuitgamer77#0377: 
circuitgamer77#0377: Do I need to send just the world file, or the whole save folder?
Reese4221#8317: manually zip it
circuitgamer77#0377: Tried to send the folder, guess that doesn't work...
Reese4221#8317: if you have nitro it gets bigger
Reese4221#8317: pretty sure any file under the upload limit
Reese4221#8317: you can send zips
circuitgamer77#0377: I can do a Google Drive link...  That's the easiest for me.
circuitgamer77#0377: How should I share the world file?
circuitgamer77#0377: Can I send zip files in discord?  I don't know how to share the save...
circuitgamer77#0377: One moment...
Jimmy#8080: @ me when you have something
Jimmy#8080: Thank you very much!
PseudoGoose#2841: let me figure this out and I will get back to you
PseudoGoose#2841: hang on
PseudoGoose#2841: woah ok I just did
PseudoGoose#2841: heck
PseudoGoose#2841: but i'm unable to reproduce 😔
PseudoGoose#2841: > so pretty much any board that starts as a flat board has its fine placement messed up if it's made into an upright board
Jimmy#8080: That discussion has neither of the two things I listed
PseudoGoose#2841: <@!154964593397989376> check this not-a-thread thread: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901158328405729371/906796150596722699
Jimmy#8080: It is not fixed, but I can fix it if you get me one of the following two things within the next hour: <[newline]> - Step by step instructions for reproducing the bug <[newline]> - A save file with a board where this consistently happens when you pick it up
circuitgamer77#0377: Is it fixed in the update?  If it is I can wait for that later tonight.
circuitgamer77#0377: This could be a problem - the thing I need to fine place is the entire frontside of this, which is really hard to move or rotate.
PseudoGoose#2841: beyond that, I don't really know
PseudoGoose#2841: they mentioned a couple things in the link I gave, it may or may not help
circuitgamer77#0377: Is there a way I can fix it?
PseudoGoose#2841: it is a bug: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901158328405729371/906789550125379594
circuitgamer77#0377: This might be a bug, but for now I'm assuming I've hit a key I didn't mean to - I can only finely move vertically placed boards parallel to their face, while normally it's the other way around.  Example - I could move this board to offset it across the line as it is in the screenshot, but I couldn't move it out of the center of the square in the other direction.  Normally that's the other way around.  If this is a key that I accidently pressed, what was it?  I want to go back to moving boards the way they have been moving.
circuitgamer77#0377: Just pausing and unpausing worked to come back from 0 (for me).  I typed in the command for 10 fps, then paused and unpaused.  That worked.
Ecconia#4929: Just be careful with `0`, cause it might be that then there is no more tick to change the simulation speed 😛 <[newline]> -> World reloading to fix
HomelikeBrick42#1173: ive tried `0.1` and it seemed to be 1 tick every 10 seconds 🤷
Sekoia#3968: I tried, it seemed like it was just 0
HomelikeBrick42#1173: i think you can
Sekoia#3968: btw, can you not use fractions?
circuitgamer77#0377: `server "simulation.rate <tickrate>"`
LeO#9303: how do you change the amount of ticks in a second?
blane1257#8086: yeah, but if it were to work at all it would just slow the physics rate way down to be able to have time to solve the entire circuit every tick
CrispyPin#1149: there aren't instant gates so that would depend on the implementation...
Saltypretzel#0321: weird question..... if there was a huge circuit in logic world, and everything was performed using theoretical "instant" components? what would it do? would the game break?
Rawfullz#2873: thanks a ton guys, going to get back to work!
Rawfullz#2873: ah, because in minecraft a green concrete block and a red concrete block are seperate items, yeah that makes sense
HomelikeBrick42#1173: if you use ctrl in minecraft it copies the nbt data of the block (like chests filled with items)
Rawfullz#2873: ohhh thanks, i wanted to be sure i wouldnt make something ELSE become weird like that... ie copying a delay value that i thought was going to be generic
circuitgamer77#0377: I think middle mouse copies a component, while mod-middle mouse also copies it's properties, but I'm not sure on that.
Rawfullz#2873: Going to give that a try, or perhapse i can rebind the middle mouse to do the same function as ctrl+middle mouse?
circuitgamer77#0377: I tend to rebind a lot of things to mouse buttons.
circuitgamer77#0377: It is (although for me it's thumb button 4)...
Rawfullz#2873: so i never thought to ctrl+click
Rawfullz#2873: i think in minecraft it is just regular middle mousebutton
circuitgamer77#0377: You're welcome :)
Rawfullz#2873: YES, thankyou!
Rawfullz#2873: ahh ok lemme try ctrl
circuitgamer77#0377: Just tested it.
circuitgamer77#0377: ctrl-middle click :)
DADp#7461: might be P
circuitgamer77#0377: I might have gotten the keybind wrong, let me check...
circuitgamer77#0377: You have to pick that object from the world
DADp#7461: oh wait what
Rawfullz#2873: oh no joke?
circuitgamer77#0377: Middle mouse button on an object in-world, I think...
Rawfullz#2873: Hello, I discovered Logic World about 2 weeks ago, absolutely loved it so far! the first and only issue i have so far is that I have no idea to change the color of an item down on my toolbar, EX: I wanted to make a (simple)RED matrix display, but i cant seem to change the item in the toolbar so the rest of them are already set to red instead of yellow. When i first started the game i noticed there were multiple colors of circuit board down in the toolbar along with various switches and gates etc... Is this a feature that isnt added yet and those items were something i cant make on my own? any help is appreciated!
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ok thanks for the response! Im going to try it again now that it makes more sense
circuitgamer77#0377: It's based on the fact that the first half adder in every adder can be calculated simultaniously.
circuitgamer77#0377: It's hard to put in words...
circuitgamer77#0377: Whether or not the carry should be allowed to go through is always determined by only the A and B input for that bit, so if you use a relay to allow the signal through when exactly one of the two inputs is on, every bit is calculated at the same time and the carry can be allowed through by every bit at the same time.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: i cant get my head around it lol
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: can anyone explain an instant carry adder?
jackson535#1361: it's not everyday you hear someone ask "how to increase bobby size"
CrispyPin#1149: it's jackson so yes
Daimh#5870: Really? :p You just had to say that didnt you?
jackson535#1361: 
jackson535#1361: 2-3 inches? 4-6 inches? 7-8 inches
jackson535#1361: how much larger do you want to be?
Daimh#5870: Oh neat
Ecconia#4929: "playerscale" command or so
Dragon Lord#6944: Idk how tho lol
Dragon Lord#6944: There is a way to do it
Daimh#5870: I dont think you can 🤔
HomelikeSquid65#8653: how do u increase bobby size
Jimmy#8080: Edit the world's `worldproperties.succ` file (might be called something slightly different, I don't remember). There's a field called `WorldTypeID`, change it from `MHG.Grasslands` to `MHG.Gridlands`
Jimmy#8080: should be fixed in 0.90.2
Jimmy#8080: tomorrow
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Oh, it's a 4 tick clock.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: K
Sekoia#3968: I'll check it out tomorrow, I'm going to bed
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: 
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Hmm, I'll try to make the flat version count up or down...
Sekoia#3968: So 5 ticks total
Sekoia#3968: Only way I know of to count down 1 is to invert at the start, add 1, invert at the end
Sekoia#3968: How'd you manage that btw?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Getting it to count up or down was a bit tricky. but possible. still works on a 3 tick clock.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: NP
Sekoia#3968: Very smart trick, thanks for bearing with me there
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: well, more like cut back on number of and gates.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yup. I used the same trick to speed up an adder. CLA adder.
Sekoia#3968: Basically it was using relays vs and gates that causes the speed up. Thanks!
Sekoia#3968: Fancy!
Sekoia#3968: I see
Sekoia#3968: Bc if relay 2 and 3 (left to right) swapped, it takes them... a single tick to update
Sekoia#3968: Right, so the leftmost relay has to wait 2 ticks to be 100% sure of the result it gets
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Would would be the input to the increment. then the xors would be the output of the increment.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: the d-latch output is the stored count.
Sekoia#3968: Where's the input/output?
Sekoia#3968: Right, but switching takes a tick
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: not quite. the the top of the relay has a 1 tick delay. but once the relay is on. a signal will pass through all of them instantly just like a wire.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Here's a flat version that only counts up
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: 
Sekoia#3968: But bit 7 requires to relay bits 0-6, which takes log2(7) ticks
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: then the signal to the side carries through instantly
Sekoia#3968: So them being hooked up into series makes them take N ticks where N is the number of bits
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Only to switch on or off which happens to all of them after the first xor.
Sekoia#3968: Right but each and takes a tick
Ecconia#4929: One way: Create a Gridland world and copy the config files for the type over.
bejoscha#0284: If I have a "grassland" world, how can I convert it into a gridland world? I kind of remember having read about a console command somewhere, but can't find it anymore.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Being hooked up in series combines the ands. so each block up adds another xor to the cascade of ands, starting with the carry in and first xor.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yup
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: which also connects to the second xor that outputs.
Sekoia#3968: the relay is just an and no?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: the xor output goes to the top of the relay.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Input goes into an and and an xor, with the other and and xor input connected to the switch for changing between count up and count down.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Sorry. I'm trying to think of how to explain it. I took it from a blurry youtube video.
Sekoia#3968: right, so input goes into an AND
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: 
Sekoia#3968: yeah I don't get how it works lol
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Can't really get a very easy to read shot of this. But the relays are connected to each other in sequence from the carry in, then theres a zigzag between the xor in, and the xor out.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: 
Sekoia#3968: but... how?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Closest to the screen is the 3 tick counter with monostable. The relays on the left are just for muxing between the count or a set value. The relays on the right are the carry. In the center, which you can't really see, is the half adder with extra xor for counting down. It runs on 3 ticks regardless of how many bits.
circuitgamer77#0377: (by the way, in case you don't know - if you scroll while selecting multiple wires, you can set an interval to use.  Example - If you have pins 1,2,3,4,5,6, then you mod-select them and scroll once, it will select 1, 3, 5, and if you scroll again, it will select 1, 4.)
Daimh#5870: And now I am getting this over and over... Nice <:Hmm:872602955881259009>
Daimh#5870: Ah ok
circuitgamer77#0377: no way to do that...  Just do 1, then 2, then 3 and 4.
Daimh#5870: (I mean like this, I cant seem to get it to work)
circuitgamer77#0377: As long as the input and output each form a line, it should work.
Daimh#5870: (or like one peg that is bumped up out of a string of pegs)
Daimh#5870: Is there a way to do the mod thing btw with wires that are on a diagonal?
Daimh#5870: Yeah :)
Daimh#5870: Like Shift Mod and then every peg touching the wire would get the wire attached or somethin
circuitgamer77#0377: Better than memorizing another keybind.
circuitgamer77#0377: It makes sense...  I think it's a good way.
Daimh#5870: Huh that seems like an odd way of doing that, I wish there was an easier way 😆
circuitgamer77#0377: I've done that :)
Daimh#5870: I had to flip it
Daimh#5870: Oh wait I got it to work
circuitgamer77#0377: So mod
circuitgamer77#0377: Example: If you have 5 bits, ctrl-select bits 1 through 4, then select pins 2 through 5.
Daimh#5870: By select do you mean use mod or multi-select
Daimh#5870: Wait what? Do you have a video? <:Hmm:872602955881259009>
circuitgamer77#0377: You beat me to it :)
HomelikeBrick42#1173: so you are connecting all of the pegs except for the last one to the next peg
HomelikeBrick42#1173: and then select all of the pegs except the first peg
HomelikeBrick42#1173: select all of the pegs except for the last peg
Daimh#5870: So I know how you can place multiple wires between two sets of pegs but is there a way to quickly place one wire down a line of pegs?
Sekoia#3968: because the last pin needs to AND all of the other pins, which takes 3 ticks, plus another one tick for the last xor
Sekoia#3968: how did you get 3 actually?
Sekoia#3968: I got 4 ticks for up, 6 for down
Sekoia#3968: wow, 3 ticks?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: It can count up or down on a 3 tick clock.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: That's similar to my counter/incrementer. Though I used relays in series to produce the effect of parallel adders. It's actually a half carry look ahead adder.
Sekoia#3968: 2 extra ticks tho
Sekoia#3968: (just plugged in a not on each end of the incremementer)
Sekoia#3968: aaaand decremementer completed
Sekoia#3968: (the reason it's faster than the tileable version is because I have parallel ands)
Sekoia#3968: and multiplex them together
Sekoia#3968: so I'm gonna make a decrementer as well
Sekoia#3968: actually, I'm trying to make pong
Reese4221#8317: i presume you will loop the output into the input?
Sekoia#3968: plus, the footprint isn't *too* awful
Reese4221#8317: oooo
Sekoia#3968: 4 tick incrementer!
Sekoia#3968: and it works!
Sekoia#3968: <@!617228318537809920> it is complete
Reese4221#8317: oh god
Sekoia#3968: my version has progressed into even more of a mess lmao
Reese4221#8317: once it gets another signal it stores a 1 in its d latch and starts outputting a constant signal for the next cell
Reese4221#8317: something along the lines of check if previous module has a value if so wait for a signal on the other socket
Sekoia#3968: internally I mean
Sekoia#3968: okay, how does it work?
Reese4221#8317: i pressed the button five times here
Reese4221#8317: no its not a shift register
Sekoia#3968: but that'll increment every bit no?
Reese4221#8317: put down eight of them
Reese4221#8317: yes
Sekoia#3968: yeah, but I want to increment an 8bit number
Reese4221#8317: in a line
Reese4221#8317: you can tile them
Sekoia#3968: no?
Reese4221#8317: its probably horrible but it works
Sekoia#3968: but that's just a single bit?
Bolver#3230: When is the bugfix update coming? :/
Reese4221#8317: give it a one tick signal from the first socket and a constant on the second and it will increment
Sekoia#3968: oh, okay lmao
Reese4221#8317: it increments
Sekoia#3968: what's that do?
Reese4221#8317: 
Reese4221#8317: i have this mess
Sekoia#3968: any solutions?
Sekoia#3968: trying to make an incremeter, but this feels really unclean
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: or jnc
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Hmm. I suppose I should set carry always with Adc instruction, and add would just be add, so then it's up to the programmer to use the correct one using jc
Broyojo#2667: for subtracting, turning on carry-in and negating one of the inputs is important
Broyojo#2667: in that case you can turn on carry-in or just set one of the inputs of the ALU to be 1
Broyojo#2667: yeah you would maybe have like an "increment" instruction of something
Michael#8718: Seems simplest to just set or don't set carry in.  I presume that's how a bit slice ALU worked.  Not sure about other types
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: For an add with carry instruction, is it typically implemented as a conditional or always setting carry in?
Michael#8718: Fair 'nuff 🙂
Jimmy#8080: We've only had five messages here in <#901199821212352573> today. I don't think there's currently enough traffic to justify splitting the channel right now
Michael#8718: Jimmy, or mods, I wondered about a room dedicated to questions on digital logic.  To separate general game questions, from digital logic specific questions?
Michael#8718: I see people talk about decoder circuits a lot.  What do they usually mean?  I don't think they mean instruction decoder.  Are they talking about de-multiplexers that can be used to go from n selection bits, to 2^n control lines?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: when trying to make this i ended up using alot of t-flip-flops and it got really messy
HomelikeBrick42#1173: for my cpu there is a sequence of things that needs to happen <[newline]> e.g. <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> load the instruction pointer onto the bus <[newline]> select ram address that is on the bus <[newline]> stop loading the instruction pointer <[newline]> wait for ram to select the address <[newline]> load instruction from ram <[newline]> ... <[newline]> ```
Nanoflower#8082: sequencer?
Nanoflower#8082: thank you ><
HomelikeBrick42#1173: is there any semi compact way to make a sequencer without alot of t-flip-flops?
Attikitty#2900: is it possible to  make a 1-tick pulse without any form of inverter?
Michael#8718: I would be slowing it down though
Michael#8718: I guess I could take the "easy" way out, and increase my PC to have 3 bits of instruction step counter
Michael#8718: How are people implementing multiplication control logic?
Michael#8718: My PC only allows for four instruction steps.  Maybe the first two steps would be to write the ROM data to one ALU register, and the general purpose to the other.  But then I would have to start up the multiplier control board, which would need it's own timer somehow, or async control sequence
Michael#8718: A basic multiplier setup, using a manually operated control board wasn't too bad, but having my CPU control unit activating it, sounds non trivial
circuitgamer77#0377: shift-rotate left and shift-rotate right is another dimension of rotation as well :)
Sekoia#3968: you can use T by default to rotate circuit boards, nothing else tho iirc
Sekoia#3968: right, I googled edge detector and I figured out a nice circuit
Daimh#5870: Just a small bit of feedback, it would be nice to just have a Mod + Q or E to rotate on the third angle :p
Jimmy#8080: oop never mind you got your answer earlier 😅
Jimmy#8080: Press F while placing. (This is unintuitive and awkward, I will be improving these mechanics)
Jimmy#8080: Not now but I definitely want to add this capability
Sekoia#3968: I can guess what an edge detector is, but I'm not sure how to build one
Sekoia#3968: do you have an example?
Dragon Lord#6944: Any clock with an edge detector
Sekoia#3968: reposting this, because I can't figure it out :(
Ecconia#4929: For laying boards, use the `F` key to flip it. This does not mirror the board.
HappySpleen#7516: 
Sekoia#3968: right, what's the best way to make a clock with a 1-2 tick high, n tick low clock?
Nanoflower#8082: but do please send in clocks
Nanoflower#8082: nevermind i did it
Nanoflower#8082: I need something smaller than what I have here
Nanoflower#8082: Can someone show me the simplest togglable clock one can make?
zjobke#1742: oki thank u
zjobke#1742: :/
Limón#7879: You do not unless you have a roof
zjobke#1742: how do I flip a board to be upside down
blane1257#8086: ah i see
Daimh#5870: Yeah that was the main problem
HomelikeBrick42#1173: iirc copying doesnt save signal state
blane1257#8086: so you just need to insert that signal when you build it then you should be good
blane1257#8086: yes, but the signal should be stable i think.. you shoudlnt be able to break it is what i mean
Daimh#5870: This only works though if you already start off with a signal inside the D latches though right? 🤔
TheAffinity#3062: Thank you! Nice to see I'm actually understanding my Udemy course 🙂
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yep
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I used it to make sure only one of 2 things are selected on any given tick.
TheAffinity#3062: On a completely different question topic my understanding is that the Carry Out of a Full Adder to be connected to the Carry In of another Full Adder. Is that correct?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: 
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: You can have the Q, and Q' change at the same time, with 2 D-Latches hooked up like a bit shifter shifting into itself.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I see that
Daimh#5870: It looks right <:Hmm:872602955881259009>
Daimh#5870: Yeah that is what the and gate along with the inverter and switch is for
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: The simplest I can think of is a D-Latch output to inverter to it's input, but you need a 1 tick pulse to toggle it.
Daimh#5870: This is how that works btw
Daimh#5870: (Also #2 I am not using sockets, because even with small amounts they crash my game, but this just demos how I would connect it)
Daimh#5870: Also I'm not entirely sure this is a proper one tbh
Daimh#5870: This is the simplest one I could think of but it still seems like it should be able to be smaller
Daimh#5870: What is the simplest T-flip flop that yall know of in this
TheAffinity#3062: Yeah, that part I'm trying to master.
HomelikeBrick42#1173: its helpful for me because then i can get 3 wires through a 1 block gap
TheAffinity#3062: Wouldn't putting the pins closer together increase the risk of collision because space becomes a bit more cramped?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: also you can hold down control to place pegs with a smaller grid
TheAffinity#3062: You mean something like this?  (screen grab from my Udemy course on Intro to Logic Circuit design that I am taking).
ieee 802.11ac#6337: make parallel lines of wires
TheAffinity#3062: Are there any suggestions some of you might have in how to lay down wire neatly, so I don't run into object collisions as a result of clipping? I'm reliving my stereo hookup days from the 1980s 😄
Daimh#5870: Ah thank you :)
Ecconia#4929: "F" (key)
Daimh#5870: Yeah I got the two dimensions to work, but the problem is neither of them will orient this board properly
Michael#8718: You could run the clock into multiple, parallel delayers.  But not sure that's what you want
Michael#8718: I don't know about your assembly, as it has three dimensions, but for two dimensions, use shift-E and shift-Q to access a different axis of rotation.
Daimh#5870: I have tried pretty much any combination I can and I cant get it to rotate right <:notLikeThis:230174289775689728>
Daimh#5870: Is there some way to flip this on the opposite horizontal board flatness?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: they're technically in the game, just hidden
circuitgamer77#0377: through-sockets are coming, just not yet :)
IndustrialDonut#2459: or do you have to put them *on* the board on the edges for example
IndustrialDonut#2459: is there a way to put sockets like through-hole in a circuit board?
circuitgamer77#0377: And relays are bi-directional
parallacks#7542: If the top pin is high when the signal comes through then its zero tick I think. Vs an AND gate which is always a 1 tick
IndustrialDonut#2459: Now that I realize this, what are relays actually used for vs AND?
IndustrialDonut#2459: They have 1 tick delay if the top pin changes o.o
IndustrialDonut#2459: I thought those had zero delay! NooooO!
IndustrialDonut#2459: OH NO IT WAS THE RELAY DELAY
IndustrialDonut#2459: ah, it was the D-Latch's delay
Dragon Lord#6944: No
IndustrialDonut#2459: Do sockets have a tick-delay?
parallacks#7542: Is there a way to make a variable rate clock? Like enabling a certain number of delayers?
Satan#9850: yay
Stenodyon#8192: The soundtrack will be available for purchase later this year :)
Satan#9850: Same
Daimh#5870: I really like it :)
Daimh#5870: Are there plans in the future for a DLC to purchase the soundtrack?
Daimh#5870: Ah gotcha, Thank you :)
ieee 802.11ac#6337: pick up the board then delete it
Daimh#5870: I can press R to remove normal stuff but I cant remove a whole board with stuff on it
Daimh#5870: Hmm is there also a way to delete emtire boards?
Daimh#5870: Ohhh gotcha
ieee 802.11ac#6337: put the things on a board
Daimh#5870: Every time I right click and then do clone it doesnt copy the wires
Daimh#5870: Is there a shrotcut to clone with the wires?
Daimh#5870: I think you can just plug an inverter into itself. :p (if your solution was harder than that)
SET001#3031: I don't like this solution because 1. each memory card is a bit massive and 2. it is near impossible to set address for each card if I would like to have memory amounts like tens and maybe hundreds cards
SET001#3031: this is how each memory card looks like
SET001#3031: 
SET001#3031: am I on the right way?
SET001#3031: I'm trying to build a RAM memory blocks in LW. Each block is (traditionally) 8 bit and is connected to 8 bit data bus and 8 bit address bus + 1 wire to controll bus state (read write).
Geralt von Rewe#2240: nvm found a solutotion
Geralt von Rewe#2240: or better say repeat a signal without giving a new Input
Geralt von Rewe#2240: How can i build a clock ?
Deleted User#0000: Soon
LeO#9303: Yes, like that
LeO#9303: Ok
Daimh#5870: Like a schematic or blueprint library?
circuitgamer77#0377: Not yet, but it's being worked on
LeO#9303: Is there a way to save stuff and put it into another world
Smaller Abyss#1716: <@120288063896289280> That is the problem with it, anything you might be able to make a NOT gate out of probably uses them internally.
IndustrialDonut#2459: That's actually pretty interesting, I see what you mean. I think that electronically it might still require not gates internally since the latch (as in, to analyze how that would be fundamentally built), but I know I'm just being really particular lol, nice idea!
Smaller Abyss#1716: The only problem with it is that it negates input only for a certain length of time when the input is on. It is fine while off, but may have a bit of delay switching the output on.
Smaller Abyss#1716: <@120288063896289280> If you know  the length of the pulse, a circuit like this may work for a NOT gate. It starts by switching the latch off, then after a delay switches it back on. It is the closest thing to a NOT gate without using any NOT gates I can think of.
Smaller Abyss#1716: <@120288063896289280> Not to my knowledge. I would just use the in-game XOR gate.
IndustrialDonut#2459: I believe you're right. <[newline]> Is there a way to build up an XOR without using a NOT though lol?
Smaller Abyss#1716: <@120288063896289280> Perhaps an XOR with a constant input?
IndustrialDonut#2459: Can you make a not-gate without the stock not-gate?
CrispyPin#1149: sadly not
ieee 802.11ac#6337: ctrl+g
Michael#8718: Is there a way, using Z (multi-select) to paste more than once?
Svea Rike#1376: Oh is there a way to enable them?
LeO#9303: ok thanks
CrispyPin#1149: 30 by default
LeO#9303: How many ticks are there in a second?
PseudoGoose#2841: They are in the game, but not finished / not very easy to use so they're off by default
CrispyPin#1149: will be in 0.91 update, planned for december
Satan#9850: Alright
CrispyPin#1149: not yet
Satan#9850: Its is possible to save an entire board?
cheese3660#8641: Because outputs are the source for the next state
cheese3660#8641: I dont think itd be that easy
Limón#7879: They could change that
cheese3660#8641: An output requires a 1 tick delay
cheese3660#8641: Because phasic links are meant to be between inputs only
Limón#7879: Why is there no phasic output peg
Svea Rike#1376: Did the through sockets from that socket video not get added?
LeO#9303: ok thanks
CrispyPin#1149: by putting it on a board and copying that instead
LeO#9303: How do you copy paste stuff with the wires?
Nanoflower#8082: Thank you!

Deleted User#0000: oh ok
commander of the pandas#1576: what JPM suggested
Deleted User#0000: what what implies?
commander of the pandas#1576: Which is as simple as you can get
commander of the pandas#1576: Honestly I think what that implies is to just have the machine constantly cycle which out of 10 outputs is going to do and what you select at the time is random if you didn’t already know what it’s on
Deleted User#0000: i guess a clock would do it
Deleted User#0000: okay xD
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: ofc without mods
Deleted User#0000: and without mods?
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: without oracles
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: Program a pseudo-random generator from 1 to 10 in LW
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: Third and more interesting option:
Deleted User#0000: i try to keep it as simple as i can.
Deleted User#0000: it will be for a autonomic memory cell.
commander of the pandas#1576: I just hate re rolls that’s all
Deleted User#0000: i like it with simplicity
commander of the pandas#1576: It only requires a multiplier and a rounder
circuitgamer77#0377: It would either require a gigantic circuit or a lot of looped processing though.
commander of the pandas#1576: Another solution is to generate a random number between 0-0.999… and multiply by the number you want it to be out of and round up. This would require no re rolls
Deleted User#0000: yeah
PseudoGoose#2841: Oh, you could also apply some of the techniques from 2. to 1.  E.g., specifically picking a power of two that is close to a multiple of your range. That will minimize the probability that you have to re-roll. And likewise, as n gets larger, the re-roll probability also decreases.
Deleted User#0000: Interesting! I got it!
PseudoGoose#2841: if you think about it, with random bits, you can only generate uniform numbers in ranges that are powers of two. (0 to (2^n)-1). <[newline]> There are a couple options depending on your needs: <[newline]>  <[newline]> 1. Generate just enough bits, and reject and re-roll if you generate a number outside the range you want - this is a perfectly uniform distribution, but not constant-time. <[newline]>  <[newline]> 2. Generate n bits , picking n so that  2^n is _close_ to a multiple of your range. E.g. if you want to generate a range of 7 (0-6), then 6 bits (64 possible numbers) is close to a multiple of 7 (63). Then apply some function that (almost) uniformly maps all the values 0-63 into your target range 0-6. It will be slightly not uniform, there will be a slight bias to one of the numbers, because it will have one more mapping than the others. But the benefit is that it's constant time. And generally, as you increase n, the bias gets smaller.
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: pink sus
circuitgamer77#0377: If you read it at relatively slow intervals, you can do a clock that has 1 tick delayers and a 1 tick pulse running through it, then have it be clocked by the OR'd result of several prime length (or just not very divisible by each other) clocks.  That will produce the appearence of random numbers, with it seeming even more random the more input clocks you use.
Deleted User#0000: I ♥ Oracles
Deleted User#0000: Yeah, that was my thought
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: 4 oracles and if the output is superior to 10, rerun it
circuitgamer77#0377: That's harder...  I'll think about it
Deleted User#0000: when i want a random number between 1-10 do i use 4 oracles on 4 bit lanes and activate all at once. The result can be from 0000-1111 which are 16 numbers. And when ever was picked above 11-15 i put the signal back into the system to generate a new number?
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: oracles?
Deleted User#0000: How do i make this random generator in logic world?
circuitgamer77#0377: I don't know which factors determine that yet.
circuitgamer77#0377: It's not consistent based on complexity for me, so every new board being cloned lags a significantly different amount even if the complexity is similar.
circuitgamer77#0377: I know, it's just weird when relitively small movements lag.
PseudoGoose#2841: so at some point you will see problems, it might be for circuits that are 2x bigger than everyone else but you will still get that eventually
circuitgamer77#0377: I think there may be a graphics memory leak by the way - every time I clone or move something the GPU usage increases slightly until it's using 99% while paused.
PseudoGoose#2841: because it's at least an O(n) update with regard to the size of the circuit being moved
PseudoGoose#2841: i mean, everybody is experiencing that regardless of their PC's specs
circuitgamer77#0377: I have a pretty fast computer (optimized for a smaller number of faster threads) which is why I'm a bit confused.
PseudoGoose#2841: Oh yeah, my theory is that it is recalculating and updating the positions of all moving components. But yeah, I'm not sure why CPU usage doesn't spike, it _might_ be a memory bandwidth issue.  <[newline]> Either way, if that is the bottleneck when moving things, it should be possible to mitigate
circuitgamer77#0377: And it doesn't spike while cloning.
circuitgamer77#0377: It's not a GPU bottleneck either - that does spike in some cases but I think I know the bug causing that.
circuitgamer77#0377: It's pretty much only when cloning or moving (which makes sense).  I would just expect to see it using a whole core or using more RAM when it's struggling so much.
PseudoGoose#2841: what performance problems are you seeing exactly?
circuitgamer77#0377: If it isn't that I don't understand why I'm not seeing one core maxed out.
circuitgamer77#0377: So is the limitation (and reason it doesn't use a whole core) because it's waiting for other threads to finish?
PseudoGoose#2841: Just "giving it more resources" isn't that straightforward. <[newline]> - LW is not multithreaded, it has a couple threads internally but it doesn't really benefit from more than 4 CPU threads. (It might be optimized to be more parallel in the future but idk) <[newline]> - It will use as much memory as it needs (trust me I know, loading very large (>20MB) saves almost exhausted my 16GB RAM). Allocating extra might even make performance worse - because C# is a garbage-collected language, it needs to occasionally scan memory to get rid of unused objects, and a larger allocation means more time scanning
circuitgamer77#0377: Is there a way to allow Logic World to use more resources?  It really feels like it's limiting the amount of RAM and CPU it can use (even considering that it's only using one core of my CPU)
Ecconia#4929: Fight causes not symptoms.
Verlio_H#0201: yeah but that is more work
Jimmy#8080: Or I should find and fix the underlying problem, because that behavior makes no sense
Verlio_H#0201: jimmy should just make the game automatically lower the render distance when loading in and raise it back when loading is finished
circuitgamer77#0377: I have to turn it down before loading, then turn it back up
circuitgamer77#0377: I have this problem when I load a world with a high render distance setting.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: anyone else unable to keep a world alive for more than 3s? At the moment i will load in with everything there and then 3s later game crashes with no errors or anything. (World is 6.5MB but when it does load (1,100 chance) it runs fine at 60fps) I've said also in bugs/problems but this seems more active and i just want to know if anyone has/had this problem
dutchminer2011#0450: I'll rebuild manually
dutchminer2011#0450: its all very compact though
CrispyPin#1149: so you can flip it manually
CrispyPin#1149: you can move the displays around without destroying the wires
dutchminer2011#0450: I built a whole 7 segment display mirrored
dutchminer2011#0450: oof
CrispyPin#1149: not yet
dutchminer2011#0450: is there a way to mirror a circuit?
TheAffinity#3062: I'm at work right now so I can't run the console in LogicWorld, so I can't remember what the console command is to slow the tick speed in-world. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Ooop. Nevermind. I was looking at one of Michael Bauers's YouTube videos during my "break" ( 😉 ) and found the command is  server "simulation.rate x" where x is a numeric value.
Jimmy#8080: And I can confirm what Goose said, there shouldn't be any restrictions besides that
Jimmy#8080: Just a quirk of how the root component address is saved, nothing to worry about
gnog#2259: thanks!
gnog#2259: that matters a lot
gnog#2259: shit
PseudoGoose#2841: Child components have to be written _after_ their parents
gnog#2259: <@!154964593397989376> does it matter in what order components in save files and assemblies are saved?
gnog#2259: but after reloading it becomes C-0
gnog#2259: why for components i just placed "Debug.TargetInfo" says nothing about it's parent
gnog#2259: in real world it's just some physics i guess that doesn't allow that, but in lw world you can use this design (i did the same with my first cpu)
Curze#4096: Alright, will try to lower the draw distance when loading in 👍
Stenodyon#8192: People have reported shorter load times if you set your draw distance to the lowest setting before loading (then you can set it back to default once loaded) <[newline]> Unfortunately there's no workaround for the lag yet, other than copying boards in smaller chunks and re-assembling them
Curze#4096: Any tips and tricks on large builds? <[newline]> Load times are increasing and the lag is real when copying boards
HomelikeBrick42#1173: to synchronize what?
Deleted User#0000: Isn't the clock cycle a way to synchronize?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: having clock cycles seems like a major overcomplication
HomelikeBrick42#1173: then each instruction could have its own time that it takes in ticks
HomelikeBrick42#1173: if i was designing a cpu the cpus wiring would just go do the stuff it needed to do and then go back to the begining of the loop (back to the load instruction step)
HomelikeBrick42#1173: why do computers need clock cycles?
circuitgamer77#0377: [16].[16] is an option I was considering...
Verlio_H#0201: or like 16.16 that is something that I find myself doing
Verlio_H#0201: ye prolly
Verlio_H#0201: idk if there is any standard terms for where the radix is located in a fixed point number but when refering to cpus and stuff I like to use the terms "half-half" and "word-word" to refer to the 2 ways of doing it. half-half being where half of the word is fraction other half integer (like 1000.1100 in 8 bits). word-word where you use 1 word for each (like 10001000.01100100 in 8 bits, fraction being a separate word of memory)
circuitgamer77#0377: Could I say something like  "a 32 bit number with 16 bits in the integer part and 16 bits in the fractional part"?
Verlio_H#0201: yeah it wasn't but I was just pointing that out cause it makes talking about it less confusing
PseudoGoose#2841: But I don't think that's the original question
Verlio_H#0201: yeah
PseudoGoose#2841: Technically "radix point" is a more generic term for "decimal point" that doesn't assume your base
Verlio_H#0201: decimal point is called radix in binary
Attikitty#2900: i'm saying if you added more i don't think it would work
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you could add more
Attikitty#2900: wouldn't that only work for only 3 inputs though?
circuitgamer77#0377: Are there standardized names for common positions?  I'm just thinking it would look a bit messy to use that notation everywhere...
StartForKiller#0001: it's a bit different, but it's pretty the same
StartForKiller#0001: so the positions is 1/10^(decimal count)
StartForKiller#0001: then the scale is 1/100
StartForKiller#0001: if you represent 0,01 as 001
StartForKiller#0001: then it's called scaling
StartForKiller#0001: okay
circuitgamer77#0377: Maybe the notation is the same though, I don't know.
circuitgamer77#0377: That's for floating point though - I'm using fixed point.
StartForKiller#0001: the 10^-5 is the decimal point
StartForKiller#0001: so for example 3.4*10^-5
StartForKiller#0001: for example in floating point you have a number in scientific term
StartForKiller#0001: that's called the scientific term
Saltypretzel#0321: Usually people just call it fixed or floating point I think
Jimmy#8080: hmm I don't know if there's a name for that... maybe you get to coin the term!
circuitgamer77#0377: I meant the specific name for where the point is placed...
Jimmy#8080: fixed-point packed decimal?
circuitgamer77#0377: What's the naming for where a decimal point is placed in a binary number?  My current trig calculator is using signed 32 bits with the decimal point exactly in the middle but I don't know what that's called...
Jimmy#8080: remove half the ram from your pc
_Mpcs#0525: Are there ways to reduce ram/cpu usage of the game other than the ingame settings?
n8#4816: thanks!
n8#4816: right
DADp#7461: so you dont have to worry about signals going all over the place
DADp#7461: but it allows for a output
n8#4816: ohh okay
Ecconia#4929: Its a diode
DADp#7461: just buffers the signal
n8#4816: interesting. I'm new to circuit design and the game. what does a buffer do?
DADp#7461: connect pegs to buffers then put the buffers to another peg
DADp#7461: you dont *really* need an or gate
n8#4816: it would be really useful to have an OR gate
n8#4816: is there a reason there arent more logic gates apart from XOR, AND, and NOT in the game?
cheese3660#8641: Not yet
Deleted User#0000: can someone gift me logic world pls
CrispyPin#1149: takes one tick like all gates (except fast buffer)
CrispyPin#1149: depends on the circuit, the relay takes a tick to enable/disable (top pin) but when on it is instant
Deleted User#0000: Thanks!
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hold ctrl
Deleted User#0000: How do i put 3 close to each other?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Wait, that won't work
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Oh, perhaps hardwire a control line to the flags input?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I made an alu with Just about every function, Add, Sub, Not, Or, And, Xor, Nor, Nand, Xnor, shl, shr, ashr, rotl, and rotr. And hooked up a register for flags with muxes so I can forward the flag output to non-inverting alu input side, or data bus for push and pop, and send alu output to flag register input. But I wanna know if I can have set and clear functions for individual flags without hardwired control wires for numbers into inverting alu input. Could anyone by chance assist?
TheAffinity#3062: I do not believe so, unless there is a mod for it
zjobke#1742: is it possible to adjust the max board size? I find the limit very frustrating
TheAffinity#3062: Good day.
PseudoGoose#2841: Don't you mean _closed_? 🙃
Pinpoint Townes#4560: thanks =)
Jimmy#8080: <@150174912982548480> Relays take one tick to toggle between open and closed. Once they are open, signals pass through instantly.
Pinpoint Townes#4560: do relays have any tick delay?
Ecconia#4929: Less than 2 ticks per bit? <[newline]> Btw challenge accepted I managed 1 tick per bit with Redstone too. <[newline]> But by physics concept it should be impossible, unless you process two bits at a time. <[newline]> Maybe there is an optimized 5bit decoder for this use case <:bobby_thinking:692790276938399835>
советская луна#1234: Hi everyone, just wondering if there is a way to convert binary to decimal in less then 2 ticks?
blane1257#8086: i havent designed a circuit outside of logic world yet (at least not one specifically *for* logic world) but if i did, it would almost definitely be in diagram.io, and probably as an abstract block diagram or something.. its something ive done in the past, and honestly i'd reccomend designing systems in diagram.io or a similar editor.. not only is it great to reference in the future, but ive found it helps me think about problems.. and also it makes you feel like a big shot lol, making fancy diagrams and whatnot
TheAffinity#3062: Thanks for mentioning circuitverse. It has an option to learn logic design on it.
TheAffinity#3062: On a completely different topic from wires, the list of servers I see. Do these servers allow people who are new at circuit design just to come in and look. not touch? You know, for getting pointers on how to properly lay down wires? Gee, looks like it wasn't a completely different topic after all.
TheAffinity#3062: I suck at organizing wires. 😦
Safety Skull#8823: I use pen and paper haha
Ecconia#4929: <#905378240338726942>
Sky_Hawk0#3287: im doing it with my calculator, I made the circuit in circuitverse then im making the display in the game. I was wondering if it was a common thing
Dragon Lord#6944: i've done it in the past...
Sky_Hawk0#3287: are there people here that make their circuits on a logic gate builder (like circuitverse) then build it in the game?
RyanT#1426: so static RAM
HomelikeBrick42#1173: its just a demux and a bunch of registers
HomelikeBrick42#1173: i have no idea what type of ram im making
HomelikeBrick42#1173: 256 bytes
RyanT#1426: how much? and delay line or static RAM
HomelikeBrick42#1173: ik
RyanT#1426: pegs are instant
RyanT#1426: ok
HomelikeBrick42#1173: ram
HomelikeBrick42#1173: i had to put another peg in the middle
RyanT#1426: what are u making?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: well i got to that limit
RyanT#1426: yes, but it's pretty long
HomelikeBrick42#1173: is there a limit to the length of wires?
circuitgamer77#0377: also shift+rotate
SpencerBeige#8582: oh ok thank you 👍
HomelikeBrick42#1173: it changes between horizontal and vertical
HomelikeBrick42#1173: use t aswell
SpencerBeige#8582: Sometimes I can't get it back; I have a vertical board and, when I grab it, it switches to a horizontal board with all the components on the bottom.
HomelikeBrick42#1173: use q and e to rotate the board
ieee 802.11ac#6337: that's not a bug, just rotate the board to the wanted direction
SpencerBeige#8582: Has anyone else experience a bug where you grab a board and it flips to a different orientation? Any solution?
berry#1313: shiiii thank you
HomelikeBrick42#1173: use control + middle click on a placed block
berry#1313: is there a way to color items in your hotbar? like how you can do after placing it?
Elperson#8844: Thanks
HomelikeBrick42#1173: 
Elperson#8844: Yeah...  <[newline]> ...right
HomelikeBrick42#1173: google?
Elperson#8844: Does anyone know a good resource for learning about logic gates and etc.?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: i will add more ram later <[newline]> but is there a more compact way?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: is there a more efficient way of having 16 bytes of ram?
Kesuaheli 2#5868: Does anyone know which font is used in LW?
CrispyPin#1149: oh right
DanielGJ44#4557: (also, the answer is this channel's pinned message)
DanielGJ44#4557: Don't forget the end quote
CrispyPin#1149: `server "simulation.rate 10"` in the console
Operu#6600: how to set simulation speed
Infini#5724: IP for whisper's server?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: wait I figured it out
Sky_Hawk0#3287: yeah I kinda guessed
Broyojo#2667: the output is the fat square thing
Broyojo#2667: input to it is the long thin thing
TheAffinity#3062: Okay, I can't run the wires inside a cramped space. I'll need to run the "logic guts" outside of the box and thread them in using holes.
Sky_Hawk0#3287: I'll try it with a delayer but I still don't know what im doing
Broyojo#2667: if this is what you are talking about
Broyojo#2667: they allow signals to only go in one direction
Broyojo#2667: the repeater-like components in the game are the delayer and the buffer
Sky_Hawk0#3287: I know how an inverter works im using them
TheAffinity#3062: Ohhhh, okay
Broyojo#2667: inverter has 1 output (the square thing on the left) and 1 peg input
Sky_Hawk0#3287: like in a call
Broyojo#2667: 
TheAffinity#3062: vc?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: im going to have to do this through vc i dont understand this
Broyojo#2667: they behave as normal pegs
Broyojo#2667: they sort of have individual "pegs" as their inputs
Broyojo#2667: peg components are like this
Broyojo#2667: 
Broyojo#2667: so in this case when one wire turns on the other wire will turn on if that wire is connected to another peg component, not an output block
Broyojo#2667: 
Sky_Hawk0#3287: I dont even understand
Sky_Hawk0#3287: ok
Broyojo#2667: I cannot sadly
Broyojo#2667: it matters that the other end of the wire is connectes to
Sky_Hawk0#3287: wanna join a vc
Broyojo#2667: if you are talking about two wires connected to any peg then this is impossible
Sky_Hawk0#3287: it didn't
Broyojo#2667: buffer should also work
Sky_Hawk0#3287: does that work?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: the relay
Sky_Hawk0#3287: found it
Sky_Hawk0#3287: no so I have a peg that has two wires connected to it. one gets powered, the other gets powered I want something thats like the repeater from minecraft
TheAffinity#3062: It went both ways along the same wire?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: the buffer didn't stop the signal from going the wrong way
wowogiengen#0738: normally they are 1 device width apart
wowogiengen#0738: try placing a smal socket, that is only 1/2 grid wide
TheAffinity#3062: I'm using a Canadian keyboard so it might have something to do with it. It has French accents on it.
wowogiengen#0738: i did not change keybindings...
TheAffinity#3062: Hmmm, control click and click by itself seems to behave the same way on placement with my keyboard configuration
wowogiengen#0738: press ctrl while placing them
wowogiengen#0738: i found it
wowogiengen#0738: ah
wowogiengen#0738: but i dont know how he did it
wowogiengen#0738: 
wowogiengen#0738: i have one here
wowogiengen#0738: yes
TheAffinity#3062: You mean like on the circuit board?
wowogiengen#0738: how can you align elements between the grid?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: oh yeah I don't think I mentioned that the inputs are 1,2,4 and 8?
wowogiengen#0738: unless we can get some integrated circuits it will be very difficult
TheAffinity#3062: Truth tables are easy. Binary maths is hard 😮
Sky_Hawk0#3287: how so?
wowogiengen#0738: binary logic is so complicated
Sky_Hawk0#3287: I'll let you know
TheAffinity#3062: When you get the maths part working let me know. I am still trying to understand how the logic of an adder works.
Sky_Hawk0#3287: wow, I have some programming experience as well so I think that helps with problem solving. I'm wanting to make a calculator, but currently I'm making a 7-segment display
TheAffinity#3062: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2646125907
TheAffinity#3062: I have programming experience which translates to the logic gates but that's it. I'm trying to make a programmable billboard.
Sky_Hawk0#3287: what are you making?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: ye u too
TheAffinity#3062: Me too. Hope you have as much fun as I am right now learning through experimentation. 🙂
Sky_Hawk0#3287: thanks
Sky_Hawk0#3287: oh ok im new to this game and circuits in general lol
TheAffinity#3062: Buffer? It acts like a one way street
Sky_Hawk0#3287: how do I stop a signal going down the wrong wire?
TheAffinity#3062: As to my question about crammed space when laying wire, I could always run the wire outside in the open and put holes in the box to run them into
Sky_Hawk0#3287: yeah, this is gonna get complicated. I want to make a calculator. So I thought I would start with a 7-segment display
CrispyPin#1149: yes but you need some more logic to make it adressable etc
Sky_Hawk0#3287: ok that makes so much sense
TheAffinity#3062: or a pixel
Sky_Hawk0#3287: so 8 of them together is a byte
CrispyPin#1149: yes
CrispyPin#1149: the stored value is always outputted through the output peg
Sky_Hawk0#3287: so its memory
Sky_Hawk0#3287: oh ok
CrispyPin#1149: activating the top input will store the value of the side peg
Sky_Hawk0#3287: I still don't understand sorry
TheAffinity#3062: I believe that's a known issue, but I need to look in that channel.
TheAffinity#3062: I'd like some suggestions on how to lay down wire in a confined space. I'm finding I intersect previously placed components and pins and also it's hard to keep track of what wire runs to what (maybe colouring wire using keyboard x might help as a future upgrade suggestion).
wowogiengen#0738: <@!527420478302715914> my game crashes frequently when i am trying to delete multiple selected parts at once
CrispyPin#1149: buffer and fast buffer are diodes, fast buffer is instant
CrispyPin#1149: oracle has a 50% chance of turning on when powered
CrispyPin#1149: d latch is like a real d latch, with input on the side and write and output on top
Sky_Hawk0#3287: so what does a D latch, Oracle Relay Buffer and fast buffer do? is there like a documentation?
CrispyPin#1149: grab it then delete
CrispyPin#1149: and you can push the simulation rate into the 100kHz range if you don't have too much going on
CrispyPin#1149: but compared to like minecraft you can get very far
CrispyPin#1149: it's limited by loading times and client lag while building, the simulation itself can handle alot
wowogiengen#0738: does the game really have no lag with huge creations and lots of connections?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: ok thank you
CrispyPin#1149: the algorithm you need is called double dabble but i don't know how it works
Sky_Hawk0#3287: ok cos I have made the screen and things but I wanted to make it so I could but in a binary input so like 00101000 (40) and it would display 40
CrispyPin#1149: idk if anyone has made an explanation, but yes. theres probably a few in <#901195561980543007>
CrispyPin#1149: storing them in rom is easier
Operu#6600: should you store instructions in ram or rom generally?
Sky_Hawk0#3287: this is probably a stupid question, but has anyone made a seven segment display?
Bolver#3230: <@!154964593397989376> We could also notice similar problems when two people customize the same object etc.
Bolver#3230: No the Probem occurs with us always after a few minutes on the map out os sync runs e.g. my colleague sees objects that do not exist and if I then or he interacts with such things crashes the game and this person can explicitly no longer enter this map :(. When we create a new world the problem is gone. Is only a little annoying because he can now no longer enter my world where I have built 7std.
Stenodyon#8192: There are two ways ISAs go that I know of: <[newline]> - Variable length instructions, where you can have an full word after the instruction word for the immediate value like the x86 <[newline]> - The immediate value is in the instruction, so it is smaller than a register, but the instruction has a shift parameter applied to the value, this way a register can be fully loaded with two (or more depending on the architecture) instructions like the ARM instruction set
ParSec#5739: Can you bind it to key
Jimmy#8080: Correct <@211188784803348482> , open the console with the `~` key and type `noclip`
commander of the pandas#1576: …how do you noclip? You use console right?
commander of the pandas#1576: I need to get inside my circuit box
commander of the pandas#1576: Yes sorry I’m new
CrispyPin#1149: there is noclip if thats what you want
commander of the pandas#1576: Is there a spectator mode?
Jimmy#8080: Sounds like the auth servers were down, did it start working later? Either way, sounds like a question for <@128545421579517952>
Jimmy#8080: use the command `server stats.world`
HomelikeBrick42#1173: so the instruction would take up 2 words
HomelikeBrick42#1173: you would have the first word for the instruction and then a second word for the data
parallacks#7542: I've got a question. If you're working with a 16 bit ISA and 16 bit registers, there no way to fully load a register with data right? Because part of the data would be used for op code and register address? I'm super new to this low level hardware and programming so I'm just trying to wrap my head around all this.
Bolver#3230: Hey, me and my colleague have a problem when he tries to connect to my server it says only in the console "approving connection" but after a certain time the login aborts. Can anyone help?
LFFB#5600: you could also try to improve the size
LFFB#5600: you could add more stuff to add reset capability or something but this should be enough for most things
LFFB#5600: just having a loop of d-latches and a 1-tick pulse to enable should be enough, also a lever for starting the circuit
Infini#5724: how do i make  aring counter
101#1688: I'd never noticed that! Thanks 🙂
101#1688: Huh
LFFB#5600: you first need to select the world too
LFFB#5600: on the world select menu there is a “component count” on the lower right
101#1688: Any quick ways to count components in a world?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Anyone got any good references for learning how to implement port io? I got a serial transmitter and reciever made. But that's it.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Are there any advantages over using that for toggle over a d flip-flop toggle, besides the obvious difference in dimensions?
SpencerBeige#8582: yoooo thank you
Ecconia#4929: Grab it, delete grabbed. <[newline]> **G** -> **R**
SpencerBeige#8582: So is there no good way to delete a whole board right now?
OopsieDoopsie#0412: pog this is cool
ryyst#1657: even tho this thing is probably like the simplest thing you guys could make...
ryyst#1657: being a total noob this way of making "modules" with sockets is an awesome way to learn :D
Ecconia#4929: That also needs a monostable, this one is smaller
101#1688: That seems more complicated than it needs to be. I just use an and gate + inverter.
ryyst#1657: oh wow this thing just works right away, so simple and nice! thank you again!
Ecconia#4929: Yeah you should know them, but its simple. Every component needs exactly 1 tick. <[newline]> Exceptions: Fast-Buffer and (relay-throughput, relay toggle time is 1-tick again)
ryyst#1657: Cool! Ok! Are the individual module tick rates something you just kinda have to know in LW, or something more generally applicable in electronics?
Ecconia#4929: the buffer just makes up for the delay. <[newline]> Cause Inverter->Relay is 2 ticks. Without the buffer you get a 2-tick pulse. With a 1-tick pulse
ryyst#1657: ohhh alright, and I'm guessing that regular buffer is critical to turning the signal into 1 tick?
Ecconia#4929: Oh wait, here is an image, I stole from another group: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901533340925038592/905869031708434432/Screenshot_2021-11-04_111951.png
ryyst#1657: _Nice!_ Thank you!
Ecconia#4929: "monostable" and "1-tick"
ryyst#1657: yeah any examples (or keywords to search) would be greatly appreciated!
ryyst#1657: ohh right ok :D
Ecconia#4929: I cannot make a screenshot, nor build - since I am joining my server
ryyst#1657: ohh hmm! and yeah turning the button signal into a pulse was something I had in mind but couldn't get around to tackling yet... but what do you mean with the last part of "still joining"? 🤔
Ecconia#4929: You can use an XOR gate, connected to itself. But you need to shorten the button pulse downto 1 tick. That is a different circuit (Still joining, so can't build them)
ryyst#1657: this is my current progress of just trying everything I can think of together :(
ryyst#1657: ok next question; any advice for a circuitry noob on how to approach a "toggle button"? Ie. I want a single button to toggle a lamp on/off, but not sure if I'm way over my head here... just no idea what kind of mechanisms should I even google and such
ryyst#1657: ohhh I have to grab it, roger, thanks! 🙏
Reese4221#8317: grab it and hit r
ryyst#1657: is there a way to delete an entire board full of components at once? my random copies start piling up 👀
Deleted User#0000: Is it possible to change the high signal color? This red triggers my eyes.
Deleted User#0000: How do i connect multiple wires for ins and outs? i know i can select one side with ctrl & mark & left click but when i choose the other side, every wire get connected to 1 pin¿ Edit: i got it, doing the same thing also on the other side.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Not yet that I know of
Ecconia#4929: It shouldn't, mind sending an image?
SpencerBeige#8582: Is there a way to make an instant carry adder that's instant on the falling and rising edges? My adder does all the carries instantly when I flip the Cin on, but it's slow when I turn it off
HomelikeBrick42#1173: is there a way to merge circuit boards?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: thanks
CrispyPin#1149: you can hold control while placing some components to be more precise
HomelikeBrick42#1173: and pegs not aligned to the grid
HomelikeBrick42#1173: ive seen some builds with components very close together
HomelikeBrick42#1173: how do you place things not on the grid
bejoscha#0284: Grab it, then delete
AMOGUS#1535: lol i thougt it was a lamp lol thx
HomelikeBrick42#1173: thanks
Stenodyon#8192: you can grab it with g then delete it with r
HomelikeBrick42#1173: its in the third column of the inventory
AMOGUS#1535: where do i find it
HomelikeBrick42#1173: display panels
AMOGUS#1535: how do you make a screen?
HomelikeBrick42#1173: how do i delete a circuit board with suff on it?
cheese3660#8641: Do the blocks in components share renderers?
alion02#1973: put the pegs behind the buffers
Saltypretzel#0321: How do singer volumes exactly work? are they additive, like if two singers at 100% turn on, is it 200% volume??? when does the adding stop/reach a peak
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: I need a way of connecting these pegs to their corresponding functions with some overlap which wont cause the whole thing to break down as the signal just goes backwards
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: how to prevent something like this?
PseudoGoose#2841: It is a bug, 2-tick delayers _should_ require a pulse of at least 2 ticks for the output to turn on. Same for any n-tick delayer
AMOGUS#1535: #2 is the list cuz its just 2 thing out of 10
CrispyPin#1149: end of list
CrispyPin#1149: #1 that message
AMOGUS#1535: *TOP 10 USELESS THINGS COMPILATION STARTS*
TheAffinity#3062: Okay, thank you 🙂
Ecconia#4929: That is very likely a bug. I reported that already.
AMOGUS#1535: how do i make a screen
Coosh#6149: When copying circuits is there a way to have the bit state preserved? (So things like an SR Latch, do not go haywire)
CrispyPin#1149: how do i set up command bindings in autoexec.lsf? is it possible yet?
Michael#8718: I don't understand why delays of 2 propagate a single pulse, but delays of 3 do not.  For example, a push button hooked to a 3 tick delay doesn't seem to ever go high after button is pushed.
pipe01#7194: The plan for the immediate future is to enable the "open in-game" button, which will automatically open the world in your game without having to manually download and extract it
CrispyPin#1149: and the fast buffer is instant
CrispyPin#1149: it's a diode
CrispyPin#1149: that's the plan
bejoscha#0284: Output pegs (the large flat pegs) also block signals, i.e. only allow it to go away from it. (That's why you cant connect two of them directly)
The last standn#4945: Don't know for 100% if there isnt another way to do it, but that's the only way I know of
The last standn#4945: quite possibly
HomelikeBrick42#1173: so i need a buffer for every connection to the display?
The last standn#4945: You can use buffers to create one-way power
HomelikeBrick42#1173: im trying to make a 7 segment display but the power keeps going backwards and powering all of the wires
HomelikeBrick42#1173: how do you create an or gate that doesnt let power go backwards?
ma meeshka mow skwoz#9120: will the things posted on the logicworld.net hub have functionality comparable to what steam workshop has? e.g. you can click-to-add something from the list and it'll automatically be installed to the game directory appear ingame, as opposed to having to download each world individually and unzip manually like it is right now
Ecconia#4929: I am pretty sure you need one newline for each entry: <[newline]> <https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/SUCC/wiki/Collection-Types#array> <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> Admin_IDs: <[newline]>   - BlaA <[newline]>   - BlaB <[newline]> ```
katkosmos#6502: What's the syntax for the admins list in the server configuration? I'd assume player names are provided in quotes, but are they space separated, comma separated, comma + space separated, etc? <[newline]>  <[newline]> E.g. <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> Admin_IDs: "Foo" "bar" <[newline]> ``` vs ``` <[newline]> Admin_IDs: "Foo", "bar" <[newline]> ``` etc
Nik#1011: 
Nik#1011: my first message about this was pinned to <#401255675264761868>  before this channel was created, so imma re-pin
Nik#1011: yep! for the default 30 TPS, in the console type: <[newline]> `server "simulation.rate 30"`
Coosh#6149: oooh I would love that put it on my nomad cluster ❤️
pipe01#7194: Yeah, we want to release the server on docker very soon so that you can set it up quickly without messing with steam
Ecconia#4929: <@&403335614671486977> this question above is for you :) <[newline]> Personally I would append to that question, if it will be possible to verify the purchase on the LogicWorld account.
Coosh#6149: For the dedicated server it requires you to own the game, is there plans to allow anyone to run the server? (issues are having an automatically updating server I need to deal with 2 factor auth on steamcmd in linux)
ᴍᴏɴᴏ物#1734: is it possible to change the simulation speed ingame?
pilonpl#4015: Probably because the want to "balance" the game
parallacks#7542: dang
CrispyPin#1149: you can't
parallacks#7542: Is there a way to put an xor on its side like this but without the second board?
Deleted User#0000: Exactly!
TheAffinity#3062: I've read references to what is referred to as an adder in the Logic World Steam forums. I'm assuming that is a calculator that uses binary math for calculations, like 00000011 (3) + 00001001 (9) = 00001100 (12)?
parallacks#7542: 👍  Ok cool good to know
PseudoGoose#2841: Sockets don't affect simulation performance (at least I haven't noticed any effects). But if you spam them everywhere, especially busses with a large number of bits, it is easy to make the size of the save file significantly bigger, and that might affect loading times. (One specific example: I made a 96 bit bus module and stacked it 32 times, and that added ~6000 components and inflated world size from 1.7MB to 2.1MB) <[newline]> So if you can wire it up using multiwire and a bit of manual peg placement, that might be better in some cases.
ElNico56#0201: how
ElNico56#0201: 
parallacks#7542: Is there a performance impact from using sockets over wiring pegs? Like if I were copying a module a ton of times and was using sockets instead of pegs to connect between them make a significant difference?
Deleted User#0000: NVM, i got it, you can actually resize the display visually.
Deleted User#0000: When you put the normal display port on the ground, it resizes himself into 2x2 port, when resizing it larger. Maybe the sticking display port should also resize himself visualy.
IsCoffeeTho#0001: a good instance of the challenge is shown with the two "buffers", the instant buffer is bigger because its a trade off
blane1257#8086: thats the point between a lot of the choices jimmy made with this game, he makes things difficult on purpose, makes us make compromises and throws challenges towards us.. the point is to stir up creativity and innovation
blane1257#8086: thats intentional, obviously.. i think the idea is to have a significant trade-off for using higher input counts
Deleted User#0000: Shouldn't the pins move away from the board? When I try to put 2 display ports next to each other (with 9 bit), the connection pins overlap.
Caderikor#6717: <@!154964593397989376> Is it intended that all dll files are expose for anyone to modify the game files?
ElNico56#0201: Uhm
ElNico56#0201: I
CrispyPin#1149: how would you control it in lw
CrispyPin#1149: the whole point of a theremin is that its an analog signal
ElNico56#0201: <@154964593397989376> is this a suggestions channel too? Anyways, please add theremin as an instrument
bejoscha#0284: Buffers, Fast Buffers and OR gates
bejoscha#0284: <@!703982038344138803> Be aware that this OR "gate" does not prevent signals from going the wrong direction. If you need to prevent this, you have to use a Buffer (Or Fast Buffer) - at least this is my current understanding.
OopsieDoopsie#0412: oooh i c, ty
circuitgamer77#0377: Connecting boards together without needing to run wires.  When they are put pointing at each other they connect
OopsieDoopsie#0412: what are sockets for? couldnt really understand their purpose from a first glance
Riku#9814: I just saw a video on the official youtube channel and I'm curious if different world types are still planned. They look cool! \:D
circuitgamer77#0377: That's what I was thinking, I just wanted someone else to confirm :)
Nik#1011: there's lots of cases in hardware (especially retro stuff) where if you get some result for free, someone somewhere will find a use for it
circuitgamer77#0377: It just requires one extra wire per bit, but I need to figure out where to put the socket.
Nik#1011: idk if that necessitates an extra register or anything though
Nik#1011: yeah I'd definitely return the remainder
circuitgamer77#0377: Returning the remainder as a second output implicitly is the faster option
circuitgamer77#0377: It's how any hardware would interface with it - it's a completely independent processor.
Nik#1011: also, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying returning the remainder implicitly is the computationally faster option? or is it the slower one?
Nik#1011: hmm.. is this going to have any kind of UI to the user or is this just how programs would interface with the processor
The last standn#4945: nvm ```server "help"``` showed the rest
The last standn#4945: Wait, the command isn't listed in the "help" list, are there more hidden commands?
circuitgamer77#0377: Different question: Should I make my division/multiplication processor return the remainder implicitly, or should I just return the quotient and have the user calculate the remainder by multiplying then subtracting?  It more than doubles the time for that calculation, but it saves an input.  I'm probably going to return the remainder anyway, but it would be good to know the likely use cases.
circuitgamer77#0377: confused me too :)
The last standn#4945: ahhhh I didn't know i needed the "server" part in front <[newline]> thank you
circuitgamer77#0377: 30tps by default, command is: `server "simulation.rate [tps]"`
The last standn#4945: What is the tickrate of the game? And how can I change it? <[newline]> Looking through the devlogs there is one where the tickrate is changed, but the command seems to either be outdated or hidden. <[newline]> Also tried using the "help" command in console, but just got confused.
Funky Egg#5652: No
FinnyBc#1852: is it possible to save boards yet?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: For loading external files, I think mods are the way, and what about a block where you edit it and enter the file name, and it would load it.
cheese3660#8641: I have some ideas for sometjing like that
Ecconia#4929: I think it would be good to have a client-sided mod, which is able to flick some levers to match some input file. Someone who does <#901659878869844048> please bless us
cheese3660#8641: Maybe have roms have an insane delay, like 10 ticks? But still pipelineable
Stenodyon#8192: I think if he can't do it he'll add ROM components, but I think it's a good choice to try and optimize the game first
cheese3660#8641: Also I dont like making huge repetetive structures myself but thats just me
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: it is know how it would sorta work? because im dumb
cheese3660#8641: I still dont see that feasible toooooo far
Stenodyon#8192: Actually Jimmy said today he was debating adding a ROM component, he'd like to optimize the game to allow building massive ROMs
Verlio_H#0201: jimmy said will add rom but wont add ram prolly
cheese3660#8641: ROM is being debated on and leaning towards no, RAM idk
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I'd like to know what the official stance is on mitigating the problems associated with large amounts of memory. By that I mean part count and performance issues related to it? Are there plans to add rom and ram modules? Cause that's the most sensible solution I can think of. They could be gigantic blocks to mimic the volume consumption, while removing thousands upon thousands of the blocks that would otherwise be used. The only other way I can think of would be extensive use of optimization techniques like instancing, which, it would be cool to be able to copy and paste 512 bytes of RAM without crushing the frame rate, but what about a Megabyte? Or is that too much memory for the official purpose of the game?
LFFB#5600: but as blane said you are probably also using it as a relay. so you can just use a relay or an and gate
LFFB#5600: tri-state is only used in real life to not short circuit stuff, in a game like this there is no need for tri-state logic
blane1257#8086: relay is slightly faster sometimes (it takes a tick to switch, but when on it acts as a 0-tick wire) but its obviously bigger and also allows signals to go backwards through it
blane1257#8086: and gate or relay, pretty much yeah
Agent Blue#6258: Hey everyone! So i see people building memory and started looking into creating addressable memory banks. I think i get most of it however, on the outputs of the the logic diagram im looking at has Tri-State Buffers. In this game, is a tri state buffer essentially an and gate?
Red_3D#3062: some people just want to watch the world burn
Verlio_H#0201: sad
ElNico56#0201: sad
Red_3D#3062: they are not
ElNico56#0201: 👀
Verlio_H#0201: are all of the error messages on localizer as well?
Jimmy#8080: I'm so glad to hear that <:bobby:628326527817220106>

Jimmy#8080: <@703982038344138803>
ElNico56#0201: Because i bought two copies of the game, now i gave jimmy more money than the average player, and yall are now bellow average
ElNico56#0201: a single peg
dan__#2324: hi im new here, is there any or gate?
ElNico56#0201: sneaky jimmy
ElNico56#0201: he wants me to buy another copy
Jimmy#8080: The Buffer is intended for your general buffering needs, while the Fast Buffer is intended for when you're doing advanced fast stuff and you NEED the buffering to be instant.
Jimmy#8080: My goal when designing LW is always to maximize the possibility-space, and create as many interesting scenarios as I can. By making you trade speed for size, I'm adding an additional dimension to consider when you're designing circuits. <[newline]> With regards to the new Buffer in particular: the primary feature of this component is that it has an output peg instead of an input peg. Peep:
cheese3660#8641: Jimmy, why is your bio sus
Dragon Lord#6944: He use third person pronouns to describe himself too
cheese3660#8641: Lol, your theme is great tho

ElNico56#0201: Show me your ways
ElNico56#0201: Theme
ElNico56#0201: Is that
ElNico56#0201: What
Moldytzu#4226: thx
Stenodyon#8192: quick video to demonstrate
Moldytzu#4226: can you explain the steps, please? I don't understand how
Stenodyon#8192: I use it all the time
ElNico56#0201: Does it work?
ElNico56#0201: That sounds hacky as hell
Stenodyon#8192: yup, select pegs 1 to n-1, and connect to pegs 2 to n
Moldytzu#4226: I don't have enough space
ElNico56#0201: You can just use sockets to ease copy pasting right?
Moldytzu#4226: can't that be used to draw a wire that connects multiple pegs?
Moldytzu#4226: like there is the mod key
Moldytzu#4226: is there a way to connect a line of pegs very fast?
Red_3D#3062: if you link your discord account to localizor, you will be given the translator role by the developer once they see that you are serious about it.
ElNico56#0201: translation work takes hours and hours my guy
ElNico56#0201: bruh
AMOGUS#1535: i am doing it for like 10 min
ElNico56#0201: i don't think you get it for translating one sentence
AMOGUS#1535: how do i get my purple name in discord for translating
AMOGUS#1535: yes
ElNico56#0201: It's nice to see the game spreading to so many places, since the devs are english speaking
AMOGUS#1535: why nice
ElNico56#0201: Why what
AMOGUS#1535: why
ElNico56#0201: Nice
ElNico56#0201: Hungarian
AMOGUS#1535: hungary
ElNico56#0201: Hey <@770375927691345980> what's your native language?
AMOGUS#1535: lol i am translating
Red_3D#3062: <https://www.localizor.com/logic-world>
AMOGUS#1535: how do i help translate?
AMOGUS#1535: how do i make a screen
bejoscha#0284: For some elements I couldn't use Q or E when being placed (even if there is space), you have to grab it, rotate it, and place it down. (I consider this a bug)
AMOGUS#1535: or gates
AMOGUS#1535: will they add ir gatesM
Moldytzu#4226: the 'Q' key is my friend
Moldytzu#4226: I can only place it in one direction
Moldytzu#4226: how do I rotate a gate?
pilonpl#4015: i think people prioritize speed over size so it only makes circuits bigger
bejoscha#0284: <:thenking:446109302369812490> Does this make sense in a sandbox type gain? Why penalize the use of *any* component? Is this also the reason why the new Buffer is 1-tick?  <[newline]> I would like to hear a bit of **your** reasoning behind the Buffer / Fast Buffer elements in the game, as I'm honestly confused by them.
Jimmy#8080: Balance. It's a very powerful component so it should have some drawbacks.
JC Denton#9567: By the way why did the fast buffer turn out to be so big? 😃
Jimmy#8080: Yep, that was an early demo of what became Fast Buffers
JC Denton#9567: Without this I can't do a counter for microinstructions 😦
JC Denton#9567: I need help doing a counter that  <[newline]> 1. gets incremented only when a clock input enters the first cell (so far I've only done ICA build that increments on its own) <[newline]> 2. carries instantly so that there are no values between correct values <[newline]> Somebody tried to help me with this but I didn't manage to do it
JC Denton#9567: Are these in game yet? Buffers?
JC Denton#9567: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd77GpK-Zw
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but yeah, considering the component count is a concern, I'm curious why the small delayer exists
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it's unique form might come in handy in compacting circuits (as an alternative to an AND-gate with both inputs tied together, or a 1-tick delayer)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i guess... a 1-tick delay? but we have delayers
Michael#8718: Seems like sometimes, propagation delays cause issues.  For example, seemed like an enable line and write line didn't both drop at needed moment of time, so I added a delay element to some logic in my control unit.  How do people synchronize control lines in their CPU control units?
Tigrou#1964: Some sort of "3D LogicSim" I guess 🙂
Stenodyon#8192: Yup, it's a sandbox :) A campaign, and challenges are planned for a future update
Tigrou#1964: I have a question about the game in general : what is the main purpose of it ? <[newline]> Is this like Minecraft which is to build things (logic circuits in this case) with possibility to share things and do it in multiplayer ? <[newline]> Is there a story or puzzle mode ?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I saw a command that might do it in the console help list
Nik#1011: all correct. it is instant. Sockets are useful for swapping boards, but they are especially useful for circuits intended to daisy-chain/stack, like full adders carrying from one unit to the next. I find myself making daisy-chaining circuits more than anything else in LW so sockets are just... essential. (for me)
Lance#8995: I do miss the 555 chip as almost all of my circuits I design at home use one or more of them.
Red_3D#3062: I love how simple and abstract logic world is while allowing you to conveniently make real circuits. In case you'll ever miss a more complex component, modders will probably have your back.
Lance#8995: I have been using chips on a solderless breadboard for years but this program is more basic as it lack any of the 74xx or the 4xxx series of dip chips.  This is OK as the developer explained that this is a game with creativity in mind and advanced chips would detract from that at this point.  It is nice not to have to calculate what resister I need as a load resister for that LED I am placing on the board.
Lance#8995: Now that is an Idea I can get behind.  I was just testing them on the same board and the relevance did not hit me then.  Thanks for the response.
Red_3D#3062: sockets form connections when the blue parts touch and are intended to be used with modular circuits so you dont have to going in there and make each connection yourself after swapping out a part. iirc they are instant.
Lance#8995: I like the program so far but I am wondering what use is the SOCKET?  is it there for a DELAY?
CrispyPin#1149: a bit redundant
CrispyPin#1149: yeah theres now 3 ways to get a 1 tick delay with an output peg
bejoscha#0284: vs. this
bejoscha#0284: 
bejoscha#0284: But then I can have transfer in the wrong direction...
RyanT#1426: no buffers needed
RyanT#1426: just connect the wires
bejoscha#0284: As an aside: Would one now build an OR gate rather as two buffers side by-side, or as two Fast-buffers side-by side? (Or neither?)
bejoscha#0284: I don't doubt that. But why not make it just shorter and (maybe?) have it have an output peg?  <[newline]> Or, the other way around: What is the point of making the new buffer not "fast" ?
cheese3660#8641: Fast buffer is useful af
bejoscha#0284: Thanks. I should rephrase my question: Why have two very similar elements instead of making the "Fast Buffer" shorter and give it an output peg? Jimmy seems to be very concerned about keeping the number of elements low (and I understand why), so this seems a bit out of order. Or, phrasing it differently: If the new Buffer is what most people want, what things *require* a Fast Buffer? And also: Why make the new buffer 1-tick? I just have the feeling I'm missing something, but I have to admit that I'm not well versed in binary logic at all.
blane1257#8086: like theres enable lines along the side for each address
blane1257#8086: i would be okay with it if it had physical size and you need to use an external decoder
blane1257#8086: having an abstract rom component that handles addressing and everything just feels really... meh
blane1257#8086: i just hope it wont be too abstract
blane1257#8086: maybe
cheese3660#8641: Modding a rom component is nigh impossible
cheese3660#8641: At that point, wait for LW to have built in rom component
blane1257#8086: let alone basically impossible once in the KB kinda range
blane1257#8086: that would get really awful at a large scale
cheese3660#8641: I did type them out by hand
blane1257#8086: the labels could also include a rom name/index so you can have multiple roms
blane1257#8086: oop except B cant work for bottom since back exists, but yiu could use whole words ig
blane1257#8086: and the labels would have corner indexes (like `"F","L","B"` for example for the front left bottom corner), and so you could rotate or mirror the the labels however you like to make the indexes (and so addresses) ordered in whatever way you like
blane1257#8086: i think it would be easier to define bounds and then just scan accross in a set pattern (like lect to right, front to back, then top to botton) and give every switch an index as you find them then divide them up into bytes
blane1257#8086: but then youd have to type them all out wouldnt you, that or youd make soemthing that generates the rom automatically or smth
blane1257#8086: labels either side of a byte/word or smth
blane1257#8086: hmm, that could work
cheese3660#8641: I was going to use labels to define the address
blane1257#8086: besides searching for particular patterns of switches lol
blane1257#8086: but im not sure what other way you could figure out what part is the rom and what part isnt
blane1257#8086: if thats possible at least
blane1257#8086: honestly i like the idea of using labels to define the bounds of the ROM, and then different labels for each corner to define the different sides and so which way it scans
blane1257#8086: to be able to use my own assembler and IDE and everything, ugh
blane1257#8086: you shouls def do it, i would use the heck out of it even if it were super inconvenient
cheese3660#8641: For the switch setting that is
cheese3660#8641: I have an idea for it but its kinda hard to do i think
blane1257#8086: and it would find all the switches between those corners
blane1257#8086: would be difficult to figure out what the rom is, maybe it could require that you put labels at the corners with some specific text in them or smth
blane1257#8086: i imagine it hasnt been done yet
blane1257#8086: anyone know if anyone has made a thingy that can set switches so you can write to roms from files?
CrispyPin#1149: no clue if its finished or what and i havent used it
CrispyPin#1149: https://github.com/Pleezon/LWParser
circuitgamer77#0377: Any idea where to find that?  I want to see what that is like even if I can't copy boards :)
CrispyPin#1149: someone (multiple people?) made a program that can convert a save file to json and back i think
circuitgamer77#0377: I have a general idea from the name
circuitgamer77#0377: I do not know how to do that, but it sounds interesting - what would it do?
CrispyPin#1149: maybe using a world parser
circuitgamer77#0377: Anyone know if there's a sneaky way to copy boards between worlds even though board saving isn't ready yet?  I have half of the components for my CPU in one world and half in the other due to a crash that stopped me from joining the first for a while
Vetinari#9152: i didnt know that exists. thanks, i will try it
Red_3D#3062: You can probably download the logic world server on your Linux server through steamcmd
Vetinari#9152: im playing with a friend and were having some issues with the multiplayer; i want to host a server on my own linux server to see if that fixes things, but i only have windows available locally. is there a way to download the linux server files somehow?
LFFB#5600: i can help editing too, i also have a little experience
Leo3065#5297: Is there a list of functions and parts that are currently removed/disabled but planned to be added back?
Ecconia#4929: Just replace the save with a SP save
ᴍᴏɴᴏ物#1734: this might be a dumb question but how do i change which map I host? or how can I generate a new one?
101#1688: Having a latch component with an output enable would also help a lot to bring the part count down. Realistically though, people will probably build the biggest thing the game can handle anyway 🤷‍♂️
Ecconia#4929: Sounds good. I have little experience with video editing. I would love fancy animations. <[newline]> And iterative improving videos are also nice.
IsCoffeeTho#0001: a bunch of videos where we show some concepts of digital circuit
Ecconia#4929: Could you elaborate? <[newline]> Not sure what exactly you mean there.
cheese3660#8641: Yeah, the lack of ram modules is why im making my own, tho ... I kinda got side tracked making an X address bits by Y data bits ram tester
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I was hoping for rom and ram modules with hex input kind of like what's in logisim. Particularly for larger amounts. To make 256 bytes of ram it takes over 1000 blocks. And copying and pasting it nearly kills my pc. It like loads for 5 minutes and the games memory went to 5gigs.
IsCoffeeTho#0001: Who would be interested in making a big community made tutorial series?
Ecconia#4929: It should be okay. But you are right, something is wrong there. <[newline]> I have my whole CPU on a single mount. But even before, when I resized a parent board, all sub-components made clicking connection sounds - which is totally wrong at that point. (So the game does stuff it shouldn't)
LFFB#5600: is it a bad idea to do a whole ram on a single board? cause it seems like every item i place it seems to lags a bit <[newline]> there is probably something im missing because i dont see how just parenting something could cause this much lag
Theodora-chan#3711: oh, i should have told you about my goal first. <[newline]> I'm trying to build a simple 14 digit calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Theodora-chan#3711: wow, that's good. thanks
Ecconia#4929: Will take some time.... to record it. And I want to build a devices showcasing the algorithm first. Cause that is cooler than doing it on paper and recording that.
Theodora-chan#3711: i want a tutorial so bad!
Theodora-chan#3711: The double daddle I did is a method that refers to the top 3 digits of the binary and adds 3(0011) if it is 5(0101) or more, and repeat this process with shifts until the second last digit. it is confusing me even more lol
PseudoGoose#2841: (Also note, you don't need a multiplier. Because `x*10` is the same as `(x << 3) + (x << 1)`)
Theodora-chan#3711: yeah, that's exactly what i tried to do, but i found it a very weird way so i was looking for another method
Ecconia#4929: Instead of like in double dabble doing *2 you do /2 <[newline]> (I really should make a tutorial)
PseudoGoose#2841: One way is to just add the decimal digits from highest to lowest, and between each addition you multiply the accumulated value by ten
Theodora-chan#3711: i mean BCD to binary converter
Theodora-chan#3711: omg i finally couldn't find a way to invert double dobble. there are too few documents in my native language lol <[newline]> can anyone give me some hint, even if it's in English
Dragon Lord#6944: copy and paste in small batches instead of big ones
LFFB#5600: any tips on how to minimize lag? mainly when placing/copying alot of stuff
blane1257#8086: i dont honestly see how it could get less messy <[newline]>  <[newline]> the roms will only replace the switches
Verlio_H#0201: well the way I am refering to is by having like 8 outputs in a row on the ground, and a few spaces back having like 8 switches in a row which each have wires connecting them to which ever outputs they go to, this gets very messy very fast
blane1257#8086: also like.. isnt.. literally everything in this game that way? like thats kinda the point
blane1257#8086: it doesnt really require that many wires though, idk how he couls possibly make it take less wires tbh, besides completely abstracting even the address
blane1257#8086: maybe
Verlio_H#0201: I think part of the reason he is adding rom components is there is really only 1 way to do it compactly, and that involves a lot of wires in small spaces which is just tedious and a mess
blane1257#8086: which is really i think the main thing anyone wants out of a rom component
blane1257#8086: i do prefer that RAMs have to be actually built though.. and i hope that whatever he thinks up for ROMs still requires that you actually build them.. though im not sure how that would work with stuff like loading from binary files
blane1257#8086: hmm i hope he at least does stuff like compressing bools to ints and stuff if he doesnt already do that
blane1257#8086: okay thx
Stenodyon#8192: yes
blane1257#8086: is this hz btw?
Dragon Lord#6944: https://logicworld.net/tracker/127
Dragon Lord#6944: it's a bug
gotenks917#3427: how do i make it so i can edit the timing of a delayer while its connected to something or is that a bug?
PseudoGoose#2841: The new Buffer is shorter and has a "blot" output like the output of most other gates, which means that it won't propagate other signals if multiple wires are connected to it
kcino#4841: Why game doesn't load, I and my friend always see "The game is loading lol"
melonik#8905: if you have axcess to the server console can you give someone else axcess to the command: server?
cheese3660#8641: Logic wolrd compiles the C#
cheese3660#8641: You dont compile anythign yourself
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I don't know what dlls to link or where to put the compiled things.
bejoscha#0284: Is there a way to pre-configure the default hot-bar when starting a new server? It's always the first thing I have to change...
cheese3660#8641: Its actually not too hard
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Oh
cheese3660#8641: A lot of reverse engineering and decompilation of stuff is how its being figured out
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: <@!299685147220115457>  You know how to mod!? I thought the documentation wasn't out yet.
bejoscha#0284: I'm confused by the buffer. Why would one want a Buffer instead of a Fast Buffer? (Also, why are *both* not rotateable with Q or E once placed and need to be grabbed...)
cheese3660#8641: Which is fair
cheese3660#8641: Unless you dont want to mod
cheese3660#8641: For ram, download cheeseutilmod once I finish it more it should be as memory efficient as 1 bit of data == 1 bit of memory used or so
Ecconia#4929: Yes
Logic Alligator#3105: Hi guys, when you are building a binary to BCD do you use the double dable algorith? if so do you create a loop that runs for the same amount of times as the number of input bits?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: K, well thankfully I made a backup of the level, cause copying a tower of 256 bytes took like 5 mins, and after a delete and undo, it seems to have crashed. It was still loading, but the memory dropped from 5gigs go 500 megs, and it was taking forever so I closed it. I'm curious about that memory drop now that I think about it though. Maybe the 5 gigs was more garbage collector that what was needed to run.....
Stenodyon#8192: ROM components are planned, I don't know about RAM
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: are there gonna be memory module blocks eventually? I made a 512 byte memory tower, and the game is using 5gigs of memory, which isn't surprising given all the blocks needed. It'd be pretty nice to have a much lower part count to memory ratio. I'm sure there will be mods, just wondering if any plans for vanilla memory blocks.
alion02#1973: 30
Safety Skull#8823: What’s the default?
captncraig#8603: Anyone got a suitable docker image for dedicated server?
Munashe#3730: Thanks
Stenodyon#8192: `server "simulation.rate n"`
pilonpl#4015: server "simulation.rate 10"
Munashe#3730: What is the command to change simulation speed (tick rate)?
Broyojo#2667: yes also through peg
alion02#1973: useful for making scaleable (tileable) stuff
alion02#1973: socket too
BananaBerry#6140: Ok thanks!
Verlio_H#0201: and peg if you count that as a component
Verlio_H#0201: quick buffer and relay
BananaBerry#6140: Heres a quick one. What components are actually 0 tick? I'm new and the lack of a in game manual for what the hell the components are is throwing me
zjobke#1742: thank u sten
Stenodyon#8192: The <#901659878869844048> channel has resources on modding LW in the pinned messages
melonik#8905: how can i create mod?
Stenodyon#8192: Grab the board and press t to toggle between flat and standing
zjobke#1742: how can I make boards flat to the ground, without having to attach it to a horizontal board?
CrispyPin#1149: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901158328405729371/902187350782795786
CrispyPin#1149: yes
Lisa#4756: Can a server be made into grid map?
Munashe#3730: To force the signal line low
Munashe#3730: I used relays in my wip uart thing
captncraig#8603: yes, but it is also instant to switch if the gate is open, so thats beneficial sometimes.
gotenks917#3427: so the relay is a bad AND gate
IsCoffeeTho#0001: it doesn't seem like there is, bc there are many different designs that have benefits over others. It would depend on the build but most are using ICAs (Instant Carry Adders)
Safety Skull#8823: Have any canonical designs emerged? I feel like I redesign my full adder  every build
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~or just https://logicworld.net/hub~~
DustyAngel47#7299: And then go to `Creation Hub` on the navbar
DustyAngel47#7299: on https://logicworld.net
Michael#8718: So maybe you can download it, on another machine?
DustyAngel47#7299: Yeah it uploads to the creation hub
Michael#8718: I presumed it loads it to some cloud?
circuitgamer77#0377: What does "upload this sandbox" do?
circuitgamer77#0377: a buffer only allows a signal to pass in one direction, and a relay only allows a connection between the two ends if the third pin is on.
gotenks917#3427: what do the buffer and relay do?
CrispyPin#1149: no
circuitgamer77#0377: also, just curious, is it possible to map Mod to Mod+something?
circuitgamer77#0377: (and will it work)
circuitgamer77#0377: Can I join a server on an old version if I update to the new one?
brennan#3276: When resizing a `Panel Display`, how do I get the peg to be centered?  It always sticks to 1 side.
Hugin#2596:

CrispyPin#1149: maybe
CrispyPin#1149: you recieve context
Hugin#2596: What do I do when I clicked "request context" by accident
Hugin#2596: What is it for? where can I find it in game?
Roelke#5009: let me check it again
Roelke#5009: mhhh it should of worked do
Nik#1011: :( I don't think your port forwarding worked
Roelke#5009: connection time out
Nik#1011: what error does your friend get?
Roelke#5009: i gave it to my friend but he still cant connect do
Nik#1011: it's still a valid IP

Roelke#5009: it gives me that long thinhie
Roelke#5009: i did
CrispyPin#1149: just click the link
Roelke#5009: i get like : 48a5:8fg8: and so on (thats not part of my ip its just an example)
CrispyPin#1149: https://whatsmyip.com/
CrispyPin#1149: it should just be 4 numbers with dots separating them
Roelke#5009: right ?
Roelke#5009: its a really long thing with numbers and letters
Roelke#5009: how do i google it ?
CrispyPin#1149: no google what your ip is
Roelke#5009: thats the default gateway one right ?
CrispyPin#1149: public ip right
Roelke#5009: yeah
CrispyPin#1149: do they have your ip?
Roelke#5009: how do i make it so my friend can connect ?
Roelke#5009: but
Roelke#5009: i can see it in my LAN server menu
Roelke#5009: then It said server initialized clients can now connect .
CrispyPin#1149: assuming is running fine
CrispyPin#1149: then you should be able to connect to the dedicated server
Roelke#5009: what I already did is open up the dedicated server app then i forwarded my port
Roelke#5009: so
Roelke#5009: wait I am a complete noob at this stuff
CrispyPin#1149: but you dont need to
CrispyPin#1149: like if you wanted to run the server on a different computer
CrispyPin#1149: the server files
Roelke#5009: what files do you mean ?
CrispyPin#1149: but you can copy the files to somewhere else if you want
CrispyPin#1149: its in steam
CrispyPin#1149: run the logic world dedicated server
Roelke#5009: I really want to host a server for me and my friend but I am getting nowhere I already port fowarded the 43531 port and I am able to set up a working LAN server but not a server my friend can join can somebody help me please
pilonpl#4015: "pasku narzędzi" chyba bliższe angielskiemi znaczeniu
Hugin#2596: Translation to polish: <[newline]> should I translate "Selects slot [n] in the hotbar" as "Wybiera slot [n] w ekwipunku" or "pasku narzędzi" <[newline]> also slot to "miejsce" or "slot"
Ecconia#4929: I will probably at some point at a `Tag-Language` to the game files. Which just has the keys as content. That would be interesting.
Moldytzu#4226: oh
Ecconia#4929: I have not confirmed that. It is just my guess.
Moldytzu#4226: can I upload your message as context?
Moldytzu#4226: thx
Ecconia#4929: That is pretty likely the MOD (Modifier) key. By default `control`. <[newline]> Used in the Keybindings settings window (at least)
Moldytzu#4226: does anybody understand what this should be?
Krzeseło#2988: thx
pilonpl#4015: 30
Krzeseło#2988: what is the basic value of simulation.rate ?
PseudoGoose#2841: `settings_master.succ`
melonik#8905: i remember it also
yot#3606: I remember watching a stream of one of the beta testers, and I remember that there was a hidden mens called "super secret settings" (or something like that at least...) <[newline]> what I'm wondering is if anyone else remembers something like that, or am I just imagining things :P
Saltypretzel#0321: Is there a way to run older LW because sometimes server don’t update
zjobke#1742: does any1 know how I can shrink the board without having to move everything? when I try to move stuff everything breaks, especially with multiselect
Pegacraffft#1193: I didn't try to host an actual server yet, but normaly you obviously should be able to play
Agent Blue#6258: Hey everyone, Just curious about the mp server. can i run the server and the game on the same machine? wehn i start the server up on steam it looks like its starting the game too
Pegacraffft#1193: Yep ^^
zhiayang#0738: yea, that's true. would be nice if this was configurable (:
Pegacraffft#1193: Like otherwise i wouldnt know how to build something like a display.
Pegacraffft#1193: I guess that is true. But like for a display, you should be able to place them next to each other, dont you agree?
zhiayang#0738: i guess both ways kinda have their issues
zhiayang#0738: right, that's what i meant by "except from behind"
Pegacraffft#1193: I didn't really have trouble connecting to each peg
Pegacraffft#1193: Yea sure, but i mean with the long solution you cant actually build a good looking display
zhiayang#0738: i'm guessing that it would be almost impossible to reach the centre peg except from "behind"
RyanT#1426: Jimmy, why did you add the new slower buffer? this acts exactly like a 1 tick delayer
Pegacraffft#1193: I will put that here too, because its actually an question. Why isn't the left layout chosen for the lamp pins... It would be much more convenient
Pegacraffft#1193: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/401255675264761868/904009960587939891/unknown.png?width=607&height=439
CrispyPin#1149: yeah just put 8 bits next to each other and read/write to them at the same time
Limón#7879: idk how exactly ram works
Limón#7879: can you make 1 byte ram from just 1 bit rams chained together
Pegacraffft#1193: Because of server regions. So the Ping and streams are more stable
pilonpl#4015: Why is there a dedicated VC for EU and US xd?
Jimmy#8080: <@108289447799308288> The default simulation speed is 30 ticks per second. If the game renders at less than 30 frames per second, then it's possible for a one-tick pulse to be completely invisible.
JC Denton#9567: nevermind I have connected it to another one, that is probably why
JC Denton#9567: No apparently this pulse shortener won't output at every input
JC Denton#9567: 
JC Denton#9567: If you have got 1 tick pulses is there a possibility that you won't see them happen in lines?
JC Denton#9567: I tried with half adders and latches but it didn't work
JC Denton#9567: back to the question, can I have a 8-bit program counter update in 3 ticks and use a clock to increment it?
JC Denton#9567: if it was every instruction with a 9 tick clock it would be 54 ticks to complete the program
JC Denton#9567: Add memory location 14 and 15 and output to screen in 14 ticks
JC Denton#9567: 
JC Denton#9567: Except that if ALU takes 4 ticks to compute the addition, there should be 1-2 no operations between LDB and ADD
JC Denton#9567: Would require ability to read memory from two locations at once
JC Denton#9567: I came up with a way to compute two instructions in parallel, but it would require two ticks between the start of the instructions
JC Denton#9567: 
JC Denton#9567: something that would start a new instruction every 1 tick but the instruction would take multiple ticks to finish, it would seem to run really fast
JC Denton#9567: Not sure if I got what you meant but this got me thinking about a whole different architecture if that is possible
JC Denton#9567: I don't understand how a compiler has to do anything with this 😮
JC Denton#9567: How do you collect an instruction from memory, increment program counter, change memory address to address in instruction, read memory to B register and then add ALU output to A register at the same time?
JC Denton#9567: I would be fine with a 9 tick clock
JC Denton#9567: Goes above my head 😂
oddron#8955: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_triggered_architecture
oddron#8955: A company called TransMeta designed a VLIW processor, and then they used *software* to transform x86 instructions to VLIW microcode to run on their processor
oddron#8955: True, but you could let your *compiler* generate the required microinstructions. A simple compiler would insert the required number of NOP instructions. A sophisticated compiler might send multiple consecutive additions, one per tick, and collect each result at the appointed time
JC Denton#9567: if one takes 4 ticks you have to wait until moving to the next instruction
JC Denton#9567: like the instruction "Load from memory to register A" would be "Counter out -> Memory address in" "RAM out -> Instruction register in" "Instruction register out -> Memory address in" "RAM out -> Register A in"
JC Denton#9567: But for example you need to have microinstructions which could be add for example, it takes 3 ticks and you should wait for that until you move to the next instruction?
JC Denton#9567: Somebody said it was
oddron#8955: Exactly. That's why I suggested it. If a fully pipelined circuit is possible, then it would have the fastest clock in LW.
JC Denton#9567: sounds hard?
oddron#8955: <@!108289447799308288> Have you considered trying to design fully pipelined circuits that use the tick rate itself as the clock? For example, imagine that on every single tick, you could present a pair of addends to an adder, and (let's say) 3 ticks later the corresponding sum would appear on the outputs.
melonik#8905: ok
JC Denton#9567: but as a challenge and cool results I want to have the fastest clock possible
JC Denton#9567: I could do it easily if it was ok to have clock cycle of 20 or so
melonik#8905: ok
melonik#8905: oh
JC Denton#9567: Just a 8-bit program counter
melonik#8905: maiby i can help you <@!108289447799308288>
melonik#8905: what are you trying to do?
JC Denton#9567: No I am not
JC Denton#9567: Im getting forward
JC Denton#9567: What I am looking for is a program counter that I increment every 4 clock cycles
JC Denton#9567: But the problem is that I can't have the clock stop and then continue one step, it clocks on it's own and bugs out when there is no carry input to the system
JC Denton#9567: Actually I think I've done that
JC Denton#9567: 
PseudoGoose#2841: Right, the memory and the incrementer circuit would be connected in a loop. So the incrementer computes the next state of the memory from its current state
PseudoGoose#2841: Though actually, I think you can make an incrementer with just half adders - one of the inputs in each bit is unused
JC Denton#9567: So have memory that outputs to the incrementer and the incrementer outputs to memory?
JC Denton#9567: Allright, that might take me into the right direction. I am familiar with full adders 🙂
PseudoGoose#2841: 
PseudoGoose#2841: This effect is known as "ripple" - and you've implemented "ripple carry", which is a known and perfectly fine way to make an adder if it fits your timing requirements.  <[newline]> And ripple carry doesn't have to be slow - you can reduce the delay from carry-in to carry-out to just 1 tick, instead of 4. <[newline]>  <[newline]> If you separate the "memory" part from the "computation" part, that will be a step in the right direction. I.e., make an "incrementer" circuit that takes an input x and computes x+1, and then make a separate memory module that connects to the input/output of the incrementer. <[newline]>  <[newline]> To make an incrementer, the circuit you will want for each bit is a "full adder": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#/media/File:Full-adder_logic_diagram.svg
gotenks917#3427: thx
JC Denton#9567: More inputs? Press x
gotenks917#3427: how do i add inputs to and gates?
JC Denton#9567: Actually I mean it needs to have a clock input so it can be incremented only once at a time, not enabled/disabled
JC Denton#9567: I made one that clocked itself and it was too fast
JC Denton#9567: Ecconia showed me instant carry adders but I didn't get how to make a counter with the same principle
JC Denton#9567: The problem is that 11111111 + 1 results in 01111111 00111111 00011111 00001111 00000111 00000011 etc. before stablizing into 00000000
JC Denton#9567: Does somebody know how to make a counter that does not have a slow carry? I designed this by the circuit schematics I found online and it is too slow. I think it takes 4 ticks to pass through one unit and thus a 8-bit counter probably takes 32 ticks to pass and I would like to have it under 14 ticks
Jimmy#8080: Hit F while placing an XOR gate. Or look at a placed XOR gate and press F.
TheAffinity#3062: Though control Z comes in handy to roll back a change
TheAffinity#3062: Aside from not clicking the left button to set the component or assembly down? I am unsure if that is possible.
ArtificialLegacy#1749: is there a way to preview placement ?
Broyojo#2667: no problem
TheAffinity#3062: Again, my thanks.
TheAffinity#3062: scribbling notes
TheAffinity#3062: https://tenor.com/view/writing-pencil-notebook-gif-14839129
Broyojo#2667: yes, they are memory cells
TheAffinity#3062: Thank you! This could be handy for storing a pattern as an array of d-latches. 🙂
Broyojo#2667: you can input a signal to the input of the d-latch, the side peg, and only when you turn on the top peg will the data be saved
Broyojo#2667: yes the top peg is for write control
TheAffinity#3062: I am not sure if I understand what D-Latches are for, but I've been experimenting with them. My impression after playing around with them is you can set this component to a value of 'on' or 'off' for as long as the top connector has a signal sent to it, but the moment that top connector signal is turned off, whatever state ('on' or 'off') is locked regardless. https://youtu.be/Otfjo7nbL-s
TheAffinity#3062: Okay, good to know. I have 8 GB of RAM on this laptop. Just wanted to be sure 🙂
alion02#1973: technically effectively infinite, practically you'll start running into loading issues at tens of thousands
TheAffinity#3062: What's the maximum number of objects that can be placed in a single Logic World sandbox?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: ok, that makes more sence
CrispyPin#1149: 30
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Is the default simulation rate 300?
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: I already saw somewhere that the delay blocks aren't going to be changed such that a 4 tick delay block could work with 1 tick signals.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Darn, yea, I just finished a serial communication circuit and to get the reciever to work with the monostable circuit to filter the start bit from the data, I needed 4 1 tick delay blocks in series. It's just ugly.
Dragon Lord#6944: If you just hold the pin on the inverter on, the clock will stop
Dragon Lord#6944: Not as a single component unless you're modding. You can make them pretty easily though with a delayer, an inverter, and a monostable circuit (should be four components total)
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Is there going to be some sort of clock block, something that sends single tick pulses at x ticks per second, perhaps with an input to enable/disable it?
alion02#1973: that's how i've been living so far
alion02#1973: even better if you anchor your anchor onto a throwaway board so that it's already in the right orientation when you ctrl-g it with intention to paste onto the end
alion02#1973: that way you only need to ctrl-g the "anchor"
alion02#1973: instead of placing them side-by-side
alion02#1973: you can cut out the selecting of things by sticking each successive board onto another
Lisa#4756: Can I copy something and paste it an indefinite amount of times without having select the things to Ctrl + G again?
alion02#1973: i also need a logicworld.net account, which is similarly problematic
alion02#1973: (slated for december i believe)
alion02#1973: i will of course upload once it becomes possible
alion02#1973: what i'm trying to say is that i want to upload it but would prefer doing so to just the circuit board in question, which is currently impossible
alion02#1973: that i've yet to clean up
alion02#1973: and amongst those other things is a lot of trash
alion02#1973: that thing is in my world where every other thing of mine also resides
captncraig#8603: any chance you've uploaded that <@!249215681093042186> ? I feel like I have a lot to learn from your building style
FinnyBc#1852: is there a way to see how many components are in a world minus the pegs?
melonik#8905: thanks
melonik#8905: ok
melonik#8905: oh
alion02#1973: one is a normal socket, the other is a fat one
melonik#8905: <@!249215681093042186> how have you made the carry in and out sockets on the same pos on 2 thick board?
alion02#1973: actually 3 circuit boards
captncraig#8603: that makes sense now
captncraig#8603: ah. and the thing in the front right is a circuit board with posts?
alion02#1973: a logic board would be too  t h i c c
alion02#1973: actually, nevermind, sorry it's placed on a mount
alion02#1973: the xor on the left is placed on a vertical logic board
Lisa#4756: oh ok I found a way to mirror it back, it's super dodgy tho, depends on how you place it.
captncraig#8603: How do you get the xors floating above on the left side like that?
Lisa#4756: I moved it to somewhere else and for some reason it's mirrored on this surface, and not on the other. ???
alion02#1973: not at the moment
Lisa#4756: Is it possible to mirror a circuit board.
alion02#1973: i ain't abusing any bugs
alion02#1973: but the clipping is visual-only and allowed by the game
alion02#1973: nothing is clipping into anything, aside from wires slightly
alion02#1973: me? what? where?
Jimmy#8080: I would love to do this but there are a lot of complications with the idea. There are no solid plans for it at this time.
captncraig#8603: ok, you've got some tricks I must not know about. Thats some intense part clipping in there.
Jimmy#8080: later today if all goes well
alion02#1973: here it is decompressed
captncraig#8603: that is very pretty
alion02#1973: it's... a mess, but the general idea is that you want to reduce the delay with which the carry propagates in the worst case (which is 2 ticks in the naive ICA above, versus 1 tick in the compressed one i just linked)
alion02#1973: here's my 2-tick latency compressed tileable ICA https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/901278060572209212
alion02#1973: currently the bottleneck is when there is a carry to propagate through the relay
alion02#1973: there is a way to reduce the total latency to 2, however
captncraig#8603: ah yes, 1 for carry, then 2 for sums to propigate the 2 xors
alion02#1973: in the worst case
alion02#1973: this design in particular has 3 latency
alion02#1973: 3*
captncraig#8603: so still 2 ticks total
captncraig#8603: ah. ok, I see that now.
alion02#1973: and does not depend on the results of previous computations
alion02#1973: since the and gate happens simultaneously for all pairs of bits
alion02#1973: yes, but you only incur this latency once
captncraig#8603: wait, doesn't the and gate still have a 1 tick delay?
melonik#8905: ok thanks ^-^
alion02#1973: <@!756203036589686864> here's an example instant carry adder
alion02#1973: 
melonik#8905: ok
alion02#1973: sec
melonik#8905: ok i dont even want to try anymore how can i make one (my brain is melted)?
melonik#8905: ok
melonik#8905: i was trying to make the latancy of sum 0 tick too
melonik#8905: ok now i understand
melonik#8905: oh
melonik#8905: ph
alion02#1973: hint: you only need to make it so that the latency of carry-in to carry-out is 0
melonik#8905: ik
melonik#8905: ok pls some image of ICA (i dont have any ide how to even start)
alion02#1973: `a XOR 1 <=> NOT a`
alion02#1973: a 0-tick XOR gate would also be able to serve as a 0-tick NOT gate
alion02#1973: see here
melonik#8905: ok
alion02#1973: unless you wanted it to be 0-tick, but again, that's not possible
alion02#1973: there's one built-in
alion02#1973: not sure why you'd wanna recreate the XOR tho
alion02#1973: as in, you need these three types of components
alion02#1973: you need an inverter as well
melonik#8905: out of more?
alion02#1973: out of *just* those two components? no
melonik#8905: ok can i somehow make xor gate out of buffer and relay?
alion02#1973: pretty confident it's straight up impossible, too
alion02#1973: not that i'm aware of
melonik#8905: ?
melonik#8905: is it possible to make a not gate out of relay
melonik#8905: ok i will try to figure it out
alion02#1973: it's not some kind of huge leap in complexity
alion02#1973: if you know how to make a normal full adder i'd recommend you try to make an ICA on your own
alion02#1973: there are designs available in <#901195561980543007>, but they're typically compressed
alion02#1973: simplest way is with a relay and a buffer
melonik#8905: how?
melonik#8905: em pls
alion02#1973: and they're dead simple, too
alion02#1973: there are ICAs in logic world
captncraig#8603: I suppose a lookup table would be instant
captncraig#8603: the standard ripple carry design has a worst-case propigation time of 2 ticks x number of bits.
melonik#8905: you sure?
captncraig#8603: no such thing
melonik#8905: how can you make instant carry adder?
captncraig#8603: I just got sucked into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-lookahead_adder and I think my brain is gonna be busy for a while trying to catch up
melonik#8905: ^-^
alion02#1973: 👍
melonik#8905: thanks
melonik#8905: now i understand
melonik#8905: oh
alion02#1973: until you're left with just one number
alion02#1973: then you add 4 pairs of 2-bit numbers together, you're left with 4 3-bit numbers
alion02#1973: so you have 16 bits, add 8 pairs together, you're left with 8 2-bit numbers
alion02#1973: the idea is that you can add each pair of bits in parallel, halving the total number of numbers that you have, but increasing the width of each number by 1
melonik#8905: what does increasing width mean?
melonik#8905: oh
alion02#1973: .
melonik#8905: whitch one is the normal?
alion02#1973: stick with the normal way for simplicity 👍
melonik#8905: 😵‍💫
alion02#1973: so for instance <[newline]> 1) you have 9 bits <[newline]> 2) you use 3 full adders <[newline]> 3) you have 3 weight-1 bits and 3 weight-2 bits <[newline]> 4) you use 2 full adders <[newline]> 5) you have 1 weight-1 bit, 2 weight-2 bits, 1 weight-4 bit <[newline]> 6) <[newline]> `weight-8 bit = 1st weight-2 bit AND 2nd weight-2 bit AND weight-4 bit` <[newline]> `weight-4 bit = (1st weight-2 bit AND 2nd weight-2 bit) XOR weight-4 bit` <[newline]> `weight-2 bit = 1st weight-2 bit XOR 2nd weight-2 bit` <[newline]> and you're done
alion02#1973: you can use full adders on columns of bits
alion02#1973: it's marginally faster in logic world where instant carry adders are a thing
alion02#1973: there *is* a faster way but
alion02#1973: what crispy said is correct
alion02#1973: right, so that's a hamming weight
melonik#8905: yea there can be like 1+0+1+1+0+1+1+0=5
CrispyPin#1149: idk if theres a faster way
CrispyPin#1149: starting at 1 bit
CrispyPin#1149: you can have sequence of adders with increasing width
alion02#1973: otherwise i'm not sure what you want
alion02#1973: if there are also 0s
alion02#1973: that is a called a hamming weight of a binary number
melonik#8905: is it possible to build adder that will add just ones <[newline]> something like this 1+1+1+1+1 = 5? <[newline]> of course in binary so 1+1+1+1+1 = 101
Deleted User#0000: ok
Deleted User#0000: oo
parallacks#7542: If you put two touching facing each other the signal is transferred from one to the other. Its helpful when you're putting two prebuilt chips together so you do have to wire between them if the sockets line up.
Deleted User#0000: what does a socket do
Stenodyon#8192: I think my CPU was saved by the fact that I used AND gates in the beginning, instead of relays, though I have one instruction that triggered the bug 😔
JC Denton#9567: If you have 1 tick delay per component you probably can't have clock speed under 4 or 5
Ecconia#4929: Queue up in the row of people that have the CPU almost done, but are just waiting for the relays to work 😛
cheese3660#8641: Breaks program counter
cheese3660#8641: relay bug fix when
JC Denton#9567: like it isn't close to fastest already?
JC Denton#9567: into really fast?
berry#1313: yeah, you can adjust the tickrate of the game tho
JC Denton#9567: that probably means that a more complex CPU you build the slower clock you must have
berry#1313: and anyone correct me if I'm wrong lmfao
berry#1313: I believe so, the only one that doesn't is the buffer and the relay if the top peg is active <@108289447799308288>
JC Denton#9567: Does every gate introduce a 1-tick or more delay?
parallacks#7542: Yeah I'm still looking at it any compacting suggestions are very welcome
melonik#8905: ?
melonik#8905: how can i turn singleplayer world to a server
101#1688: Not the most compact, but it’ll do the job 😉
parallacks#7542: I'm going to be stacking this a lot so one wide is important
parallacks#7542: Got it one wide with the d flip flop
101#1688: Could technically work IRL, but you’d need the pulse to be long enough for the latch to work, but not longer than the time taken for signals to propagate through the combinational logic between your registers.
101#1688: If you want to really understand the difference, connect the output of the dff to the input with an inverter, then do the same with a latch. You’ll see that when you clock the latch, it will oscillate crazily rather than clocking through. Shortening the pulse to 1 tick means that there isn’t enough time for the input to change again before the clock goes low at the end of the pulse and so it is as good as edge triggered. This is why we can get away with using latches as registers in LW.
Doctor Stupid#9197: stupid messy real world. always getting in the way of our pure beautiful mathmatical abstractions 😦
101#1688: In logic world? None whatsoever. You can just use a train of 1 tick pulses as your clock and use the latch as if it were a flip flop. The dual latch thing comes from real life, where “1 tick pulses” are not a thing 😛
Ecconia#4929: To tell your router to transport incoming traffic from the internet at some port of the router, to your computer. I bet YouTube has better explanations for this topic.
parallacks#7542: Ok before I ask any other questions about the flip flop specifics. Is there any advantage to using FF over the latch? I've seen people make registers with the latches. Do they serve a different purpose? I'm supposed to go on to use the FF to make registers, and RAM modules.
101#1688: The one you’ve built there is “falling edge” triggered. The output should take the value of the input when the clock goes transitions from 1 to 0
101#1688: Exactly 🙂
Biggycheese69420#4947: yes
parallacks#7542: <@!144160633691176960>
parallacks#7542: Like this?
melonik#8905: what does it mean to port forward?
101#1688: Or you can fake it by clocking a d-latch with a 1 tick pulse 😛 you can’t do that IRL, but it works well enough in LW!
101#1688: Then connect the clock signal to one of them, and an inverted clock signal to the other
101#1688: Just chain them together output -> input
101#1688: You can make a d flip flop from two latches though
101#1688: Not quite, a d flip flop is slightly different to a d latch. A d latch is “level triggered”, whereas a d flip flop is usually edge triggered.
parallacks#7542: Hmm google seems to say they are in fact not the same. similar, but not the same
parallacks#7542: Working on project 3 of nand2tetris and its talking about a data flip flop  <[newline]> ``` whose interface consists of a single-bit data input and a single-bit data output. In addition, the DFF has a clock input that continuously changes according to the master clock’s signal. Taken together, the data and the clock inputs enable the DFF to implement the time-based behavior out(t) = in(t-1), where in and out are the gate’s input and output values and t is the current clock cycle. In other words, the DFF simply outputs the input value from the previous time unit.``` <[newline]> That's the same as a D Latch in the game right? I just don't want to go forward with it and find out I was working with the wrong mental map
Verlio_H#0201: very important question for jimmy, would the birth of the baby mentioned in the most latest video delay the release of the next sarah racer
Stenodyon#8192: what language are you translating in ?
Stenodyon#8192: haha
Lisa#4756: Oh yes sockets. I'm getting mixed up with translations lol
Stenodyon#8192: The sockets? They don't have delay :)
trucksarenoisy#4659: not that i know
Lisa#4756: Do plugs have delay
QR_Query#6979: Im trying this
trucksarenoisy#4659: a BIT? you mean my entire lifespan??
Stenodyon#8192: oof haha yeah it's a bit involved
Ecconia#4929: Hmm I am pretty sure that this use case is too unique and the implementations too complex for the base game. However if a mod does this well, if might make it into the game.
trucksarenoisy#4659: googled that and i now want to burn my eyes and sanity
Stenodyon#8192: To make binary readable you want to convert that to BCD using the double dabble algorithm
HamishWHC#1827: So say I’ve created a design for a component, and use it all over my build, I’d like to be able to change one of the copies (or a master copy) and have the rest update to match, to avoid having to manually replace all the modules individually.
Stenodyon#8192: Making the counter count down requires a decrementer, which I don't have a design handy for rn
trucksarenoisy#4659: and how do i convert binary to readable numbers
trucksarenoisy#4659: How do i make it possible to count down
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: I messed my clock thingy up and was just wondering but now its fixed!
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Yes they do...
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Do displays update at the same tickrate as other components?
Stenodyon#8192: Here it is
Stenodyon#8192: Ok there's a very simple design I can give you, hang on
trucksarenoisy#4659: because i am totally lost on it
trucksarenoisy#4659: i just wanna know how make
Stenodyon#8192: Do you want a circuit to reproduce or an explanation on how it works and how to build one ?
trucksarenoisy#4659: there is a reason why i asked
trucksarenoisy#4659: i dont have a good grasp on logic and would like to be guided
trucksarenoisy#4659: i'd rather not
Stenodyon#8192: To make a binary counter you need a register to hold the value, and an incrementer that feeds back into the register. The incrementer circuit is interesting to figure out for yourself so I encourage you to do that :)
trucksarenoisy#4659: how do i make a binary counter
trucksarenoisy#4659: i want to make a counter but i need a binary counter
trucksarenoisy#4659: how do i make a thing that can count with binary
cheese3660#8641: Or with undo bug
cheese3660#8641: 
captncraig#8603: Anyone got a good small single tick pulse generator? Or other way to make a d latch edge triggered only?
trucksarenoisy#4659: how do you start a multiplayer game
Ecconia#4929: What exactly do you mean with self updating?
HamishWHC#1827: So sub assemblies (blueprints) will exist but not self updating?
melonik#8905: thanks <[newline]>  <[newline]> i didnt known that hamachi will work too thanks
Astrayo#0405: as a C:DDA and ToME nut I will absolutely be trying that at some point
CrispyPin#1149: yes
Astrayo#0405: would it be theoretically possible to build a working roguelike?
Astrayo#0405: wait
Ecconia#4929: Servers are by default "public". <[newline]> If you are hosting it on your computer, you will have to allow others to connect to it there are a few things to do: <[newline]> - Port forward the LW port in your router to your computer. <[newline]> - Check that your Operating Systems firewall does not block that port. (Windows - idk don't use that) <[newline]> - Figure out and share/update your routers public IP. Or setup Dynamic DNS. <[newline]> -> Alternatively if its only to play with friends, there used to be a program called Hamachi back in the days, not sure what is common these days. <[newline]> If you are hosting on a dedicated server, there is not much to do, except share your IP/domain in <#901167956954861628> <[newline]>  <[newline]> Not sure if that helps you, but feel free to keep asking. I cannot help you with your router or Windows issues though.
Jimmy#8080: You will also be able to share subassemblies on the Hub (https://logicworld.net/hub)
Jimmy#8080: Definitely - saving and loading subassemblies is coming in 0.91 (arriving in December, after our vacation). You'll be able to put subassemblies on your hotbar and place them like regular components.
Astrayo#0405: I think at least a "save as blueprint" feature would be a nice vanilla addition, though with mods I'm sure somebody will probably make it themselves regardless. Other games like Factorio have it, and I'd say it serves them quite well.
Jimmy#8080: We don't have any solid plans to do this in the vanilla game. Both features are very possible with mods however.
Jimmy#8080: Once we get the official merch going there will definitely be knee-highs and thigh-highs, this is my promise to you
Control#8680: its normally used to convert binary to decimal, but the modules are bijective in the necessary range so you can easily invert them
Control#8680: :)
Theodora-chan#3711: This is what I've been looking for. I didn't even know the name lol thanks!
Control#8680: you should search up "double dabble"
Theodora-chan#3711: In the 256 example, the output is like 200(11001000)+50(110010)+6(110) = 100000000
Theodora-chan#3711: How do you guys convert a multi-digit decimal number into a binary? <[newline]> I have a shift register for each digit from 1 to 9, convert into binary, and then add each . It seems very clumsy way.
HamishWHC#1827: without features like these, I'm not going to have the patience or will to build anything particularly complex in this :/
HamishWHC#1827: hey joined to ask about this: of all the games to promise this kind of thing, this seems the best, but if im going to build the crazy stuff i want to build, then i need to be able to copy paste my circuits and not have to maintain hundreds of them simultaneously! is it/will it be possible to define a circuit as a blueprint and place them around my world - and any changes to one affect all others? if i come up with a better design for x component, and my woorld has hundreds, i really dont want to have to search for them! <[newline]> also, being able to miniaturise  my circuits into IC-like things would allow the game to optimise out the rendering of the circuit (although seeing miniature versions of the circuits operating would be pretty cool, maybe as an option, or make a recursion limit :P).
CrispyPin#1149: yes
IsCoffeeTho#0001: lets go
IsCoffeeTho#0001: thigh highs for the nerds
CrispyPin#1149: its the perfect merch for this demographic
IsCoffeeTho#0001: fr
CrispyPin#1149: logic world thigh highs when
IsCoffeeTho#0001: where to get the logic world knee highs
Dragon Lord#6944: now there's a term i haven't heard in a while...
Michael#8718: There's also the famous BitBlt ( Bit Block Transfer)
TheAffinity#3062: Well, it sounds like it goes blut when you place it. Or maybe "ehhhh!"
PseudoGoose#2841: I don't think I've ever heard anyone use the term "blut" before, I like it :D
TheAffinity#3062: Sometimes experimentation doesn't always work ;D
TheAffinity#3062: Ah, thank you. It bluts because the stud goes into the surface. It works now.
PseudoGoose#2841: The panel components go through the board, the connections are on the other side. <[newline]> If the board is flat on the ground, then those connectors will collide with the ground. The board has to be standing vertically, which you can do by pressing T while creating/moving it.
TheAffinity#3062: Hi. I've been learning through experimentation of what each of the components of Logic World does (in lieu of complete lack of knowledge about logic circuits 🙂 ) and it's time now to experiment with the various panel objects. I'm having a bit of trouble trying to figure out how to mount them onto a surface like a board. The outline is red and it bluts when I try to place it.
Jimmy#8080: Definitely. Multiplayer complicates things a lot.
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: <@!154964593397989376> I'm looking forward to seeing that technical write up. Thanks. I hope it includes the multiplayer aspect, cause that's the main part that baffles me.
oddron#8955: Agreed
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Obviously, for a real-time game application, the only gate delays needed are simple single tick ones, rather than precise number of seconds.
oddron#8955: Which means I didn't skim it well enough 😄
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Yea, but the event-driven simulation described in that pdf has models for gate delays.
oddron#8955: I don't know for sure, but try the following: Look for a file called "worldinfo.succ", and in that file change the WorldTypeID to MHG.Gridlands
oddron#8955: I think the PDF is describing the basis for an RTL (Register Transfer Logic) simulation. In an RTL simulation, we do not simulate gate ticks. Instead, we simulate clock cycles. So they don't need to worry about gate delays
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: lol, to be fair, it would probably be closer to the description of the compiled-driven simulation which is more like O(n). But what got me was having 2 state vectors for the entire logic system.
captncraig#8603: how do you change the world type of a dedicated server to grid world?
oddron#8955: And I think I already see an error in my logic
oddron#8955: At least it's not 2^n overkill
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: <@!246834752328302593> I've managed to implement a very crude logic simulation. What you're describing sounds way overkill, like n^2 algorithm kind of over kill. And strangely similar to a fluid dynamics simulation(I love fluid dynamics simulations, took me years, but I finally managed to teach myself how to make one). Here's a good link that describes the general ideas behind a logic simulation. http://www.cad.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~timcheng/NOTES/03_logic_sim_2pp.pdf
oddron#8955: I am also curious about implementing a logic simulation. I imagine a simulation could work as follows. (Please note I have never actually implemented a logic simulation) <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> Read the network of parts and connections. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Divide the connections into "nodes", where a node is a set of pins and wires that are electrically connected, without passing through any kind of component (e.g. relay or buffer). <[newline]>  <[newline]> Initialize a state vector that contains the initial state of each node (on or off). This is the "present state". <[newline]>  <[newline]> Initialize a second state vector to hold the "next state". <[newline]>  <[newline]> Repeat indefinitely: <[newline]>  <[newline]>   Set every node in the "next state" to "off". <[newline]>  <[newline]>   Initialize a "dirty" flag to True. <[newline]>   While the "dirty" flag is True: <[newline]>     Set the "dirty" flag to False. <[newline]>  <[newline]>     For each pure 1-tick gate (e.g. AND, NOT): <[newline]>       Read the input pins from the present state. <[newline]>       Calculate whether the output is on. <[newline]>       If the output is on, then: <[newline]>         Set the corresponding node to "on" in the next state. <[newline]>         Set the "dirty" flag to True <[newline]>    <[newline]>     For each gate with any potential 0-tick element (e.g. Relay, Buffer): <[newline]>       Read the input pins from the present state. <[newline]>       Calculate whether any output pins need to be turned on. <[newline]>       If an output is off and needs to turn on, then: <[newline]>         Set the corresponding node to "on" in the present state. <[newline]>         Set the "dirty" flag to True <[newline]>  <[newline]>   Copy the "next state" to the "present state". (Or just swap the two pointers) <[newline]>  <[newline]>   Output the present state. <[newline]> ```
Lisa#4756: Circuitverse can't handle feedback well at all because of that implementation.
Lisa#4756: Things like Circuitverse tho, which tries to solve everything at once, has serious issues.
Lisa#4756: Well, I'm pretty sure it depends. If you have ticks, like Logic World, and Minecraft redstone for example, it's not particularly complicated.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Well Jimmy's insane optimisations mean that it is only slightly laggy when i place on the monitor and not at all when i do things elsewhere!
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Once i add ram its gonna get insane
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Maybe my monitor wasnt a good idea... my save went from 0.8MB to 3.1MB
Michael#8718: Seems like feedback loops are the only tricky part of a digital component sim?  Or maybe I am wrong
Jimmy#8080: <@!163394911838666752> for now you can use <#901199821212352573> or <#401255675264761868> :)
Jimmy#8080: <@!377717131556552708> At some point we'll do a detailed technical writeup on the logic simulation, but that won't be for a while. Good luck with your project!
Vinyl Boot Maven of Shade#1858: Would it be okay for me to ask some questions about how to implement a logic simulation? I am a one man developer that wants to make a game with a logic simulation(though I'll prolly never be able to), but I'm not trying to steal the concept of logic world. I'd understand if it's too much to ask though. Love the game though, logic world is my new top favorite logic game.
ASRS_#1059: is there a suggestions channel or somewhere those could be submitted or do they get put here?
bejoscha#0284: Thanks.
PseudoGoose#2841: Unfortunately not yet, saving and loading boards will come in an update in the near future
CrispyPin#1149: meaning you can move the board away and replace it easily
CrispyPin#1149: it creates a connection between 2 boards without having to drag a wire between manually
captncraig#8603: whats the purpose of the socket?
bejoscha#0284: Because this informs how I will build my worlds: Is it possible (if so how) to copy individual boards from one world into the next? i.e. can one build multiple "module" worlds and later copy & paste elements of it together for some mega-build?
Pegacraffft#1193: That seemed to work, thank you soo much
Pegacraffft#1193: Okay i will.
PseudoGoose#2841: Try turning down your render distance, all the way, before you load the world. Once it's loaded you can increase it again
melonik#8905: for anyone to join
melonik#8905: how can i make a server public?
zjobke#1742: ty
katkosmos#6502: 30
zjobke#1742: does anybody know what the default simulation rate is?
katkosmos#6502: Where would I get the player ID needed for the admins list in the server config?
melonik#8905: np
zjobke#1742: ah that works, thank you
melonik#8905: server "simulation.rate <number>"
zjobke#1742: it displays: command not found
zjobke#1742: does anybody know how to change the tickspeed in singleplayer? I've tried "simulation.rate 10" in the console, with no succes
Pegacraffft#1193: I have a really weird and annoying issue, that makes continuing on my CPU nearly impossible. Every time I want to launch the world, it loads, and after it finished the game crashes after like 3 seconds. The only way to fix this, was loading a backup, I had it three times now. It really makes it nearly unusable. If someone would have time to look into that, id be so grateful, because I really don't want to start all over again
Quagino#4446: thanks 😌
Verlio_H#0201: yes
Quagino#4446: perfect, thank you. so a buffer acts like a diode, if I interpret it right?
CrispyPin#1149: now there are buffers instead
CrispyPin#1149: exclusive pegs were removed
Quagino#4446: An update video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03dJFo5qYQw) showed exclusive imputs. Is this still/already in the game and if the later is true, with which key do I switch a Peg to exclusive?
RyanT#1426: Ah
Dragon Lord#6944: Ie, 0b0001 logical and 0b0010 = true <[newline]> And 0b0001 bitwise and 0b0010 = 0b0000
Dragon Lord#6944: Pinging you too
Dragon Lord#6944: Technically they are slightly different. But wise and does an and operation on every bit in the two values individually, but a logical and only looks at a word as a whole for Boolean values ie (A==0) & (B==0)
Hugin#2596: no, it is fully stackable but it takes two ticks to turn next bit on <[newline]> it would be instant if there was no reset option <[newline]> what I need is a counter that works like (B), not (A) <[newline]> but thanks for help
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Thanks Ecconnia
Ecconia#4929: You can make a counter with a constant time, no matter how many bits. <[newline]> Search for `ICA` in <#901195561980543007>
Ecconia#4929: What do you mean? <[newline]>  <[newline]> How to setup your own server: <https://logicworld.net/view/pst-44f2a22f/server-hosting-tutorial> <[newline]> If you want a list of public servers: <#901167956954861628>
Hugin#2596: Is it possible to make this type of counter, but faster(rn it's 2 ticks per) or smaller? <[newline]> Or should I just use normal binary counter and converter?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Does anyone know where info on server hosting is?
IsCoffeeTho#0001: All good 👍
mitolegy#5916: thought it was something like that, just needed some clarification thanks
IsCoffeeTho#0001: you're a natural
mitolegy#5916: ok
IsCoffeeTho#0001: correct
mitolegy#5916: ok. logical is for if a register contains anything but zero (and thus is true) and bitwise is comparing each individual bit within two bytes
IsCoffeeTho#0001: bitwise is mostly used in operation
IsCoffeeTho#0001: logical is mostly used in programming
IsCoffeeTho#0001: logical AND is if both are anything but 0 <[newline]>  <[newline]> bitwise AND if both are 1 & 1
mitolegy#5916: enough wires already
mitolegy#5916: thank god
mitolegy#5916: ok
RyanT#1426: Afaik those are the same thing
mitolegy#5916: can someone explain to me what the difference between a bitwise AND and a logical AND is at a hardware level? and can bitwise AND be used as a logical AND? negating the need for custom hardware?
melonik#8905: thanks
RyanT#1426: U will be able to in 0.91
melonik#8905: can you somehow transport ciruit boards through worlds/servers?
CrispyPin#1149: np
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: thanks anyways
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: *yet*
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: yeah im nowhere near that
CrispyPin#1149: it starts taking forever to load at 5-10MB
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ok cool
CrispyPin#1149: yeah then you're fine
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: certainly less than a MB i think 800KB?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: maybe it didnt like my current building project
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ok thats why lol
CrispyPin#1149: multi-select and sockets are especially crashy
CrispyPin#1149: most crashes are from bugs in the building system and don't get affected by component count
CrispyPin#1149: how big is the world file?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: im at like 8.5k and the number of crashes has increased exponentially
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: at what component count does the game get unstable
sybergoosejr#8256: here is my workaround but i think this could be one block so you could do relay logic
sybergoosejr#8256: Suggestion-> rename the current relay to transceiver and add a new block that is more like a relay with a normally open and normally closed with a common.
CrispyPin#1149: https://ptb.discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901158328405729371/902187350782795786
CrispyPin#1149: yea and you can convert it easily
lucman64 🇺🇦#5391: is it possible to make a grid lands server?
Ecconia#4929: Takes two inverters.
Pegacraffft#1193: Nice. You're welcome
JamHexxit#6386: yep worked thanks
Pegacraffft#1193: If you need it from off to on remove the inverter
JamHexxit#6386: well i will test it out now
Pegacraffft#1193: You're welcome
Pegacraffft#1193: Did it work? ^^
JamHexxit#6386: thanks a lot
Pegacraffft#1193: Try this. To change the pulse length change the time of the delayer
JamHexxit#6386: ok thanks
Pegacraffft#1193: Let my try to build one
Pegacraffft#1193: it is a monostable
Pegacraffft#1193: Ahhh okay i get it
JamHexxit#6386: so when the input is ON it waits until it OFF and then it gives a short ON as output
CrispyPin#1149: it sounds like you're describing a falling edge monostable
Pegacraffft#1193: wait, what exactly should it do? Maybe im stupid, but i dont get what you need haha
cheese3660#8641: 30
melonik#8905: whats the default simulation rate?
JamHexxit#6386: so is there a circuit when a input comes in it waits until the input out  and then it gives a short signal?
Pegacraffft#1193: <:thonk:598604478413013002>
CrispyPin#1149: ~~knowing jimmy the "friday patch" might come on saturday or sunday~~
CrispyPin#1149: oof
Pegacraffft#1193: I was wondered why my CPU didnt work, and after like 30 min i saw this
Pegacraffft#1193: I hope so. This is mildly infuriating
CrispyPin#1149: <:soontm:674268728027906086>
cheese3660#8641: Should be the case
Pegacraffft#1193: Okay xD Does it get patched tomorrow?
cheese3660#8641: Wait till tomorrow
Pegacraffft#1193: How can i fix that
Pegacraffft#1193: AAAAA
cheese3660#8641: Relay bug
Pegacraffft#1193: The relay should be high not low
Pegacraffft#1193: Does someone have an idea wtf this is causing
Ecconia#4929: There is! Unless you changed it. <[newline]> But keep in mind, that you sometimes have to press `T` first, cause if the board is laying, only the normal rotation matters. <[newline]> But if the board is standing you have two axes, hence the `Shift` versions are a thing.
Ecconia#4929: This basically gets printed, whenever a player gets removed from the player list by not natural causes. <[newline]> For that you need to know, that the server has a tendency, of not forgetting a player. If you leave by unclean causes, the server still thinks you are online. Mostly happens when the joining fails. <[newline]> So any kick and rejoin afterwards will print the message. <[newline]> You can play with this by using `listplayers` to get the full list of joined players and the ones still in the joining process (and the ones that are not even connected). And then if you `tp <you> <that>` to it, you will get an error if that player is not actually online. A `kick <that>` will show the error about fucky stuff.
zjobke#1742: Exactly what I need, thanks Jimmy ❤️
Jimmy#8080: <@282189238638739456> is this what you need? ^
zjobke#1742: can I make the ticks go faster? my builds seem to be very slow once they get big
Jimmy#8080: Quite a lot, and I don't get to even half of it. I am considering hiring a dedicated community manager.
bejoscha#0284: How much of Jimmy's development time is taken up by answering Discord and other social media requests? 🤨
Jimmy#8080: AFAIK there's no settings you can change right now. Should be some smaller performance improvements in 0.90.1, with bigger improvements coming in 0.91 later this year.
gotenks917#3427: will there be performance improvements when it comes to cloning boards/ are there settings i can change now that will help with that?
Jimmy#8080: https://logicworld.net/view/pst-c032a587/logic-world-faq#how-do-i-change-the-simulation-speed
berry#1313: What command do I put in the console to change the tickrate?
Theodora-chan#3711: i got it, looking forward to the next update!
Jimmy#8080: Well, there haven't been any game updates yet, so nowhere haha. But when we publish an update (first one on Friday), the full notes will be on our blog (linked in <#443541811860996096> ) and in the in-game changelog (button in the bottom left of the main menu)
cheese3660#8641: when did <#901195561980543007> get slowmoded
Dragon Lord#6944: the private git updates. /s
Theodora-chan#3711: where can i find EXACT release notes?
Michael#8718: How did people figure out their SRAM cell circuit?  Trial and error, or is there a good web page?
Michael#8718: Been trying to create a single static RAM cell in Logic World.  But I am coming up short.  If I want a single data pin, how do I write a 0, when the dlatch is 1?
alion02#1973: well good thing this thing is tiny
alion02#1973: ok then
alion02#1973: oh that's a pretty massive bummer
Michael#8718: F flips
Michael#8718: To rotate on the other axis
Michael#8718: There should be a shift-E and shift-Q
Jimmy#8080: There's no mirroring of boards presently, unfortunately. You'll have to rebuild it mirrored. I'd like to add mirroring during EA
Guardian9978#4039: Has anyone thrown together a 6bit binary to decimal decoder? I've tried but the inverters I'm using seem to cause a flicker on the output causing my 7 segment to flicker when it changes numbers.
alion02#1973: yep it doesn't help
Michael#8718: It's a contextual menu
Michael#8718: If you don't have that menu, I think you need to hit tab to get it
Michael#8718: Alien...first use G to grab.  Then look at the menu on the left
Michael#8718: alien, yes
Michael#8718: Been trying to create a single static RAM cell in Logic World.  But I am coming up short.  If I want a single data pin, how do I write a 0, when the dlatch is 1?
alion02#1973: horizontally/vertically?
alion02#1973: is it possible to reflect a board?
TheAffinity#3062: Logic World participants here are very friendly and willing to help out. They have no issue with individuals like myself who have litle to no experience in logic circuit theory
OpaJones#1619: yah that could work. i'll give that a shot
Verlio_H#0201: 8 is trivial but 9 is a bit harder, one way would be to generate a 4 bit number and if it is greater than 9 just try again
Jimmy#8080: It's never supposed to print 😅
Jimmy#8080: That's an error with the player list, I forget exactly what haha
RyanT#1426: <@!154964593397989376>, my server is outputting "there's something fucky afoot", what does that mean
OpaJones#1619: sorry I put that wrong. I need 9 different possible outputs with a guaranteed output on only 1 of the 9 different possible outputs. I've been trying for awhile now and came up dry. I just need an idea of how to get something like this working.
Reese4221#8317: nine oracles and if you need a 100% output just use a peg
OpaJones#1619: yeah but I need 9 different outputs and a guaranteed output every time
RyanT#1426: the oracle is literally a randomizer
OpaJones#1619: anyone know of a good way to make a randomizer
melonik#8905: thank you so much(^-^)
PseudoGoose#2841: oh, here:
PseudoGoose#2841: not exactly correct but close
PseudoGoose#2841: ~~this might help https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-the-windows-regional-settings-to-modify-the-appearance-of-some-data-types-edf41006-f6e2-4360-bc1b-30e9e8a54989~~
melonik#8905: where can i change it pls?
PseudoGoose#2841: It also affects how numbers are formatted (e.g. 9,000 or 9.000) which can cause some programs to break (especially C# .NET code <:eyes_sus:796654965485469726> )
PseudoGoose#2841: "locale"  is your language/region setting.
Jimmy#8080: Thanks for the heads up, I will make sure it's fixed in 0.90.1
melonik#8905: can i ask? <[newline]> what is locale? <[newline]> how can i change it? <[newline]> and where?
anningmay#1355: It was fixed when I logged out FYI
Jimmy#8080: Thanks, I just finished <#901199821212352573> , now I'm catching up on that channel 😅
oddron#8955: I am trying to get a recording that's synchronized to the tick rate
anningmay#1355: Hey Jimmy- I posted the screenshot of the error  in the bugs area. I’ll find the link
Ecconia#4929: *still not have given up on the idea of downloading from logicworld.net, once linked the purchase account with it*
Jimmy#8080: For now I recommend OBS or your GPU's utility to record footage.
Jimmy#8080: I'm planning to add replays with video export late in EA. For the 1.0 trailer, I want the raw footage to be 8k300fps. The actual trailer will be 60fps, but with ultra high quality motion blur computed from the extra frame data. Presently though there's not a way to do this.
Jimmy#8080: We're planning to put the server software on docker which should solve this problem
Jimmy#8080: Lol. Buffers are getting smaller in 0.90.1 :)
Jimmy#8080: What errors are you getting? It is very important to us that the game works fully offline, if you require an internet connection to play that's a severe bug
Jimmy#8080: Not yet but I want to add this
Jimmy#8080: Bug, will be fixed in Friday's patch
Jimmy#8080: I'm really sorry, this is a bug, see <https://logicworld.net/tracker/91>. It will be fixed in Friday's patch. For now you can change your locale (see the link).
Jimmy#8080: You can customize the colors! Click "world options" when creating a Gridlands world :D
Jimmy#8080: Board placing is pretty awkward atm. It will be improved throughout EA.
Verlio_H#0201: rip blotter
Jimmy#8080: I agree with pretty much all of this. Well said.
Control#8680: record it?
oddron#8955: <@!154964593397989376> Would it be feasible to provide a way to take a series of screenshots, one per tick?
berry#1313: thank you!
oddron#8955: Exactly
berry#1313: kinda like this?
berry#1313: ohhhhh that makes sense
oddron#8955: Step 2: Build a binary tree of these demultiplexers
oddron#8955: ``` <[newline]> Address  Data  Output 0  Output 1 <[newline]>     0      0       0       0 <[newline]>     0      1       1       0 <[newline]>     1      0       0       0 <[newline]>     1      1       0       1 <[newline]> ```
oddron#8955: It has 2 inputs and 2 outputs
oddron#8955: Step 1: Make a 1-to-2 demultiplexer
berry#1313: but I think 256 wires for each cell is a bit much
berry#1313: which is also fine I can do that
berry#1313: crunched a couple numbers in my number cruncher and looks like I need 256 outputs lmfao
oddron#8955: Alright, do you have a table of which output you want for each address? And what about the 256 - 64 = 192 other addresses?
Dragon Lord#6944: there ya go then! just use the inverted output of a pulse extender as an input to that circuit
berry#1313: is there an easier way to do that?
berry#1313: I'm lookin for 64 outputs for 8 address bits
oddron#8955: How many possible addresses? How many outputs?
berry#1313: like a circuit that turns an address into signal to one of the outputs, I'm tryna use it to turn the address into a location of the byte of ram
oddron#8955: General question: Is it possible to start a thread as a reply to a message? Especially in <#901195561980543007>
oddron#8955: What kind of decoder?
berry#1313: is there any way to make a large decoder without manually programming each combination of inputs?
pilonpl#4015: I have a circuit that converts any signal length into 1 tick signal
PseudoGoose#2841: I say LW but I don't actually have much experience there yet 😅 . But that's what I did with redstone
PseudoGoose#2841: Usually I only build / design the circuits in LW, though I do sometimes work on formulas and high-level block diagrams on paper.
Dragon Lord#6944: Then you can use an inverter feeding into a simple inverter and relay pair to get a one to pulse out of the falling edge
Dragon Lord#6944: I have a pulse extender that can extend one pulse to 30 ticks in <#901195561980543007> if you need it (just set the delayer to 27 ticks for a falling edge detector output at 30 ticks after the original pulse.
Dragon Lord#6944: If you were to use that pulse to activate a pulse extender that lasts for 30 seconds, then capture the falling edge of that pulse extender you would be able to have a one tick signal exactly 30 ticks later
oddron#8955: Question for those of you who endeavor to build a whole CPU in LW: Do you just start building it piece by piece, or do you design it outside of LW beforehand?
pilonpl#4015: I know but that's not a very elegant solution
oddron#8955: What happens if you put your signal through a chain of 30 inverters connected in series?
pilonpl#4015: Is it possible to delay 1 tick signal by, for example, 30 ticks?
BBrown#5721: 😮 that would be fantastic
CrispyPin#1149: there really needs to be an official way to download the linux server files from a windows machine
CrispyPin#1149: i can dm you the linux server files if you want
Verlio_H#0201: non standard stuff going on to make it so fast
Verlio_H#0201: it is instant so probably part of reason
BBrown#5721: Has anyone been able to successfully download the dedicated server via steamCMD onto a linux box running Ubuntu? I am attempting to setup a dedicated server on a separate linux box. I get `Error! App '1252670' state is 0x2 after update job.`. According to a message (https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901158328405729371/901177164811083846) in <#901158328405729371> apparently it's "referencing the wrong folder right now.  you should probably run it from game files instead for now".  <[newline]>  <[newline]> **My Question:** has anyone successfully gotten the server downloaded on linux via terminal and running, if so - how? If not, I guess we wait for the steamcmd folder references to be fixed? <[newline]>  <[newline]> **Additional Context:** I am playing the game on a windows machine, but there is a separate server box maintained by a buddy of mine that I SSH into. There is no GUI, only terminal so I don't really have a way of copying the actual server files onto the linux box by DL'ing them first through the steam interface on Linux. Is there somewhere I can get the linux server files so i can ftp them over to the server box?
pilonpl#4015: Btw it would be useful to be able to stack components on top of each other
Ecconia#4929: Yes, grab the board and press delete. (G -> R)
zjobke#1742: can I remove entire boards without having to remove every individual item?
pilonpl#4015: I don't like the shape of the buffer
CrispyPin#1149: the buffer is instant
Control#8680: just like ... the buffer
cheese3660#8641: But it has a tick of delay
Broyojo#2667: or also just a single tick delayer
anningmay#1355: Interesting. I was getting an error message. Next chance I have, I’ll grab it and share it
Broyojo#2667: oh cool
Control#8680: hey look guys, a buffer
cheese3660#8641: I could make a small buffer mod rn if i were home
CrispyPin#1149: Jimmy said the buffer will become smaller in some update
pilonpl#4015: It should be smaller the the AND gate xD
pilonpl#4015: You can make it with only 2 invertes
pilonpl#4015: The buffer should actually be smaller
DanielGJ44#4557: I've never had any issues doing so myself
pilonpl#4015: XD
Control#8680: 
Control#8680: "the xor is too big" <[newline]> jimmy: "no, it's analogue is 5 inverters so of course it's big" <[newline]> chads: "the buffer is too big" <[newline]> jimmy:
zjobke#1742: yea that
zjobke#1742: I dont get why its so massive for such a simple function
Control#8680: i dont know either why it's sooo big
Control#8680: i think so
zjobke#1742: a buffer is just a 1way signal, right?
Control#8680: okay <@!246834752328302593> quick correction about two days ago, the multiplicative inverse were supposed to be calculated in  <[newline]> (Z/Z2[X])/(x^8+x^4+x^3+x^2+1)
zjobke#1742: thank you ecconia!
pilonpl#4015: Thx
anningmay#1355: My entire area just lost internet due to a FIOS outage. Is it possible to play LW without an Internet connection? (cuz I’m getting errors when I try)
Ecconia#4929: <@!435026857801416705> Btw you can use `F2` to make screenshots. And `Control+F2` will open your screenshot folder.
Ecconia#4929: You have to select two group of pegs to connect. <[newline]> The two groups have to be in one line. <[newline]> You draw a wire from the first to the last peg of the first group. It will appear red (cause blocked). <[newline]> Hold control the wire and selected pegs will become blue, release the mouse. Your first group is now defined. <[newline]> Select the second group by drawing a wire from first to last peg of that group. <[newline]> Release the mouse to let the magic happen. <[newline]> If the order is wrong, you can press 'F' to flip it. <[newline]> You can use the mousewheel to make it skip some pegs while selecting (the skipping of the first group might be broken - second works).
zjobke#1742: simply multiselecting doesnt seem to do it
zjobke#1742: how do I connect multiple connections at the same time?
Deleted User#0000: ok but when wireless components 🧐???
Pegacraffft#1193: Yea, i hope it isn't too annoying to answer beginner questions, but i already got the hang of it. ^^
TheAffinity#3062: I find experimentation with separate components helps. Coming to this discord server and asking questions (as I have done many times) works too.
TheAffinity#3062: Be well and take care of yourself.
zjobke#1742: ah thank  you
pilonpl#4015: Press E/Q while holding down the left mouse button
zjobke#1742: is there a way to adjust the default direction of the blocks? I have a part that goes in a separate direction, and its pretty annoying to rotate every single block I place
Nik#1011: the controls for board manipulation are a bit wack right now. assuming you haven't changed your default controls, you'll need to use T, q/e, and shift+q/e
Nik#1011: yup 👍 you can click them together edge-to-edge
Pegacraffft#1193: Yea, okay, i see. Like i wanted to build a modular circuit, that had to be duplicated a lot and than i wanted to combine them again
Nik#1011: but they are not the same board and can be separated afterwards
Nik#1011: very useful for building stackable circuits that utilize sockets
Nik#1011: well you can stick them together edge-to-edge
Pegacraffft#1193: :c
Biggycheese69420#4947: no
Pegacraffft#1193: Can you somehow merge curcuit boards together?
Nik#1011: ^^
Pegacraffft#1193: Okay, thanks. I got it to work with a bit of port forawarding ^^
Nik#1011: https://logicworld.net/view/pst-44f2a22f/server-hosting-tutorial
Nik#1011: someone on the forum also made a whole guide on hosting a server.. lemmi find it
Nik#1011: the server can be found inside the game files or there's also the dedicated server app you might see under "Tools" in steam
Pegacraffft#1193: Ah okay, thanks
Nik#1011: There isn't an open to LAN button, but if you launch the server before opening the game then it will be automatically opened to LAN
Stenodyon#8192: Hi! This bug has been encountered by people with Czech or Slovak system languages. If you system language isn't English, changing the language to English might fix this crash
Pegacraffft#1193: thanks. And another stupid question. How do you host a multiplayer game? I cant find a open to lan button in the pause menu
oddron#8955: Press g then r
Pegacraffft#1193: Can you somehow delete a whole curcuit board with stuff on it?
Biggycheese69420#4947: np
OpaJones#1619: ty
OpaJones#1619: aight
Biggycheese69420#4947: idk
OpaJones#1619: is that a bug or intensional
OpaJones#1619: i see that is annoying
Biggycheese69420#4947: x edit it you can only edit it when the output is disconnected
OpaJones#1619: lol wow ty didn't even realize that was a component
Biggycheese69420#4947: a delayer it can delay up to 30 ticks.
OpaJones#1619: How would I add delay in a circuit?
melonik#8905: already did
bejoscha#0284: But report in <#901158328405729371>
melonik#8905: ok
melonik#8905: multiplayer works fine but i possibly cannot play singleplayer
bejoscha#0284: 😢
melonik#8905: :(
melonik#8905: yea
bejoscha#0284: With any new world?
bejoscha#0284: Oh, no, don't have that.
melonik#8905: like it drops me out the moment i join
bejoscha#0284: No, I occasionally drop out as well. But not randomly. Its specific actions that do that. If you find one, report in the bugs-channel.
melonik#8905: am i the only one who has problems with singleplayer?
bejoscha#0284: 
bejoscha#0284: ...or work with *Gridlands*  <[newline]> I think I just didn't like the color and never tried it before..
bejoscha#0284: I guess, the important trick is to always have a board to put other boards on... (then they align) and not do it on the ground like the total newbie I am ;c)
Control#8680: You can build modules and copy paste em
bejoscha#0284: What is the principle advantage of using Sockets over Pegs that are connected? (It's a bit fiddly to move the boards so that the sockets touch exactly. At least on ground...)
bejoscha#0284: (but placing them on the ground has an arbitrary angle... )
bejoscha#0284: Na, boards go 90deg only, it seems.
Control#8680: And gates rotate by only a bit so i assumed ...
Control#8680: I meant that
bejoscha#0284: Not seeing a difference between using E or CTRL + E. Both times it rotates 90deg only, both times it only "snaps" while the cursor is overlaying. Or did  you means something else?
Control#8680: I think Ctrl + e or q should work
bejoscha#0284: Ah, I see. Overlaying aligns the principle axis.... However, if I move the cursor off, it snaps back to the axis as before, so I have to *place* it on that board, then grab it again, and move it.  <[newline]> Of course that means I first need to find a place it (most often it is red), but I kind of get it. Thanks again.
IsCoffeeTho#0001: i may have gotten the axis' wrong but close enough to hopefully help out
IsCoffeeTho#0001: when holding the board with the switch you can place it directly on the display board and rotate it with these schemes <[newline]>  <[newline]> `Z rotation` `[T]` <[newline]> `X rotation` `[Q] or [E]` <[newline]> `Y rotation` `[Shift][Q] or [Shift][E]`
bejoscha#0284: Thanks.
IsCoffeeTho#0001: when placing pegs, you can align them to 1/3 a block, meaning you can have 9 pegs in a single block of space. this is possible by holding that `MOD` button during placement
bejoscha#0284: How does one align two boards that are rotated with respect to each other?
Control#8680: Is nicer
Control#8680: xor(xor(a,b),xor(c,and(a,b,c)))
bejoscha#0284: Can you elaborate? Don't quite get what you mean
Control#8680: Lol
Gositi#4985: yeah that works
pilonpl#4015: 
Control#8680: (Sum of n/2^n from 1 to infinity)
Control#8680: So 2 ticks on average
Control#8680: Well there is half a chance to go 1 tick a quarter chance to to 2 ticks an 8th chance to go 3 ticks etc
Gositi#4985: awww
Control#8680: Shhh dont give him reasons to deny us
Gositi#4985: I think this division in definitions is one of the reasons we won't see a 3-input XOR
Control#8680: <3
Gositi#4985: yeah
Control#8680: Both are valid
Control#8680: And i dont
Gositi#4985: true but I think it should be one and only one 🙂
Control#8680: 0->0 (they map 0000... to 0)
Gositi#4985: I mean one of the very first binary logic thingys I did in my life was to design a Full adder in minecraft, utilizing a 3-input XOR using my definition. I don't remember the exact diagram for it but it was kinda cursed. Well, I didn't know binary logic then
Control#8680: Is a good argument
Control#8680: Like all 0->0 gates do
Control#8680: And the Xor(a,b,c) = xor(xor(a,b),c)
Control#8680: Exclusive could also mean that it excludes all even amount of pairings
Control#8680: Parity and only one
Control#8680: There are 2 common extensions
Gositi#4985: ?
pilonpl#4015: umm
Gositi#4985: I don't see that as valid because if all inputs are True then the output will also be True with that design. <[newline]>  <[newline]> I think that it should be one *and only* one input True.
Gositi#4985: I think it should still be one and only one. After all, XOR is short for eXclusive OR, an OR where it is **either** A *or* B *or* C.
Ecconia#4929: Prolly something between 1 and 2 ticks. Or 0 and 1?
Control#8680: Cuz it can go infinitely lol
Control#8680: If you input an oracle into itself with 1 tick delay and 1 tick generators what is the expected length of a cycle?
Pegacraffft#1193: Ah okay, i see. I haven't tried copying on a board jet. I think that should do the trick ^^
Ecconia#4929: If you copy a board, all wires connecting components on that board should not disappear. Which wires do you mean specifically?
Pegacraffft#1193: Btw, is there a way to keep the wires while copying?
Pegacraffft#1193: Ahh thank you
Ecconia#4929: - A D-Latch is a memory cell. As long as the top input is ON, the state of the side input will be stored and outputted on the other side. <[newline]> - A Relay is like an in-real-life relay. The two side connectors will be connected (with no delay), when the top input is ON. (It takes 1 tick to open/close the connection). <[newline]> - An Oracles output is truly random, you will have to pulse it a bunch of times to see an output. Well it is random after all.
Control#8680: I mean id do the same as you
Control#8680: Because they said one and only one
pilonpl#4015: probably something like this
Control#8680: just a quick question, how would you personally extend the def of XOR to three inputs?
Pegacraffft#1193: But thank you anyways :) I hope ill get used to them fast, as i have some cool ideas already haha
Pegacraffft#1193: Yea makes sense. I tried each of them. But what e. g. is the difference between a D Latch and a Relay. It seems to do the same thing. And the Oracle never outputted true for me. Im probably just to stupid to use them
Gositi#4985: Oh OK. Well, I suppose you just have to experiment around with them to learn! Also IMO that's a good way to learn, as you have the "hands on" experience plus you have to describe it in your own words
Gositi#4985: The pegs are mostly for cable management, and if at least one of the cables connected are powered all will be (although power can't go backwards through something like a logic gate)
Pegacraffft#1193: Okay so far so good. I already know these gates, but the other ones confuse me. But thank you already
Gositi#4985: Well, it is for the most part standard logic gates. But I can quickly break it down for you.  <[newline]>  <[newline]> An AND gate will give a powered output if both inputs are powered. <[newline]> An XOR gate is a little more complicated and will give a powered input if one and *only* one input is powered. <[newline]> The inverter inverts the input signal, so if you give it a powered input the output won't be powered and vice versa.
Pegacraffft#1193: I have a stupid question, im completely new to the game and i dont really know what all the logic components do. My question would be, if i can read it up somewhere, or if someone could explain it real quick for me.
Gositi#4985: I think people *will* copy real circuit diagrams into logic world, no matter what you do.
Captain Cody#1940: Buffers are your OR gate
Gositi#4985: I agree. Or gates aren't needed
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ok thanks
Ecconia#4929: *Random ramble of thoughts, which I just want to point out, not directed* <[newline]> Talking about Jimmy being scared to make the game bad. <[newline]>  <[newline]> There is the golden rule of game design: "Never take something from players, they will consider that bad. Give them something different instead." <[newline]> For example: If at this stage of the game `>2 XORs` get added, it is something that cannot be undone easily. <[newline]> In general removing any component is difficult, and most likely game-breaking. ||Regards the XOR gates, since there are different ways to implement them, they are unintuitive for players. Even more tricky.|| <[newline]> It must be hugely considered which things to add to the game in general, due to this irreversible nature. <[newline]> Adding something "on a whim" is most likely often a mistake... ||(Sorry Jimmy, I know you tend to do that 😋)|| <[newline]>  <[newline]> Thus I love the phrase "(You can) write a mod for that" which the dev's tend to say a lot of times already. <[newline]> If it is something a mod can add, a mod should add it - that way the game won't break and the advantages/downsides become visible. <[newline]> *End of ramble*
Ecconia#4929: If you do not know it, it is not obvious...
pilonpl#4015: i am just dumb
pilonpl#4015: okayyy
Ecconia#4929: Hold the MOD key (probably `Control`) to fine place/rotate components
pilonpl#4015: how can i place multiple scokets on one block?
IsCoffeeTho#0001: i think you do, except i do recommend utilising the offset pegs to align wires using `MOD` while placing your peg. the `MOD` button is usually `ctrl` btw
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: How do people make 7 segment displays without all the pegs causing chaos or do i just need millions of buffers?
IsCoffeeTho#0001: in mods its two operations for 3 in XORs
LolzDEV#3402: it's an open-source minecraft clone
Control#8680: you only need 7 inverters for a 3 input xor
Control#8680: oh btw
bejoscha#0284: Never heard of minetest so far. Just googling it...
LolzDEV#3402: I like the minetest philosophy
LolzDEV#3402: but without mods you can't do many things
LolzDEV#3402: you can play it
LolzDEV#3402: sure but if u think of minetest for example, that game is just a core
bejoscha#0284: <@154964593397989376> rest your wrist! thanks for talking
bejoscha#0284: Modding isn't everything. As a beginner I'm unlikely to *modify* a game I don't even *master* yet. I can still want *features*. And relying on some modder to do it, is only second best to relying on the developers to do it.
Jimmy#8080: I'm sorry, I really have to stop typing now for my health. We can discuss this another time. But I am very sure of the principles of LW's design; I have spent four years thinking very carefully about them and testing different levels of abstraction.
bejoscha#0284: <@154964593397989376> Aren't boards and sockets essentially this? Just that you can't *shrink* them? Maybe you *could*? Really jsut draw them at smaller scale...
LolzDEV#3402: I agree with jimmy
LolzDEV#3402: we have mod support
bejoscha#0284: This could even go so far as that the first (mandatory) tutorial *builds* the basic elements...
bejoscha#0284: This is very the *miniturization* idea comes in. Gives you best of both worlds. You *learn* how those things work - because you have to build them. Maybe in a tutorial. - but then later you can *use* them in a much simpler way.
Jimmy#8080: Yes, I am scared of making a bad game. Game design is very tricky and easy to screw up.
Control#8680: you're scared
Jimmy#8080: I don't want to include those in vanilla because I want to keep the base set of components very simple. >2-input xors are, conceptually, pretty complicated and unintuitive. They're also very interesting and fun to build yourself, and I don't want to remove that interesting&fun gameplay for very little gain.
bejoscha#0284: Your example? Other version of the game?
Control#8680: hmmm
Control#8680: why dont we have multi-peg XORs yet
Control#8680: good question
bejoscha#0284: How does one get mutli-peg XOR gates in the game???
bejoscha#0284: That fact excaped me. Still you can be close to the R key and it still removes stuff...
Jimmy#8080: XOR is, conceptually and computationally, much more complicated than AND. (Try making an AND gate out of just inverters; now try making an XOR gate out of just inverters. The former takes a minimum of 3, the latter takes a minimum of 5.) The extra size is an expression of that extra complexity.
Control#8680: closest to the player that is
Control#8680: you always only power the closest key
pilonpl#4015: why is the xor gate 2 blocks wide? the AND gate is only one block wide
bejoscha#0284: Make a world with a "R" assigned key. Move around pressing "R"... have fun killing your world.
bejoscha#0284: ...but then you should not be allowed to have mutliple key-elements with the same key assigned, right?
Jimmy#8080: I'm not sure what you mean by this, could you elaborate?
Jimmy#8080: Keys are intended to transport your real-world inputs directly into the game. In that sense, you press one key in real life, so one key goes down in the game.
Control#8680: i'd rather have 3 input xors, since those would be actually useful
Control#8680: well
Control#8680: without vs with OR gates (3 input ANDs were used for OR gate analogues)
bejoscha#0284: Also: is there a kind of "safe-play" mode where editing is restricted, but assigning "R" to a key is possible?
bejoscha#0284: Question (possibly bug?): I can have multiple "key" inputs with the same key in a world... Shouldn't *all* of them trigger simultenously on that keystroke?
Jimmy#8080: There's a balance to strike to be sure
bejoscha#0284: Hmm... Maybe. But then it is probably a bit *too* close to reality?
bejoscha#0284: Sure. But exaclty for that (and the general learning process) I think the game should be able to reproduce some canon-examples without some extra steps needed.
Jimmy#8080: That said, Logic World is not intended to be a companion to real-world logic courses. I want it to be its own thing. I don't want players copying circuit diagrams from the real world into LW, I want them thinking about LW within the context and rules of *that* universe.
Control#8680: or gates give a clearer structure on how a circuit works
Jimmy#8080: This game is definitely rough on beginners at the moment, and I want to improve that. There will be a guided campaign/tutorial that takes players through various logic concepts.
Jimmy#8080: Haha fair
bejoscha#0284: I definitely *can't*. Total beginner, as mentioned.
bejoscha#0284: Fair, and shows how super-creative one can get. I just think that total *beginners* (like me) would like to see the *basic elements* from each and every coursebook replicated as element in the game to start with.
Jimmy#8080: Can you show me an example of where an OR gate would be useful? I think it's usually much cleaner to just feed multiple outputs into the same peg, and use that as an OR
Control#8680: concept art
Jimmy#8080: <@!492362038681796619> developed a brilliant >2 input, 1-tick XOR gate, check this rad shit out
bejoscha#0284: Give me some proper OR gate and I save a lot of clumsy-space :c)
Control#8680: (just like the amount of inputs in the xor)
Jimmy#8080: If things are clumsy and hard to see, then I consider that an issue with that particular design. Try laying out your circuits more clearly and cleanly :)
Jimmy#8080: I agree. This area of the game could definitely use work.
geezmolycos#2652: It's sometimes difficult to deal with the dependency of those boards
bejoscha#0284: <@154964593397989376> I see your point. But it is sometimes counteracted by the fact that some things are clumsy and hard to see. It should be possible to "enter" (and watch, not edit) those compounds, though. <[newline]> I had something in mind like the above mock-up.
Jimmy#8080: Not presently but I'd like to add this!
geezmolycos#2652: <@!154964593397989376> Can I group a bunch of boards without placing them on another board?
Jimmy#8080: I'm sure there'll be a mod for it eventually, but I think it would compromise the experience I'm trying to create, so I want to keep it out of the base game.
Jimmy#8080: This could be done, but I don't want to do it in vanilla. It clashes with my vision for the game - where every single little part of the circuit is fully simulated and fully visible. In a massively complex CPU, you can walk up to every single little part and watch it function as the CPU executes instructions.
bejoscha#0284: This would be *sooo* powerful and make requests of some components (like OR gates) redundant.
bejoscha#0284: General question on feasiblity before I submit a feature request: Is there a possibility to implement "shrinked" components? I was thinking along the lines of: A board with un-connected board-pegs. Select it and have a "compile" option. Creates a solid 3D box  which can be coloured and has a label. It also has the same amount of Pegs showing out on front/back as the board, arranged in the same way (but compact). This element *can't* be edited anymore and acts like the whole board, but it is a lot smaller...
bejoscha#0284: Moving is a lot simpler than resizing, though. I could live with just that for a start...
Jimmy#8080: I agree, I want to add this for all kinds of resizing. Like if you have stuff placed on the side of a board, the parent board should be able to be resized in that direction, moving its children with it.
Dragon Lord#6944: Lol XD
bejoscha#0284: *Boards* are really nice. It would be very nice, if the could shift (like when grabbed) while mounted on a *mount* when the *mount* is resized.
Jimmy#8080: omg I forgot about that
Dragon Lord#6944: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901195561980543007/901674209216987237
Jimmy#8080: As for writing on flags, yes, this will come later in early access along with tons of other cool flag customization features :D
bejoscha#0284: It would be solved quickly, if the regular labels could be rotated vertically. They could act like a *board* elements with "T" changing their flatness.
Jimmy#8080: I decided to revert that. I wrote about it on the devlog; https://logicworld.net/view/pst-7cc8d90d/logic-world-wednesdays-season-finale#the-big-flag-rework-jimmy
Jimmy#8080: As for vertical sign-boards, you're the first person I've seen build those but I love the style! Yeah, that's the best way I can think of to do them.
Jimmy#8080: My wrists are healing, thank you for the concern though 😄
bejoscha#0284: <@154964593397989376>: I hope you use "speach to text"! Otherwise: Save your wrist.
Jimmy#8080: I worry that this would get visually confusing
bejoscha#0284: <@154964593397989376> Flags are awesome, but didn't you have many more in your YouTube videos than just single colour? I would like to write text on them!
bejoscha#0284: I think I might add a feature request for a simple "sign" element...
bejoscha#0284: Also: With all the love of customization Jimmy shows - why can't I change the backgorund color of the label, just the text?
bejoscha#0284: 
bejoscha#0284: Is there a *good* way of creating vertical sign-boards?  <[newline]> What I did was create a Mount with a vertical board and then a label on that board. A bit clumsy (in particular when one later wants to change the height of the mount.) Anything better?
bejoscha#0284: I see, what you mean.
Dragon Lord#6944: at least two inputs* <[newline]> a true or gate can only be constructed using two buffers at the moment
bejoscha#0284: Is an OR gate not striclty defined as having TWO inputs ?
Dragon Lord#6944: an or gate has at least 2 inputs
Dragon Lord#6944: it is not an or gate
bejoscha#0284: But despite its name, it *is* and OR gate, isn't it? More so than the pegs.
Jimmy#8080: Although keep in mind you cannot rotate an object if the rotation would place it inside another object
Jimmy#8080: sounds like a bug
bejoscha#0284: Related question (or bug?) Why can't the buffers be rotated on a board using Q and E unless "grabbed" ?
Dragon Lord#6944: but, yeah, i kinda want or gates too lol
Dragon Lord#6944: buffers are more multi-purpose and faster
bejoscha#0284: Sure, but isn't that true for an OR gate as well? And given that we don't have an OR gate as element, people get very confused.
Dragon Lord#6944: also, reported a (somewhat) related bug <[newline]> see bug tracker issue #154
Dragon Lord#6944: gocha
Jimmy#8080: Buffers do not allow signals to travel back through them - they are a 'buffer' between one part of the circuit and another.
Jimmy#8080: Yes. I would like to change this. I'm thinking of removing the `Mod` trigger entirely, it's more trouble than it's worth.
bejoscha#0284: Why is the buffer called buffer? Isn't it a simple OR ?  <[newline]> (Pegs are also OR, but do not have a dedicated output)
Dragon Lord#6944: I can't seem to find the control for multi wire placement in settings, is it locked as mod+place wire?
Jimmy#8080: <@!435026857801416705> For now you have to place each component one at a time. In 0.91 you'll be able to quickly click-and-drag to make a row.
pilonpl#4015: how can i build rows o the same element?
TheAffinity#3062: Maybe I should take a closer look at more of these videos. Faster than experimenting 🙂
TheAffinity#3062: Thank you! <[newline]>  <[newline]> Ooooh, flashies! 😄
PseudoGoose#2841: Here's the original video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXyCWFR0gv4 <@!327621821421715456>
PseudoGoose#2841: Yep, an Oracle is basically RNG. Whenever the input goes high, it outputs a random 0 or 1.
TheAffinity#3062: More questions, so sorry. Oracles are fascinating components. They only allow flow on a random moment (as if they are saying, "when I feel like it").  Considering the definition of an oracle is a priestess who gives often mysterious predictions, this seems to fit. You don't know if the oracle will pass a signal or not. <[newline]>  <[newline]> At least, this is the impression I got based on the results from the following test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplocQBcaxM
Dragon Lord#6944: i wish that that kind of or gate were good practice in real world circuits, but the power loss from floating values and pull up/pull down resistors sucks 😔
TheAffinity#3062: Thank you for your help 🙂
Dragon Lord#6944: a relay is instant also (as long as it's already switched on-it takes one tick of delay to switch it on/off)
Verlio_H#0201: also a buffer is instantaneous, unlike the other gates which take 1 tick
oddron#8955: Excellent
TheAffinity#3062: As you said, it goes in only one direction through the buffer.
TheAffinity#3062: 
TheAffinity#3062: Okay, I looked up what a diode is and then performed the following experiment, as that's how I learn in lieu of knowledge 😛
TheAffinity#3062: Thanks for the reply. I'll need to look up what a diode is. I have zero experience in logic circuits (I have tons of experience as a software programmer though) so I'm new to these concepts.
oddron#8955: This means a buffer will allow an "on" signal to pass in one direction and block it in the other direction.
oddron#8955: The game uses a wired-OR system. That means if two or more outputs are connected to a network of wires, and one of them is on, then the whole network turns on. The buffer acts like a diode.
TheAffinity#3062: Hi. <[newline]>  <[newline]> I've found out from experimentation what most of the components do, but buffer is a puzzler. I assumed it was some sort of capacitor that stores an on (red wire) state but it's not behaving as I expected. I know it's not a delay because there's a component by that name already.
oddron#8955: I'm writing a program that can read a world file. Is there any documentation for the custom data attached to each component?
circuitgamer77#0377: I wonder if it works in the future if I change the default hotbar...
Nik#1011: D:
Nik#1011: ah ye that's on the server in the world data
circuitgamer77#0377: My hotbar info.  For my singleplayer worlds I've been copying my hotbar data between saves to avoid setting it up again.
Nik#1011: huh what were you trying to edit specifically?
circuitgamer77#0377: With a singleplayer world it's in players/circuitgamer77.succ
circuitgamer77#0377: I mean I joined a server, and want to edit my circuitgamer77.succ file, which I was assuming would be on my computer rather than the server.
Nik#1011: I don't think there is one for the whole server but there is inside the world
Nik#1011: player config file?
circuitgamer77#0377: Anyone know where the player config file for servers is stored?
OpaJones#1619: not sure what that means never worked this kinda stuff before. but its very interesting to use 😄
Dragon Lord#6944: (although I've also used them to make a 2 component pulse extender)
Dragon Lord#6944: yep! their whole purpose is to store a single bit
OpaJones#1619: are d latches also the best way to store data to compare it later?
OpaJones#1619: awesome ty! very helpfull 😄
Dragon Lord#6944: the signal shouldn't flow back to the data when you power the top pin
OpaJones#1619: ahhhh
Dragon Lord#6944: then reset by powering the top pin
OpaJones#1619: but how to reset?
Dragon Lord#6944: exactly
OpaJones#1619: like this?
Dragon Lord#6944: wire the button directly into the data and latch, or use a diode if you need to extend the wire (just don't let signals travel from the latch to the data) then you can connect the latch through diodes to a centralized 'reset' button
Dragon Lord#6944: d latches can do that :)
OpaJones#1619: so i made a tic tac toe but instead of using switches i wanna use buttons to make it reset by it self but i'm kinda stuck on how to keep the input stored untill reset
Nik#1011: ok or <@!731601007523397643>
DustyAngel47#7299: Dont forget 'Ruthenic'
DustyAngel47#7299: :)
Nik#1011: ikr just ask <@!714583473804935238> or <@!721657788060663848>  or <@!881734757749256212> or <@!784639607543037963>
PseudoGoose#2841: only two names? rookie numbers
Nik#1011: just those two. I changed my username everywhere to vykori about 6 months ago
Deleted User#0000: how many names have you got <@119734190571913216>  😦
Nik#1011: it might already be in the game idk, did you test
Nik#1011: well I'm 90% sure the succ library supports this so theoretically it's easy to add..?
Limón#7879: 😭 😭 😳 🍋
CrispyPin#1149: specifically the display configs
CrispyPin#1149: can you edit succ files live?
Vynix#3003: I use Unity btw
Vynix#3003: Ugh...Unity
PseudoGoose#2841: Linux based OSes generally do use less storage than Windows. But maybe the Unity libraries on Linux are larger than on Windows
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Does anyknow know of a command to view my current tick rate?
Vynix#3003: Okay. I use ARCH btw.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Maybe its an mistake? I dont know, i dont use linux
Vynix#3003: I am looking through the Steam requirements, and it says that <[newline]>  <[newline]> Windows: 1GB of Storage <[newline]> Linux: 2GB of Storage <[newline]>  <[newline]> Doesn't Linux consume less storage, when compared to Windows.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: not the prettiest but who cares
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: 
oddron#8955: You're welcome!
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: <@!246834752328302593> Just wanted to say thanks for helping me with the division yesterday. I FINALLY managed to build an 8bit binary divider thanks to your explanation and multiple tries!
Rack Smix#3697: does anyone know how i could make a component that changes color depending on the input pegs ? Couldn't find anything in the API documentation
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: It's what took me from enjoying mathematics to also enjoying literature
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Very good book
oddron#8955: Also, I never heard of that Paul Lockhart book
oddron#8955: The school has to maintain a minimum pass rate while maintaining appearances, so they teach a system of procedures. Students that do pursue higher mathematics end up getting screwed when they get to calculus class because those procedural systems fail for doing limits and integrals
oddron#8955: *Precisely*
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: And that is a fundamental flaw
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: The us school system doesn't teach mathematics it teaches a system of doing mathematics
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: A mathematicians lament
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Book by Paul Lockhart
oddron#8955: I heard somewhere that supposedly only 7% of students develop an intuitive understanding of algebra. The other 93% suffer through it. The quantity and complexity of the work are designed to build a solid foundation for higher mathematics. I think the biggest problem with algebra class in the US is the failure to recognize that algebra and higher mathematics, in their present form, are a literal waste of time for who don't intend to pursue a math-dependent career. They would be better off focusing on applied mathematics. I completed 4 levels of calculus classes by the time I graduated high school, but they never bothered to mention the very practical skill of money management.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Check the faqs on the news tab but it’s something like server “simulation.rate 1000”
Control#8680: lmao
musashi#0210: mb
musashi#0210: must have been my data
Control#8680: we get it
Control#8680: ok kid
Control#8680: or Modules?
Control#8680: ever heard of Fields?
Control#8680: there is a difference between algebra in school and algebra in Uni
musashi#0210: i hate algebra
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: It's so much that it's really easy to make a simple error
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Algebra makes itself a hard class solely by the complexity of the work given by the teachers
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: It's easy to do, but just so much to do
musashi#0210: i hate algebra
Control#8680: 1
Control#8680: so
Control#8680: we only need that inverse
Control#8680: and since the factor of x^10 is just 1
Control#8680: this one
Control#8680: g=x^10+216x^9+194x^8+159x^7+111x^6+199x^5+94x^4+95x^3+113x^2+157x+193
Control#8680: by a constant polynomial
Control#8680: im doing polynomial division
Control#8680: lol
Control#8680: i didnt
Control#8680: but then
Control#8680: i thought i needed it
Control#8680: <@!246834752328302593> btw everything we did yesterday...
Broyojo#2667: oh no sussy
LolzDEV#3402: why the world isn't being loaded on another thread? this way the os is trying to kill the game since the main process is blocked
Control#8680: ye
Control#8680: oh
CrispyPin#1149: the and gate is up to no good
CrispyPin#1149: a broken one at that
Control#8680: this is... a half adder
Krzeseło#2988: how this work's?
Krzeseło#2988: 
Krzeseło#2988: 
Dragon Lord#6944: also, what's the command to edit tickspeed? that would also answer my question lol
Dragon Lord#6944: do d latches only have switching delay, or is it input->output delay with an instant latch pin?
Riku#9814: Yeah I'm really enjoying this game. I'm slowly trying to find new and improved styles haha. In the thread I made here it showcases a brand new version of the calculator I made. Even though it's bigger, it's a night and day difference compared to my first couple versions. I think I'm gonna share the world now.
Riku#9814: Style Update
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Nothing wrong with working in 2d, better even, the good thing about logic world is that you can have whatever restraints you want(~~within the restraints of the game~~)
Jimmy#8080: Work however you like working! The great thing about LW is that you can build in so many different styles :D
Riku#9814: I just see these massive structures you guys make, and it makes this seem unsustainable. I feel like I sort of utilize double-sided boards pretty well but I still feel like I'm working in 2d and not 3d.. 🤔
Riku#9814: 
Riku#9814: Does anyone have any design tips? For example, I made a half adder/full adder circuit and now I need to connect some kind of controller interface to it. (8 switches) In the past, I'd make a janky circuit board with the display and inputs on it and then clumsily wire everything together, but I bet there's a way better way to do it. I'll provide some example images in a second. <[newline]>  <[newline]> This first image is the adder circuit and I'll remove the debug displays soon. The second image is an example of the janky way I'd stitch everything together before.
DanielGJ44#4557: You can adjust it to something more easily divisible though if that's easier
iHateClothes#9824: alright thanks, I thought I was going insane,. That's the result I got too but I want to make sure
PseudoGoose#2841: yes by default it is 30 Ticks Per Second, so about 33.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 ms per tick
iHateClothes#9824: so we should just see how many times 30 fits into 1000(ms)?
iHateClothes#9824: 30 ticks is 1 second, right?
iHateClothes#9824: how many ms is a tick? I'm very confused atm
Jimmy#8080: yeet
Verlio_H#0201: although to be fair he says he plans to add a lot of stuff post 1.0
Verlio_H#0201: jimmy said that he plans to add move stuff post 1.0
musashi#0210: id ask jimmy when he's on (he might be invisible rn)
Vincent#1295: thanks 🙂
musashi#0210: no idea for all of those
Vincent#1295: is that against the principle of the game ? is it planed ? would mods be able to support this? in any case, very cool
musashi#0210: there's nothing that moves atm
Vincent#1295: Great game. I have candid question as I know nothing about this kind of games. One question : are there moving parts ? For example if I want to build an elevator, will I have to rely on visual something  using the displays, or is there a engine element and the ability to actually move some elements
Shamus03#0617: massive long rainbow flag when
Control#8680: but once their activate they count as part of the network and are "instant"
Control#8680: exactly
oddron#8955: 
oddron#8955: They also need a tick to go the other way, from not letting things through to doing that
Control#8680: relays need a tick to change from letting things through to not doing that
oddron#8955: Feature request: Can we have to ability to record a short video from within the game? (The game already has the ability to take a screenshot)
oddron#8955: Anyway, I used `server "simulation.rate 1"` in the console, and I can clearly see that my relay test circuit (above) needs 1 tick per relay to propagate the signal after I toggle the switch. My understanding is this is the expected behavior for the relay.
oddron#8955: I remember trying to use OBS a long time ago, and I remember not being able to get it to work
Control#8680: also screen render is not the same as the game calculations
Control#8680: not that it's actually instant
Control#8680: 0-tick just means its calculated within one tick
Jimmy#8080: https://obsproject.com/
oddron#8955: I wish there was an easy way to record my screen
Control#8680: but the same tick
Control#8680: 0-tick, but not the same time
PseudoGoose#2841: yes please, LW can totally fit on a CD <:bobby:628326527817220106>
ieee 802.11ac#6337: lw physical release when
ieee 802.11ac#6337: 👀
Jimmy#8080: It's my dream game too 😄
berry#1313: this is like literally my dream game I would make if I knew a ton about game dev
oddron#8955: And I now saw this message, after posing
Jimmy#8080: "it scratches my brain i love it" I'm putting that quote on the box art
oddron#8955: I was able to grab a screenshot just after toggling the switch, before the relays were finished updating. I don't know how to capture a video. I am trying to demonstrate that relays are *not* 0-tick devices
Jimmy#8080: Thanks so much ❤️
berry#1313: cool game btw it scratches my brain i love it
berry#1313: huhh true, I watched the video you made about them and thought that
Jimmy#8080: Also, Relays are only 0-tick for signals going through them. They still take one tick to toggle between open and closed when the control peg changes state.
Jimmy#8080: AND gates have two input pegs and an output peg. Relays have three input pegs. This is important; they behave quite differently, if you play around a little bit you'll see.
berry#1313: If relays can be used to make 0 tick 'and' gates, why not just make 'and' gates 0 ticks with the same logic?
Control#8680: okay imma start watching it
oddron#8955: Yes
Control#8680: also since that's your pfp, is hunter x hunter good?
Control#8680: the game calculates the relay and peg connections as a single wire network, that can either be on or off depending on what is fed into it, so it can't create a circuit like that i think
oddron#8955: I think that's right. Suppose I have a finite network of relays and I intend to simulate the network until its state stops changing. I'll select a relay and evaluate it. If the relay's input is off, nothing changes. If the relay's input is on, and at least one side is on, then due to wired-AND, both sides of the relay will become "on". It is not possible for anything to turn off. After a finite sequence of evaluations, either all relays will be on (and the state stops changing) or a fixed-point will be reached (and the state stops changing).
Jimmy#8080: great explanation
Control#8680: yeah then you are right
PseudoGoose#2841: Exactly
Control#8680: 3 pegs in a loop can still turn off, right?
PseudoGoose#2841: relays don't do that, they just pass signals through
Control#8680: didnt think of that huh
PseudoGoose#2841: they are capable of directly driving the state of a wire to "on"
PseudoGoose#2841: outputs are the wide pegs like the output of the inverter
Control#8680: idk actually
Control#8680: it should be
PseudoGoose#2841: I used that phrasing intentionally
Control#8680: and have an SR latch
Control#8680: you could then reset it with the top peg
PseudoGoose#2841: relays don't have "outputs"
Control#8680: yup
PseudoGoose#2841: like two relays connected together to make a loop?
Control#8680: but they were talking about it being in circle
Control#8680: oh well true
PseudoGoose#2841: I'm not an expert on the simulation logic, but as I understand it (and as I would implement it myself): <[newline]> The two sides of a relay don't "depend" on the state of each other directly, they instead look at the state of the output pegs that are connected to it (including through the relay, via the linker layer)
Control#8680: really? <[newline]> even if its in a circle?
PseudoGoose#2841: No, there has to be an output peg driving it for it to stay on/true
Control#8680: and then get stuck
Control#8680: it would calculate all true in the same tick
Jimmy#8080: It is *supposed* to be impossible 😅
Jimmy#8080: Well, unless I fucked up lol
Jimmy#8080: Nope
oddron#8955: Since relays don't have a tick delay, is it possible to create a network of relays that would produce an instantaneous infinite loop and time-lock the simulation?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: must be a separate check as otherwise it doesnt work...
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: (128-1*128=0) or do i need a separate check for that?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: coz 128/1 = 128
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ok so with this, if A-B128 = 0 then surely it should be 1 aswell right?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: A/B: <[newline]> if A - B128 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - B64 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - B32 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - B16 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - B8 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - B4 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - B2 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - B1 > 0, then 1 if not, 0;
circuitgamer77#0377: I've never really used C#, so I'm learning though these files :)
cheese3660#8641: Should check out <#901659878869844048> then, weve been having fun
circuitgamer77#0377: I have a utility to decompile DLLs, this will be fun :)
kiveon#0480: yeah you can see from previous messages that my backups were useless as well... but eh 🤷‍♂️  at least I know now what is too large
Jimmy#8080: All components in the vanilla game currently use c# for logic, so it's hidden away in .dlls
Jimmy#8080: see <https://logicworld.net/tracker/111> for discussion
Jimmy#8080: I am having SUCH A GOOD DAY!!!!!
Jimmy#8080: Sorry for the bugs!!
Jimmy#8080: The game automatically creates backups in case of exactly this. On the main menu, hit "open game files" (bottom left), and check the `backups` folder there
circuitgamer77#0377: Is it possible to view the implementation of a component's logic?  I'm exploring the game files and can't find a readable version of that.
circuitgamer77#0377: Where the relay doesn't allow the signal through some of the time despite having both inputs on.
cheese3660#8641: Relay bug?
circuitgamer77#0377: Anyone have a possible temporary solution for the relay bug?  It's causing my divider coprocessor to give incorrect results...
Stenodyon#8192: I had a very good day and I'm looking forward to the next :)
DanielGJ44#4557: Mod is having a busy, but overall positive, day. How are you doing today?
IsCoffeeTho#0001: are the mods and/or devs having a good day?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: oh
cheese3660#8641: But takes 1 tick to open/close
cheese3660#8641: And has no signal propagation delay between one side to the other
cheese3660#8641: A relay is also 2 way
fletcher#7412: I was just about to ask about exclusive pegs to make one way gates xD searching it I saw they were removed
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: and a relay is literally an and gate with a slightly different pin layout
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: buffer is like a one way thing
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: lol
pepperell#2291: Well now I need to make a random music generator. thanks.
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: a singer makes nice sounds and a drum makes banging sounds/percussion
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: input an on signal and randomly get either on / off
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: random generator
pepperell#2291: Yeah what is oracle
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ohh ok, no problem
fletcher#7412: Thank you
fletcher#7412: As for the gates themselves I know how (most) work. It's more about controls and some other LW specifics
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: and for any logical things you can just look up the names, for instance a d-latch can store 1 bit and and an AND gate requires both a+b to be on for the output on (a and b being the inputs)
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: just look up them up on yt and watch the logic world wednesdays video
kiveon#0480: lost all my progress 😂  that was my only world...
fletcher#7412: Hey, is there any place I can check documentation on the game? Trying to figure out how all the components work
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: hopefully you didnt lose too much progress
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: no problem
kiveon#0480: thank you anyway 🙏
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: im afraid i dont know if that doesnt seem to fix it
kiveon#0480: umm yeah... I don't remember tho if I exited and loaded the world at any point when my quite massive build was there
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: yeah
kiveon#0480: like did loading the world work before?
C4io#2688: You don't jump de subtraction
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: as in the save/load system
kiveon#0480: worked
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: And have you ever had any mods (not even sure if any are out yet)
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: did the game work before?
kiveon#0480: ctrl+v
kiveon#0480: ctrl+c
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: if B*n is less than 8bits what happens
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: what do you mean?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: show me how you pasted them
kiveon#0480: I'm trying earlier backups too but not working
C4io#2688: You also need to see if B\*n is lester than 8bits
kiveon#0480: I think I'm doing it right but my world may just be beyond repair :(
PseudoGoose#2841: oh sorry, I meant <@!725522870175793164>
PseudoGoose#2841: `A - B*128 > 0`
PseudoGoose#2841: you can escape them by putting a backslash before: `\*`. Or what I usually do is put formulas in code blocks with \`\`
C4io#2688: I didn't know about that
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: did that work?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: i was wondering why some were in italics and some werent
oddron#8955: And c4io didn't fix it
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ohh thats why
oddron#8955: Yes. Discord interpreted the asterisk as italics formatting
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: B128 means bx128 right? not the 128 bit
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: so go all the way back into the main files where you clicked backups and instead go into saves and from there into your world and replace all the files
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: and then copy the files into the actual save]
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: yeah
kiveon#0480: aaah the most recent I see
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: so you would go into 2021-10-24@02-18-34
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: wait a sec
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: no
kiveon#0480: just paste the files in like this?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: I was super happy when i found that out lol
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: you just need to go into your local files >backups>saves>whateveryourworldiscalled and then just copy everything in the most recent backup, go to local files>saves>whateveryourworldiscalled and paste
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: yes
kiveon#0480: soo... any way to fix a broken world?
oddron#8955: Excellent
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: yeah i see that coz its just shifted
oddron#8955: You are doing division by repeated subtraction. If you want to divide a/b (both positive), then you could repeatedly subtract b until the result is less than b. The quotient is the number of times you subtracted b. For efficiency, you can subtract multiples of b, starting with large multiples. In binary, useful multiples are 2b, 4b, 8b, 16b, etc
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ok awesome
oddron#8955: Yes
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: The value of A in the -B64 would be the A-B128 if the value had been bigger than 0 right?
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: i get it now, i was just not thinking it through properly, Thanks!!
oddron#8955: Sometimes the best way to learn is really to "just do it"
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: ohh
Nik#1011: lol
Nik#1011: ok before you expanded and started explaining, at first I was like "Ah yes the classic 'just do it' tutorial"
C4io#2688: A/B: <[newline]> if A - Bx128 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - Bx64 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - Bx32 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - Bx16 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - Bx8 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - Bx4 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - Bx2 > 0, then 1 if not, 0; <[newline]> if A - Bx1 > 0, then 1 if not, 0;
oddron#8955: 118/17 <[newline]> Successive doubling of 17: 17, 34, 68, 136, ... <[newline]> 136 is too large, so use 68 <[newline]> 118 >= 68? Yes, so the quotient gets a 1 bit and the remainder is 50 <[newline]> 50 >= 34? Yes, so the quotient gets a 1 bit and the remainder is 16 <[newline]> 16 >= 17? No, so the next bit is 0 and remainder is still 16 <[newline]> Quotient  = 110(binary) = 6, remainder = 16
oddron#8955: Just do long division in binary. Each step requires a binary decision that will produce one bit of the quotient
DeadlyRAPTR#1916: Does anyone have anything on binary division?? Ive been looking around and cant find anything or if i can i cant understand it. Ive already got a multiplier etc but cant figure out how to divide at all
Limón#7879: What update will modding be fully supported
PseudoGoose#2841: and side note: very large boards (I've been making ones that are a few thousand tiles long) are kind of glitchy, at least visually. I think I've seen that problem before, where texture coordinates don't have enough precision
PseudoGoose#2841: Yes I could. But <[newline]> a) I don't want to have to resort to running an external program every time I want to make a large board, and <[newline]> b) yes, that program does have the potential to break the game (I have done it a couple times)
oddron#8955: Or does that break the game?
oddron#8955: Weren't you working on a program that can generate boards? Can you generate a board larger than 80x80?
PseudoGoose#2841: Would like to be able to use a circuit board as a "baseboard" for a bunch of child boards - e.g. a modular adder design. So I can parent them all to one board instead of to each other, which will make it a little easier to grab and move around. <[newline]> But my adder module is 4 tiles wide, and for 32 bits that's 128 tiles :(
PseudoGoose#2841: Currently there seems to be a limit on board size, up to 80x80, will that be increased in the future?
Control#8680: like reed solomon or BHC
Control#8680: this is btw needed for error correction coding
Control#8680: i've made it in scrap mechanic for now since that was just faster and im more used to it
oddron#8955: Excellent
Control#8680: alright my division seems to be working
Nik#1011: I think this is the closest we got to an announcement on board saving/loading
CrispyPin#1149: <:soontm:674268728027906086>
oddron#8955: Have there been any announcements regarding when board loading/saving will become available?
oddron#8955: Two times the number of bits in the input? https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/24076/number-of-iterations-of-the-euclidean-algorithm
Control#8680: do you know what the worst case of this is? in terms of iterations?
Control#8680: im thinking a hardware implementation shouldnt be that hard tbh
Control#8680: 
oddron#8955: Excellent
Control#8680: hell yeah it worked for a different example i just tried
oddron#8955: Excellent
Control#8680: its pretty straight forward even with polynomials ig
oddron#8955: Division and inverses require the extended Euclidean algorithm,
oddron#8955: In F_101, addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed with ordinary integer arithmetic, and the results are reduced modulo 101
oddron#8955: That's explained in the Wikipedia article. I would suggest trying to find inverses in the finite field F_101 (that decimal 101) to learn the algorithm, before trying to do it GF(256)
Control#8680: :3
Garfued#7855: I see I see. Awesome, I know have power. Thank you
Control#8680: you can also edit the delay block lol
Control#8680: it inverts every tick if you input it into itself
Garfued#7855: Does the inverter have a bit of delay on it?
Control#8680: inverter
Garfued#7855: Is there a good way to build a clock without using the delay block? So that you can get faster than 1 second of delay.
Control#8680: how do i get the inverse from the quotients?
Control#8680: well kinda
oddron#8955: Excellent
Control#8680: okay so i think i now have relearned the algorithm
0nxe#7222: WHY IS LOGIC WORLD SO.. educational
Laefye#2763: Someone can tell how `save` works (documentation about the file format)
oddron#8955: Skip ahead to p/a
oddron#8955: The first 2 table rows are trivial
Control#8680: step one: since a is smaller than p, we subtract it with according shift...
Control#8680: so basically
oddron#8955: Bear in mind, they are using 283 instead of 285
oddron#8955: Look at the table in the worked example under "Simple algebraic field extensions"
Control#8680: confused
Control#8680: wat
Control#8680: the 285 polynomial
Control#8680: well
Control#8680: so step 1 is a/285 in my case, right?
Control#8680: gcd
Control#8680: oh right
oddron#8955: This: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm#Simple_algebraic_field_extensions
Control#8680: but then what?
oddron#8955: Exactly
Control#8680: basically a/b i can easily find quotient and remainder
Control#8680: polynomial division isnt a problem at all
Control#8680: so
oddron#8955: And once you have the ability to do polynomial division, you can implement Euclid's algorithm
oddron#8955: https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82265686.pdf
oddron#8955: Or you could use a linear feedback shift register
Control#8680: but i reallly really dont want to :P
Control#8680: technically i *could* hardcode this
Control#8680: i mean
oddron#8955: I don't need the results at all. I'm trying to help you find the results you asked for 🙂
Control#8680: or do you want it in base 10?
Control#8680: here are the first 16
Control#8680: the table seems very random to me at least
oddron#8955: Excel doesn't "excel" at iterative algorithms. The highly efficient Extended Euclidean algorithm is iterative
Control#8680: for each row
Control#8680: grey = 79 math operations
oddron#8955: 🤣
Control#8680: (my "script" is in excel)
Control#8680: i can make a table of inverses
oddron#8955: Is your computer fast enough to brute-force the non-trivial multiplication table for GF(256), which has 254^2 entries, and then scan through these entries to create a table of inverses?
oddron#8955: Good
Control#8680: is the inverse
Control#8680: 10001110
Control#8680: found it
oddron#8955: The article doesn't cover how to divide polynomials. Do you know how to divide polynomials?
oddron#8955: The Wikipedia article has a worked example in GF(256), but using 283 as the irreducible polynomial https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm#Simple_algebraic_field_extensions
Control#8680: (setting up a script rn)
Control#8680: i can try
oddron#8955: Can you find the inverse of 00000010 ?
Control#8680: Since 1*1 = 1
Control#8680: Thats 00000001
oddron#8955: Can you find the inverse of 00000001, perhaps by brute force?
Control#8680: We can assume that its 8 bits because otherwise we could just take it modulo 11d
Control#8680: There should exist a polynomial so that their product modulo 285 = 11d (as a polynomial) is 1
Control#8680: Is for every 8 bit polynomial
Control#8680: So basically what i wanna find
Control#8680: Lol my bad
oddron#8955: Also, thank you for clarifying that 285 represents the polynomial you use to define multiplication. Now it makes sense why it's 9 bits
oddron#8955: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2347206/how-to-compute-the-inverse-of-a-polynomial-under-gf28
Control#8680: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/864199589824299070/902125090748125194/unknown.png
Control#8680: Thats GF(2^8)
oddron#8955: May I suggest the following: *Prove* that 285 is a primitive root by creating a table of discreet logarithms. And then use that table to directly calculate any inverse.
Control#8680: As i said addition is just xor
Control#8680: So 100000001-100011101 = 000011100
Control#8680: So you can subtract/add 100011101 since thats the same thing in GF(2^8)
oddron#8955: With 9 bits, right?
Control#8680: 257 = 100000001 right?
oddron#8955: So If I somehow land at 257, which can't fit into 8 bits, then I'm stuck at 257?
Control#8680: But modulo according to Galois Field (2^8)
PseudoGoose#2841: I'd Imagine you do the operations with 9 bits, and then take the results modulo 256 (drop the top bit to get 8  bits)
Control#8680: You do modulo 285
Control#8680: And if you go above 8
oddron#8955: Isn't that GF(8) ?
Control#8680: Its an 8 bit number
Control#8680: 2^8 elements
oddron#8955: GF(256) with 2^256 elements?
Control#8680: Thing is
Control#8680: Or Z2[X] if you will
Control#8680: In GF(256)
oddron#8955: Also, I'm confused by your question because 285 > 255 and needs at least 9 bits
oddron#8955: In general, you can find multiplicative inverses using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm
Control#8680: ||so for example `11*11` in GF 2 = `10*11+1*11= 110+11 = 101`||
Control#8680: ||GF(256) just means we are working with 8 bit inputs and addition (by extension all other operations that use it, except multiplying by 2) is just a bitwise XOR||
Control#8680: Yes, 285 is a primitive root
Control#8680: Anyone know how to find the multiplicative inverse of a number in GF(256) modulo 285?

Stenodyon#8192: Factorio uses base64 to allow transferring blueprints to and from the clipboard, I think that could be a cool feature to have
Jimmy#8080: We're using a custom binary format for them. Text string export/import is a possibility in the future.
Krzeseło#2988: you would  like to send it*
Krzeseło#2988: ye, if would you send it 😄
Control#8680: I have some math papers if you wanna learn?
Krzeseło#2988: there's a way how to learn  to do something except just playing game?  xd (such as video's on yt)
Control#8680: For example factorio manages to convert blueprints into Ascii Strings which you can then just place, any teasers on how you'll do it?
GuessWho#7332: Can't wait!
Jimmy#8080: The ability to save and load subassemblies (what you described as "blueprints") is coming in update 0.91, targeted for this December
Jimmy#8080: So instead we'll be using the Logic World Creation Hub: https://logicworld.net/hub
Jimmy#8080: Don't want to use steam workshop for two reasons: <[newline]> 1. Players who get the game outside of Steam would be left out, and we want to include them. (Somebody tipped $20 today when they bought LW on itch.io ❤️ ) <[newline]> 2. The steam workshop sucks lol, we can do way better
GuessWho#7332: <@!154964593397989376> Are you thinking about implementing steam workshop for blueprints (user made machines that could be transferable between worlds)?
Laefye#2763: Who knows how saves works in Logic World (Format documentation)?
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Didn't see you replied lol

Akshay#2319: <@!530612216567824384>
FinnyBc#1852: how can i delete an entire board and everything on it
pipe01#7194: If you still need help you can try launching the server with the `--plain-text` option
sos carbonarre#3314: you can convert any base to any other base if you know the multiplication table of the destination base which you can just hardcode
circuitgamer77#0377: A division module in hardware is helpful anyway :)
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm currently trying repeated division, which I think will have a similar operation time, but for me it's a bit easier to conceptualize for now.
Ecconia#4929: MSB - Most significant bit / highest value bit <[newline]> BCD - Binary coded decimal / a decimal digit 0-9 represented using a binary 4 bit number
Ecconia#4929: You can easily apply the double dabble algorithm. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Init: You have a temporary **DECIMAL** value. <[newline]> Loop: Multiply temp value by 2 and add the MSB of the binary input on top. (The msb gets removed from the binary input, so next loop you take the next highest bit of it) <[newline]> Termination: When no more bits are left. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Decimal multiplication by 2 can easily be done digit by digit when using BCD. Addition +1 is trivial, cause *2 always causes even numbers. <[newline]>  <[newline]> As final step convert the BCD digits to 7Seg done.
circuitgamer77#0377: The normal algorithm is repeated division by 10 and looking at the remainders, but division is hard in hardware.
gotenks917#3427: i dont have any experience with bcd sorry
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm trying to solve the problem, but if someone else had made one I could build off of that,
gotenks917#3427: ah
circuitgamer77#0377: Not quite.  I need to take in a binary number and output a binary coded decimal number, preferably modular per decimal digit.
gotenks917#3427: like a multiplexer?
circuitgamer77#0377: Anyone have a design for a binary to decimal converter?
Akshay#2319: thank you
Jimmy#8080: There are a few on the hub: https://logicworld.net/hub
Ecconia#4929: Which input format/type? <[newline]> (decimal/BCD/binary/unary)
Akshay#2319: Nope I left the thing for now, I wanted to make an seven segment display. If you have an seven segment display can you please share the working behind it? It would be helpful
Ecconia#4929: Did you find a solution by now? <[newline]>  <[newline]> It's not exactly the buffer you need. But any form of diode, to prevent the signal from flowing back, just like in real life. <[newline]>  <[newline]> LogicWorld has two type of diodes, the obvious one is the buffer, it comes with the advantage of being instant (and the downside of being imo way too huge for neat circuits and that the flow direction is not intuitive). <[newline]> The other diode is any output pin on almost every component. These outputs act like diodes, so instead of a buffer you can use 1-tick delayers, but these all cost you 1 tick, which is in your usecase totally fine.
katkosmos#6502: why is 160 the max fov <:blaze:716897128621932574>
Nik#1011: np!
Akshay#2319: Ok thanks, my bad
Nik#1011: <@!298146102274949121>
Nik#1011: naw you can just grab the whole circuit board first, then delete it
Akshay#2319: How do i delete a circuit board lol? Do i have to delete all components?
Saltypretzel#0321: Yeah if you just put them strung together lol
iHateClothes#9824: 30 = 1 second and you can stack them in series
Akshay#2319: thank you
Jimmy#8080: such as a counter circuit
Jimmy#8080: It's to encourage you to find more interesting solutions if you need longer delay :)
Jimmy#8080: That's correct <@!298146102274949121>
Akshay#2319: Im playing on singleplayer and is 30 on delay the maximum?
jamac#7749: <:bobby_joy:692808284331049040>

Jimmy#8080: `config.succ` <@!440328294429360148>
jamac#7749: also, is there a server config file? I got it running, but I want to change the port (if thats even possible)
jamac#7749: ^ this would be super nice too
PseudoGoose#2841: Would you consider providing public download links for the dedicated server binaries? That is what e.g. Minecraft does (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server)
jamac#7749: hell yeah, docker is epic
Jimmy#8080: I'd like to get the LWDS on docker so this whole process isn't so annoying
Jimmy#8080: Install steam on a linux machine I guess haha. As <@!487413285403099136> said, steamcmd might work. Either way the server is DRM-free just like the client so once you have the files you can just copy them anywhere
NijiIro#7339: never mind
NijiIro#7339: I wonder if its in there
NijiIro#7339: oh look a tutorial
NijiIro#7339: how do you specify a port instead of it just getting a random one when you load a world
ieee 802.11ac#6337: steamcmd on your server maybe? i don't know
jamac#7749: is there a way I can download the Linux version of the server? I am on windows so steam installs the windows version but I want to run it on my linux server
Jimmy#8080: Thank <@!499587666497634314> for writing it :D
jamac#7749: thanks
jamac#7749: ohhh, that is perfect

ieee 802.11ac#6337: side note: if you installed the `Logic World Dedicated Server` on steam, you need to move everything BUT the `GameData` folder into a separate folder on the same level as `GameData`
jamac#7749: thank you!
jamac#7749: amazing
ieee 802.11ac#6337: yes
jamac#7749: do you know if I can run the server on linux?
jamac#7749: cool
ieee 802.11ac#6337: if you already own the game you can find the server executable by looking in <root game folder>/Server/
ieee 802.11ac#6337: the server comes included with the game, as far as i know you need to own the game to host a server
jamac#7749: My friend just showed me the game and I wanna try running a server. does the server come included with the game? do i have to buy on steam/itch for it?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: the relay works like <[newline]> is the top input on? yes? ok connect both side ends <[newline]> the buffer is just a diode
Akshay#2319: Buffers dont allow backwards transmission of a signal on the same wire and relays are basically two way and gates but with 0 ticks as far as i know
gotenks917#3427: what does the buffer and relay do?
iHateClothes#9824: Ok
Jimmy#8080: yeah
iHateClothes#9824: in series?
Jimmy#8080: Try using multiple delayers per singer for the long notes
iHateClothes#9824: since if i make a delay too long then the song just stalls
iHateClothes#9824: I guess I'm needing the repeater style operation to make long lines of music blocks
Nik#1011: lmao
Nik#1011: I was going to use this as an argument to jimmy to change delayers
iHateClothes#9824: haha
Nik#1011: didn't know if 2 different people asked the same question
Nik#1011: oh ok 😅
iHateClothes#9824: yeah
Nik#1011: did you make this forum post? https://logicworld.net/view/pst-e619c502/delayer-input-pulse-too-short
Darth feir#7467: ty
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hit x while your cursor is over an and gate
Nik#1011: if you right click it you can edit the AND gate component
Darth feir#7467: ive been seeing 3 and 4 pin and gates how get?
iHateClothes#9824: ok
Nik#1011: 30 ticks per second
iHateClothes#9824: hmm so how can I accomplish this then? Lots of music notes with an adjustable delay between each? Playing one after the other? I've experimented with clocks and such but haven't done anything useful. Also, how long is an in game tick by default?
iHateClothes#9824: thank you
Nik#1011: here's my post I referenced: https://logicworld.net/view/pst-000f003f/logic-world-delays
iHateClothes#9824: A lot of this is far beyond me
iHateClothes#9824: 
iHateClothes#9824: and it's not quite working for my application
iHateClothes#9824: I am trying to use them like the redstone repeater
iHateClothes#9824: hmmm
Nik#1011: fun fact: if you clock the input of a delayer, it will maintain whatever state it is in, which makes it behave like a latch of sorts. I made a D-latch circuit based around a delayer latch for fun lol
Nik#1011: (which I appreciate)
Nik#1011: and jimmy considered the options heavily
Nik#1011: I wrote an enormous forum post about different ways delayers could be implemented
iHateClothes#9824: the delayer only works if the input pulse is fairly long and even more so if the delay is set longer
Nik#1011: yes
iHateClothes#9824: hey is the delayer supposed to not work if the input pulse is short?
Jimmy#8080: Will leave my computer soon
Jimmy#8080: I need to stop
Jimmy#8080: Can't help myself haha I'm just so excited about everything 😊
Nik#1011: then why are you replying to me D:
Jimmy#8080: Well, except for 0. heal my poor abused hands
Jimmy#8080: This is pretty much exactly it lol
oddron#8955: Because we haven't figured out how to get an AI to convert a poorly specified list of requirements into a full, working computer program 😄
Nik#1011: why does development have to take time 😭
Nik#1011: I assume the dev's priority list is roughly: <[newline]> 1. fix game crashes and ridiculous bugs <[newline]> 2. add/finish extremely needed features like board saving and loading <[newline]> 3. come back to improving the game like they were before release
musashi#0210: please its so weird
Jimmy#8080: Board rotation is sucky and unintuitive atm, improvements coming at some point (no ETA yet)
Jimmy#8080: "board rotation up" and "board rotation down" only apply when the board is standing, they don't do anything when the board is flat
Jimmy#8080: Coming in 0.91
Jimmy#8080: As you figured out, you can copy the file manually. You can also open up `settings_master.succ` and change the secret setting `MHG.DefaultHotbar`. Native support to save/load hotbars, and various other hotbar improvements, are coming in 0.91 or 0.92
circuitgamer77#0377: Changing that fixed it, which is a bit weird considering that I never touched that key...
circuitgamer77#0377: Rotate clockwise was confilcting with reset offset, but I was only using rotate counterclockwise...
circuitgamer77#0377: There are no conflicting keybinds either, as far as I can tell.
PseudoGoose#2841: Hm :/
circuitgamer77#0377: but those don't work...
circuitgamer77#0377: "board rotation up" and "board rotation down" are shift-, and shift-.
PseudoGoose#2841: That might be it?
PseudoGoose#2841: I'm in the middle of a super long loading screen unfortunately so I can't look up the default modifier for it
circuitgamer77#0377: I haven't changed the mod key (still ctrl)
circuitgamer77#0377: Rotate is . and , for me
circuitgamer77#0377: The game looks like it says shift-rotate (I changed the rotate keybind) for me, but it does the same thing as just rotate...
PseudoGoose#2841: I think T will do what you want. And then alt+Q and alt+E (or maybe another modifier) will rotate which edge is connected
circuitgamer77#0377: Anyone know how to change the edge that a board wants to place on while moving it?  My 16 segment display only wants to be sideways at the moment...
hackenstab#7456: need a buffer to buffer your buffer
Biggycheese69420#4947: no
GooseFairy#6680: is this a bug?
hackenstab#7456: I see that three inverters is a common choice for a clock signal, is there a reason you'd do this over say an XOR feeding back in itself, which seems a lot faster, or am I missing something?
circuitgamer77#0377: Yay :)
circuitgamer77#0377: Copying the hotbar section of the user file works!
wideirp#8346: Thanks!
ieee 802.11ac#6337: not currently
wideirp#8346: Is there a way to place multiple items in a row? I've tried ctrl but that just seems to allow in block placement for smaller components.
circuitgamer77#0377: Wait - I think I can copy the user file!
Biggycheese69420#4947: no
circuitgamer77#0377: Is there a way to transfer your hotbar from one save to another?
AKShredder8#2904: cheers
ThrilledTear#8448: cheers
ThrilledTear#8448: got it
ThrilledTear#8448: ohhh
AKShredder8#2904: including the server part with the quotes
ThrilledTear#8448: is that not what i did
AKShredder8#2904: you have to do literally: server "simulation.rate NUMBER"
ThrilledTear#8448: have i spelt it incorrectly or something
ThrilledTear#8448: 
ThrilledTear#8448: ok sorry to bother again
AKShredder8#2904: 🙂
circuitgamer77#0377: You beat me to it :)
ThrilledTear#8448: < 3
ThrilledTear#8448: tysm youre the coolest
AKShredder8#2904: server "simulation.rate 100" but replace the 100 with the ticks per second
ThrilledTear#8448: Hi! by any chance does anbody know the tickrate command to change the tickrate of the game
ieee 802.11ac#6337: also applies to pegs, circuit board, probably some other stuff
Saltypretzel#0321: ooh okay thanks
ieee 802.11ac#6337: for fine place
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hold ctrl
Saltypretzel#0321: but idk how
Saltypretzel#0321: because like i remember seeing you can place multiple small sockets together or something
Saltypretzel#0321: what difference between small socket and chubby socket
LolzDEV#3402: also the community here seems to be very nice so i'm sure that if u need help someone will help u
LolzDEV#3402: he explains everything from scratch
Dazegambler#9584: i basically have zero to no experience with computer logic but i'll take a look on that  thanks
LolzDEV#3402: I can confirm that helped a lot
LolzDEV#3402: actually I used this to build the first version of my cpu in the game
ieee 802.11ac#6337: this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU
Dazegambler#9584: what do you guys recommend reading/watching so the things i'm seeing in <#901195561980543007>  start making sense lol
cheese3660#8641: True
PseudoGoose#2841: At the low low level of digital logic, XOR is generally harder to implement than AND
cheese3660#8641: Why is the XOR gate 2 wide and the and gate 1 wide
asquared31415#0311: it's 4 full adders and 2 half adders
asquared31415#0311: oh wait
asquared31415#0311: it adds sets of 3 and 2
asquared31415#0311: yeah this makes a tree
asquared31415#0311: I think it works in 4-6 ticks, not sure exactly
PseudoGoose#2841: right
PseudoGoose#2841: instead of a long chain
asquared31415#0311: but it's 5 adders and a half adder
PseudoGoose#2841: oh, but with full adders you can make a tree of them
asquared31415#0311: it's a little compressed
PseudoGoose#2841: or just incrementers (if you can control whether to add 0 or 1), which are slightly simpler/faster than full adders
asquared31415#0311: if this world ever loads I would show you
asquared31415#0311: <@!316553438186045441> you can do it with a handful of adders, that's what I did
PseudoGoose#2841: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network
PseudoGoose#2841: one idea is to use a "sorting network", to pack all of the 1-bits into the LSB. Then it's much easier to decode (just unary)
cheese3660#8641: C sharp I presume
Aaron Speedy#8362: What language is this game written in?
CrispyPin#1149: actually i dont even need many since im just adding 8 bit
CrispyPin#1149: i guess i'll just chain adders
CrispyPin#1149: oh ok
CrispyPin#1149: thats basically what i'm doing but i want to do it in parallel instead
Red_3D#3062: ig have two counters. one is used to enable each input once and the other counts how many of those are on?
CrispyPin#1149: i meant in logic
CrispyPin#1149: what
Red_3D#3062: with `popcnt`
CrispyPin#1149: how does one count bits efficiently
Stenodyon#8192: either with a delayer set to one tick, an AND gate with both inputs wired together, or a buffer (which is instant)
tatertacoma#1234: How do you make the equivilent to bottlers in logic world? (without using like a d-latch thats alyaws enabled)
Red_3D#3062: because its windows
Miska#7569: why does my windows warn about every nerd game file thing i download
Mollex#9983: when increasing the tick rate can you also increase the max delay of the delayer?
Miska#7569: or is it the pitung thing
Miska#7569: so i downloadd it and its in (%APPDATA%\LocalLow\Mouse Hat Games\The Ultimate Nerd Game\) now what
ieee 802.11ac#6337: if you want something even harder check pins in <#588822987331993602>
ieee 802.11ac#6337: simplicity
Miska#7569: but idk whats the idea of not having other gates
Miska#7569: ok i can build the rest
Miska#7569: i spent 10 euros
Stefan#5422: or wait for mods
Stefan#5422: >:)
Miska#7569: oh no
Akshay#2319: Not possible without buffer eh?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: NOT gate is the inverter
Stefan#5422: you can build the rest
Miska#7569: hi im new, but where are the rest of the gates theres only xor and and
Stefan#5422: buffer
Agent Blue#6258: Awesome, Thanks for the update! I did put a ticket in on the issues page too.. #126. Keep up the great work. This is freaking awesome to play with!
Akshay#2319: I need to use pegs
ieee 802.11ac#6337: just connect the first and second lights directly to the switch???
Akshay#2319: how do I prevent this(the first switch only needs to turn on first and second bulb but it goes via second switch's peg to the third bulb as well) from happening without a buffer? Like I have way more switches with way more combinations than this
Mollex#9983: if it doesnt work u need to open the port 43531 from the router
Mollex#9983: look ur ip and connect to urip:43531
Mollex#9983: go on whats my ip website
Mollex#9983: run it
Mollex#9983: you just need to download steam logic world deidcated server
Xatar Remmo#0484: do you know someone
ieee 802.11ac#6337: ask someone that runs a server
ieee 802.11ac#6337: i'm a mod dev not a network engineer
Xatar Remmo#0484: <@!487413285403099136>  can you help me ?
Xatar Remmo#0484: bruh wtf is this
Xatar Remmo#0484: but how can i do a online server
ieee 802.11ac#6337: sir that's a local ip
Xatar Remmo#0484: can some one pls try joining this server ip: 192.168.2.100:43531
Mollex#9983: u can create a subtraction circuit  easily from that and u need the carry in
Mollex#9983: keep the first carry in
musashi#0210: so how are numbers actually added, or rather how are they represented
musashi#0210: im just gonna keep the carry in
musashi#0210: a
pepperell#8025: NICE
musashi#0210: deleted first carry in lmao
musashi#0210: <:bobby_thinking:692790276938399835>
Xatar Remmo#0484: yo how do i play online whit a friend ?
pepperell#8025: <@!478769019873132548> Here's how I chained mine. Same as yours but with posts for the i/o. Good work
Xatar Remmo#0484: Hi how can i make a online server to play white my friends ?
musashi#0210: ok so the structure is there and it seems to be functional (doesn't explode when i turn it on), but i have no idea how to use it
pepperell#8025: Good day to learn logic design
musashi#0210: im really glad you say that, because i literally have no idea what im doing
CrispyPin#1149: you can also easily edit the world config file to set it to gridlands, but make a backup
pepperell#8025: Looks like the one I made!I suggest putting the carry Input on the other side so you can easily chain them
musashi#0210: did i make a full adder? lol
DanielGJ44#4557: LOL sorry but hopefully that helps
pepperell#8025: You mean I have to start over?? 😉 Thank you!
DanielGJ44#4557: There's a "gridlands" option in the right-hand menu when creating a new sandbox in single player, <@901845920608567296> :)
pepperell#8025: Seems like there is a max size a board can be, but I see screenshots where they are massive. How do I create bigger boards? Or remove the grassy field and just have the entire surface be a grid?
Mollex#9983: for the series id think
Mollex#9983: multi comp placing is removed but it will be  back in 0.91 i think
Kahyxen#0001: Hey is there any way to connect multiple pegs together in series? Like make the bottom look like the one above? <[newline]>  <[newline]> Also is there a way to multiplace components without having to constantly click to place 1 down?
Red_3D#3062: yep, using character rom is a nice solution
Munashe#3730: For my seven segment display, I used inverters and pegs to manually setup the decoding(? encoding?) to determine which character to show based on a four bit bus(?)
Red_3D#3062: sure
Munashe#3730: Could you just use a bunch of inverters as ROM?
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Nice
Radiant#3222: appearently
Radiant#3222: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/401255675264761868/900504692625403955
Radiant#3222: not so noic
Macrohard Onfire#0662: ROM isn't really something you can do here if you don't even want switches. You have to send signal from somewhere
Radiant#3222: also nice kazuma pfp
Radiant#3222: for the CU you dont really need reprogrammable
Radiant#3222: like reprogrammable by the user
Radiant#3222: but thats like soft-rom
Radiant#3222: o ty
Macrohard Onfire#0662: A bunch of switches and and gates in front of them, 2nd input for and gates turns on for a specific address? I don't know how you want it specifically but that's how I'd make it
Radiant#3222: like how should i build it?
Radiant#3222: Ideas for ROM?
GuessWho#7332: Thanks!
The Pringle Box#1813: okay
asquared31415#0311: and then it's `server "simulation.rate value"` IIRC
asquared31415#0311: press \` to open it
asquared31415#0311: yes, it's a console command
The Pringle Box#1813: can i change to tickspeed in a single player world?
Ecconia#4929: Depends on which pulse output length you want your clock to be. <[newline]> If you just need a signal of any length, you can use an inverter and a delayer in combination. You will get an equally long off and on signal. The delayer defines the length (consider the extra tick of the inverter too). <[newline]> You can also attach a Monostable at the output (pulse cutter, detects rising edges and outputs defined pulses then). <[newline]> To turn that clock off, just power the inverter with a switch. <[newline]> (So it's just like in MC :P)
GuessWho#7332: do i just use delayers and try to time it  like minecraft or is there a normal way
GuessWho#7332: can anyone tell me how to make a clock
Akshay#2319: ok it answers my question Ig but im still not able to solve the problem
circuitgamer77#0377: I think what you want is a buffer.
Akshay#2319: Like im trying to make 2 but it activates the 1's thing as well
Akshay#2319: How do I not let a signal go back a wire? Like only one way transmission?(im not that good at these things but im interested 😅 )
GuessWho#7332: but yeah no problem with wires
GuessWho#7332: thanks
GuessWho#7332: omg this is so cool
GuessWho#7332: 
GuessWho#7332: just made it normally
GuessWho#7332: they weren't interfering i guess
The Pringle Box#1813: you can glitch it tho
The Pringle Box#1813: yeah, that's a thing in this game
GuessWho#7332: thank you
GuessWho#7332: goddamn
GuessWho#7332: I want to make flip-flop (SR) but wires are interfering
The Pringle Box#1813: e, q
GuessWho#7332: how do I rotate
GuessWho#7332: just bought it
GuessWho#7332: yo
oxi#0420: oh ok thanks
sos carbonarre#3314: Aka 2 boards then copy the 4 etx
sos carbonarre#3314: Put it on board and copy them exponentially
oxi#0420: like this
oxi#0420: How would i quickly connect a grid of pegs to another grid of pegs
prankblack#5490: It works!
ieee 802.11ac#6337: basically diodes
prankblack#5490: I was wondering, what are buffer component for?
prankblack#5490: I'm reading wikipedia wrong lol
prankblack#5490: thanks for the help
prankblack#5490: oh ok thanks so just some pegs receiving the inputs and the result of the other one
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm pretty sure you want those to be ors, not ands?
prankblack#5490: Am I a dumb fuck, it's just always on 😄
Jimmy#8080: great attitude
musashi#0210: so it stays
musashi#0210: but its cool
musashi#0210: im not really sure what i did
musashi#0210: light on the left is flashing
circuitgamer77#0377: clk is clock, which determines when data gets read into the latch.
Starficz#7554: so you could use that
Starficz#7554: you are also given a dlatch
Starficz#7554: it doesn really mean anything until later
Starficz#7554: clk is just on
musashi#0210: what does CLK mean here, and how would i recreate this ingame?
Starficz#7554: because this game has wired or's, i think the most "optimal" in terms of tick delay is to use nots+buffers+ pegs as ors
Jimmy#8080: You can make a NAND by combining AND with an inverter
Jimmy#8080: No, because <[newline]> 1. You shouldn't be left out from sharing creations if you bought the game somewhere other than Steam <[newline]> 2. Steam workshop sucks, we can do a lot better
prankblack#5490: Hey I'm a very very very noob with electronic, I'm trying to do a flip flop but can't find how in game with no nand gate. Am I missing something?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Integrate to steam workshop?
Jimmy#8080: and a few other tihngs eventually ;)
Jimmy#8080: The Hub will also be for mods
ardhati#9461: i seeee
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: ^
ardhati#9461: or a file replace type way of mods
Jimmy#8080: https://logicworld.net/hub
ardhati#9461: is it going to have a workshop system?
Jimmy#8080: but yes. https://docs.logicworld.net/
Jimmy#8080: unifinished, has a lot of problems, will change a lot before we officially release modding support
C4io#2688: There's a documentation of how to create mods?
Jimmy#8080: ^^
Agent Blue#6258: says the parameter is invalid. i dont see a read me or any documentation so i dont know any parameters.
Agent Blue#6258: https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/901199821212352573/901651414026162248
Whisper#7076: What's the error
Whisper#7076: ew, okay I have no idea then
Agent Blue#6258: no, win 10
Whisper#7076: Are you on Linooox?
RyanT#1426: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
RyanT#1426: wtf, it's there now, but it wasn't when I was setting up my server
Agent Blue#6258: my dedicated server wont run. just throws an error.
RyanT#1426: it's not there
Whisper#7076: It's in tools
Starficz#7554: will there be nesting in this game? ie: a separate world with some input/output pins that corrate to a smaller part in the main world
RyanT#1426: also, I still don't have the LW dedicated server
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hit f3
Whisper#7076: F3 or something
C4io#2688: How can I see the fps?
Jimmy#8080: whatever your PC can handle
Jimmy#8080: We'll fix this soon. In the meantime, <@!499587666497634314> is working on a guide to setting up a server, including a workaround for this issue.
RyanT#1426: just like in x and z
RyanT#1426: 15 km
oddron#8955: How high can we build?
RyanT#1426: yes
oddron#8955: (i.e. 50,000 tiles in each direction?)
oddron#8955: So the world is 100,000 tiles by 100,000 tiles?
RyanT#1426: 0.3 metres
ieee 802.11ac#6337: iirc ~0.3m
oddron#8955: How big is each tile?
RyanT#1426: <@!154964593397989376>, I know this will be hard, but at one point can you make a visual editor for modded components? it would make making modded components A LOT easier
ieee 802.11ac#6337: 15km in all directions
oddron#8955: How large is the world? And how high can be build vertically?
C4io#2688: What is the tick speed limit?
Agent Blue#6258: Im having issues setting up a dedicated server. I bought the game through steam, when i launch the Logic World Dedicated Server, a console window appears with an error message and closes. Any ones else get this?
musashi#0210: i feel dumb for not seeing this immediately
Starficz#7554: so wired ors, got it
Mollex#9983: pegs + buffer to prevent feedback its the or
musashi#0210: called pegs
Starficz#7554: this game also has wired or's right?
blood#2178: I am seriously struggling getting a working 8bit to 3xBCD. Already have my 7segs with BCD to 7seg converter. Has anyone successfully done this yet?
musashi#0210: i was looking through main and found this, and im too lazy to make it any smaller
Mollex#9983: yea i re built it now and its like yours
Jimmy#8080: <@!709540741315297391>
musashi#0210: *to the tune of day n night* now look at this
musashi#0210: also just bought the game, im really happy with it so far, even if i dont have any idea what im doing
Mollex#9983: <@!709540741315297391> Im new to logic gate so maybe check before trust me...if it works its not optimized anyway
TheAffinity#3062: And the game runs so smoothly on my potato laptop too.
Jimmy#8080: Have fun my friend! Thank you so much for the support ❤️
Broyojo#2667: someone is definitely going to mod real life electrical engineering stuff in logic world
Starficz#7554: came here from another discord, just bought the game. lets see how this stacks up to the other games in the space
TheAffinity#3062: Yay. 😄
Jimmy#8080: Exactly - all that stuff is removed so you can focus on the actual fun part, the logic :D
TheAffinity#3062: One thing I like about this game is that I don't have to worry about power supplies, voltage, ohms, amps and other things that make my head hurt.
anne#6112: Thanks! Will try to google I guess
TheAffinity#3062: Sorry your hand is in pain. I had tunnel carpal surgery back in the 1990s and it was sore for a week.
TheAffinity#3062: Thanks for the quick answer. That's fine. At least I know it's not to do with me being too dumb 😛
Jimmy#8080: You want something called a "pulse limiter". I'd build one to demonstrate myself but hand pain. Can someone else post an example screenshot?
Jimmy#8080: Board placing improvements coming in 0.91 or 0.92, I agree it kind of sucks right now
anne#6112: Is there an easy way to only allow a signal through a circuit for a set amount of time?
TheAffinity#3062: Okay, I still am having trouble stacking boards on top of each other. The auto-orientation is killing me
Funky Egg#5652: #120
Funky Egg#5652: its not hard to find
Funky Egg#5652: lol
Jimmy#8080: oh wait
Jimmy#8080: thanks for linking it so I don't have to go hunting
Funky Egg#5652: i made epik suggestion on the website
Broyojo#2667: nice
Jimmy#8080: cool, should make it for 0.90.1
Broyojo#2667: yes that would be nice
Jimmy#8080: capslock did this in tung
Jimmy#8080: would you like a hotkey to toggle permanent visibility of placement ghosts?
Jimmy#8080: you have to hold down left click
Broyojo#2667: hey how do I turn on placement ghosts?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hit f1
Funky Egg#5652: is there any way to hide hotbar, or to get better ingame screenshots
ieee 802.11ac#6337: no
Mollex#9983: is there a way to fuse 2 board into 1 ?
berry#1313: ty!
pipe01#7194: You can use either a buffer, which propagates the signal instantly, or a 1-tick delayer
berry#1313: is there any easy way to make a one way for signals to go through?
Dredonkey#8601: I didnt realize that thanks, I thought they were supposed to make signals shorter as you could see
Dredonkey#8601: oh ok
circuitgamer77#0377: Buffers only let logic signals progress in one directon, so you don't get feedback.
Dredonkey#8601: I am curious what buffers are for and why people use them in there builds <[newline]>  <[newline]> I set up this circuit and watched it with `server "server.rate 2"` and `server "simulation.rate 2"` ran and it appears both lights turn on after the same amount of ticks (same thing when they have different clocks inputting as well)
Dredonkey#8601: once you drag your mouse far enough out of the action wheel you can release it to click the gear
Dredonkey#8601: gear in the top left while its open
oddron#8955: How do we configure the action wheel?
Dredonkey#8601: thank you
Jimmy#8080: or configure your action wheel to contain the "Pick Up Component" action
Jimmy#8080: ctrl+p on a colored board to add it to your hotbar
Jimmy#8080: base64-encoded binary data
Mollex#9983: <@!146106915338977291>
Mollex#9983: cliock the 3 dots
Mollex#9983: x on the board
Dredonkey#8601: I noticed in the `saves/<save>/players/<player>.succ` file there is this number by entries for boards, and changing it seems to be the color, but I dont know what format this number for the color is in, and wanted to know so I can give myself boards of a custom color. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Or, if there is already a feature to do that ingame, I want to know what it is.
Mollex#9983: im hosting my server on a computer build on my single player world
Michael#8718: that was a joke
Michael#8718: My suggestion is first build a half-adder, then build an 8 core super scaler CPU
Mollex#9983: and bigger
Mollex#9983: and more
Mollex#9983: now u need to create and make more
Mollex#9983: np
4m0nr3#3636: thanks
4m0nr3#3636: nice  !!
Mollex#9983: when u press tab its all there
4m0nr3#3636: hello,  just bought the game.  At the moment I just have a switch,  an inverter, and different PCB layouts. Is that all there is at the moment or are there more items in the current version?  Cheers
Michael#8718: I have not tried MP
Crevette#1444: I'm not hable
Michael#8718: Three way and, with CLK input, into latch ( Nand gates with feedback), into 2 way NAND gate, into Latch
Crevette#1444: How do I play multiplayer?
Michael#8718: I googled JK flip flops to figure out the hookup
Michael#8718: I could not make the simple kind work, so I made a master-slave type
Michael#8718: Making a JK Flip Flop that worked, wasn't simple
Michael#8718: I googled it, and it was cascading JK Flip Flops
Michael#8718: It wasn't simple
Michael#8718: Mr. Ego, I made a binary counter
Mollex#9983: i started there
Mollex#9983: start with looking on how you do addition maybe
Funky Egg#5652: Same
Mollex#9983: im not sure btw im guessing still on the basic stuff
Mollex#9983: full adder is a 2 xor 2 and circuit
Mollex#9983: or something like that
Mollex#9983: after that the output of the full adder goes in the input
Mollex#9983: i never did that im learning but if i need to guess...like a full adder and a pulse on the carry bit  IN
Crevette#1444: How to play in multiplayer?
Funky Egg#5652: Like one that goes 0, 1, 10, 11, 100 etc ect
Funky Egg#5652: I can’t figure out how to
Funky Egg#5652: Also how do you make a binary counter
Funky Egg#5652: I’ll create a account when I get home
Funky Egg#5652: Ok
Ecconia#4929: That opens your browser, where you can log in, if you are not already.
Ecconia#4929: <@!692281400598200331> Top left corner of the main menu, there should be a button for "log in"
Funky Egg#5652: How do you log into a logic world account
TheAffinity#3062: Okay, I have a new question but I'm off for dinner so I won't be able to try the solution until I get back. I noticed while stacking boards will auto-orientate and I'd like to turn that off. Is that possible?
TheAffinity#3062: Oh, I just learned something new. If you place a board on its edge and on top of a board that is flat, it's fused. Using grab on any part treats it like an assembly and not on the part you want to grab. I'll need to remember that.
TheAffinity#3062: OH! I figured it out. To boink it on it's edge it's the T key.
TheAffinity#3062: I think maybe I'm misreading things. Maybe "Board Rotation Up" and "Board Rotation Down" isn't what I think it is supposed to be.
TheAffinity#3062: Hang on. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I need a peg on the board to slap it on it's edge.
TheAffinity#3062: As in along the Y axis.
TheAffinity#3062: No, it's rotating like a straight E and Q keypress.
TheAffinity#3062: "this game is loading lol"...please do not remove that ever.
TheAffinity#3062: Yep that was the culprit. I'll try to remap the rotational keys from Shift+E and Shift+Q to Control+E and Control+Q
TheAffinity#3062: That's possible. I did launch it from my desktop which is open in Explorer view.
Stenodyon#8192: that can happen if you've opened a folder from the game and didn't close the explorer window
circuitgamer77#0377: Can anyone think of data besides RGB data that would be useful for every pixel on a screen?  I have an extra byte per pixel...
TheAffinity#3062: Oh. Weird. It says it's running but it is not. Let me log out of Steam and log back in
TheAffinity#3062: Okay let me give that a shot.
Jimmy#8080: screenshot?
circuitgamer77#0377: In this case the tip of the peg just barely clips the next module's board.
alion02#1973: you can kind of get *higher* pegs right now by just putting them on sides of logic boards or mounts
Mollex#9983: <@!154964593397989376> https://logicworld.net/tracker/116 here check when you have time and better condition <:LogicWorld_pride:587084309454651404>
circuitgamer77#0377: Can an added component or feature in the future be pegs of different heights?  I keep running into places where if I could just get a slightly shorter peg I could fit two boards a tile closer to each other.
Jimmy#8080: bug, please put it on the tracker
Jimmy#8080: <@!246834752328302593> F
oddron#8955: Given a horizontal circuit board, is there a way to flip it over?
alion02#1973: (2) mod is ctrl by default, you can find it in the list of bindings (and rebind it if you so desire)
alion02#1973: (1) t
TheAffinity#3062: Hello everyone.  <[newline]>  <[newline]> I have 2 questions: <[newline]>  <[newline]> The first question is how to rotate a circuit board so it stands on its edge, not on the flat part. The control setup in the game is Shift Q and Shift E but pressing that combination behaves precisely as if Q and E are pressed without the Shift Key. <[newline]>  <[newline]> The final question is that some keys have a MOD reference. I suspect MOD itself is assigned to an actual key but have no idea where that might be. Does anyone know what this is?
alion02#1973: no homo
alion02#1973: love you
alion02#1973: 🙏
circuitgamer77#0377: I think it's ctrl-middle click, but I'm not sure.
alion02#1973: does anyone know how to get colored circuit boards in your hotbar? or preconfigured delayers?
Operu#6600: So it will still store it as bytes but you will read it like it was 32 bits long
circuitgamer77#0377: I want easy-access 32 bit instructions.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think the RAM I build will have both word reading and byte reading options, though...
circuitgamer77#0377: Characters are 1 byte, so it's more efficient to read bytes than words for them.
circuitgamer77#0377: I think it's 8 bits in memory, but they get read in 4 to 8 byte words in some cases.
Operu#6600: Just some basic computer clarification -- <[newline]> Is memory generally stored as bytes and accessed by that specific bytes index. <[newline]> or does each memory cell store 32 bits on a 32 bit system? <[newline]>  <[newline]> If memory cells are 8 bits; <[newline]> how does a modern computer add 2 32 bit numbers, do they just grab four bytes each and add that?
Mollex#9983: o i see the comment
Funky Egg#5652: Does anyone know how
Funky Egg#5652: Typo
Funky Egg#5652: Yea
ieee 802.11ac#6337: i think they meant bug
Mollex#9983: hold click and drag between 1 peg and another

JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: oh ok
Ecconia#4929: As of now you cannot open your game to LAN. You would have to open a dedicated server (which is provided)
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: to open in lan
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: im going to singleplayer but I see no button
JPM-Baroque Spaceship#6542: how to open a LAN server?
Funky Egg#5652: Ah
Stenodyon#8192: if you clone a board it will clone the wires, but if you clone a selection it won't (it's a bug)
Funky Egg#5652: Does anyone know when using clone of you can clone wires
RyanT#1426: ok
Macrohard Onfire#0662: <@!350975527324221451> you have the answer above, in case you don't know where this goes this is in config.succ file in the LogicWorld folder (you can access it from in game in the left bottom corner). you probably then have to reboot the server
Stefan#5422: Ah bless
Jimmy#8080: thankfully yes haha
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Ok, thank you
Jimmy#8080: should look like this <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> Admin_IDs: <[newline]>     - Jimmy <[newline]>     - pipe01 <[newline]> ```
Macrohard Onfire#0662: i mean i put the link to this message
RyanT#1426: oh
Macrohard Onfire#0662: i asked him in <#401255675264761868> and he's reading from older messages so chances are he's gonna find that message and answer
RyanT#1426: <@!154964593397989376>, do you know how to let a user execute serer commands?
kiveon#0480: alright
Radiant#3222: 0.91 is features
Radiant#3222: 0.90.1 is patches
Radiant#3222: Jimmy said he'll implement it with update 0.91
Radiant#3222: i think not
kiveon#0480: anyone?
Macrohard Onfire#0662: well he isn't typing anything so he probably just turned on his computer
Macrohard Onfire#0662: wait jimmy is online
Limón#7879: 😔
Dragon Lord#6944: carpal tunnel go brrrrrRRRRRROWOWOWOWSHITTHEPAIN
Stenodyon#8192: basically his wrists are messed up because of too much typing
Limón#7879: Ah
Stenodyon#8192: repetitive strain injury
Limón#7879: Rsi?
Dragon Lord#6944: he said he'd be taking a break because he's developing an rsi
Stefan#5422: Has jimmy slept for the last 24 hours?
Limón#7879: When will modding be officially supported
Macrohard Onfire#0662: *just watch him come online while i'm asleep so i'll miss my chance to ask
Macrohard Onfire#0662: yeah and he hasn't been online for a while so i'm just waiting until he comes
Stenodyon#8192: I think only Jimmy knows right now
Macrohard Onfire#0662: it's what i'm asking about for quite some time myself
RyanT#1426: does anyone know how to give yourself permission to do server side commands on your server from your client? (I'm trying to change the tick rate on my server)
kiveon#0480: I think I saw somebody mention saving builds. is that a thing?
Broyojo#2667: yeah sadly
Saltypretzel#0321: so no board loading yet?
Stenodyon#8192: Not yet, this feature has been temporarily removed but it will be back soon
Yrk06#4697: Is there a way to import other sandboxes into mine? For example I have a sandbox with a specific machine, then I want to import that machine into another sandbox to use with other systems already developed
oddron#8955: Is there a way to select a component directly from the selection menu and place it in the world, without having to put it the hotbar first?
Stenodyon#8192: you need a binary to BCD converter
Mollex#9983: idk that soz..
LolzDEV#3402: I have an 8 bit cpu and I'd like to read the registers value as decimal
LolzDEV#3402: I saw some 7 segment displays but no one was using 8 bit data
Mollex#9983: try to look in builds section i think someone did it
LolzDEV#3402: is there a way to visualise 8 bit numbers on 3 7-segment displays?
Stenodyon#8192: exclusive pegs have been removed, they were replaced by buffers
iHouqLF#8910: how can I make exclusive pegs?
Mollex#9983: i literally put my pc in exposed host mode (all port open) and still cant open port
Mollex#9983: im lost i cant portforward and idk why sadge
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Still searching for an answer to this. Anyone who owns a server knows how to do it?
Mollex#9983: ill try cya in 5 min
Macrohard Onfire#0662: I had to do that so changes for mc server applied but it's not always necessary i heard
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Did you reboot your router? It sometimes helps (NOT reset, just turn off and on)
Mollex#9983: idk why not open i did the same for stationeer and minecraft server
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Yeah i imagined
Mollex#9983: uh
Mollex#9983: Port 43531 is closed on 83.136.108.23.
Mollex#9983: gonna try right now
Macrohard Onfire#0662: https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Did you try port checker tool? So your friend doesn't have to constantly try logging in until you solve the issue?
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Then i honestly have no idea
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Ok
Mollex#9983: 43531
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Which number
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Port being?
Mollex#9983: im gonna check the firewall now
Mollex#9983: for the portforwarding i just put the protocol and port number on the list like always
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Then it's ports or a firewall
Mollex#9983: i caant make my friend to join
Mollex#9983: yea locally i can already join
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Then you connect with 127.0.0.1 for the ip i think
Macrohard Onfire#0662: Yes
Stenodyon#8192: I just referenced them by color to indicate which parts of the circuit did what
Stenodyon#8192: Oh no the color doesn't affect the function
██#7569: How does changing it to blue change the tick rate on it though?
Mollex#9983: its the building on it
Mollex#9983: its not the board it self that does something
Mollex#9983: he means that the construction on the blue board make 1 think and the orange make anorther one
██#7569: How do you find where what board does what?
Mollex#9983: i can setup the server on the same machine where i play?
Macrohard Onfire#0662: All you should have to do is copy the Server folder to you server (machine) or install steam on your server so it will also auto update and then run the Server file onvyour server. If it then says timed out or something like that you probably didn't port forward correctly or have some other firewall stopping you. I don't know in detail since i didn't set it up myself but that should be how you do it
Mollex#9983: if someone has free time can help me with server setup? i already downloaded the steam file and port forward but still cant join
Macrohard Onfire#0662: my friend is hosting a server and it would be good if we could all use commands such as simulation.rate. So, what do you write here? Names, or is it some ID that can be checked some different way?
Mollex#9983: g on circuit board and r
nalili#7058: Is there a quick way to remove a fast circuit board?
Mollex#9983: in local i can enter the server
Mollex#9983: do i need to set somethig up before run server.exe?
Mollex#9983: quick question i run a server but i cant connect with the public ip?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: copied from FAQ: ```Currently it’s a little awkward and requires the use of console commands. We’ll be adding a nice lovely UI for doing it in the first content update. <[newline]>  <[newline]> If playing on a server, go into the server software and enter the command simulation.rate <ticks per second>. For example, to simulate at 1000 ticks per second, enter simulation.rate 1000. <[newline]>  <[newline]> If playing in singleplayer, open the game console (tilde/backtick - the key just below escape) and enter the command server "simulation.rate <ticks per second>".```
C4io#2688: how can i increase the tick speed?
CrispyPin#1149: also `something fucky is afoot`
CrispyPin#1149: where is that option?
CrispyPin#1149: how do i fix `[Lidgren network server] Lidgren: Socket threw exception; would block - send buffer full? Increase in NetPeerConfiguration`
Operu#6600: is the oracle just a randomizer?
asquared31415#0311: it takes one tick to toggle the top
Mollex#9983: can the relay be used as a 0 tick AND?? is it correct?
LolzDEV#3402: oh okay
oxi#0420: they said that it got removed temporarily and its coming back soon
LolzDEV#3402: is there a way to save circuits and use them in other sandboxes?
Leo3065#5297: Ah I see
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: move it with g then hit r to delete while moving it
Leo3065#5297: currently, what's the fastest way to remove a board with components on it?
asquared31415#0311: so make sure that you don't use the value until it's done
asquared31415#0311: your adder probably has some amount of delay
Mollex#9983: right now im just building some add/subtraction between 2byte so i dont think i need them...but still good to know thanks
asquared31415#0311: because it might be in the wrong state, or flickering as it processes or various things
asquared31415#0311: so if you need to feed that output into something else, you have to make sure to not try to use it before 30 ticks
Mollex#9983: ok perfect thanks
asquared31415#0311: yeah it will have the final output after 30 ticks
Mollex#9983: oh ok thanks
asquared31415#0311: well
asquared31415#0311: yea
Stenodyon#8192: yup
Mollex#9983: the last inverter pulse after 1 second
Mollex#9983: so lets say i put 30 inverter in a row
asquared31415#0311: it's mostly important when you need to time things to make sure you don't use them until they're ready
Stenodyon#8192: most of the time you don't need to know about it really
Stenodyon#8192: a 1 tick pulse is basically a wire being on for 1 game tick (by default that's a 30th of a second) <[newline]> it's good to know about tick lengths when you want to build fast circuits or when you have timing issues <[newline]> most components add a 1 tick delay (e.g. for an inverter the output will turn off 1 tick after the input has been turned on)
Mollex#9983: Guys can someone explain me what 1 tick pulse mean and why should i consider this "tick pulse delay" in building ? im new to this kind of stuff
Stenodyon#8192: (so in total 6 ticks, but you can add more or less delayers to tweak the length)
Stenodyon#8192: the blue board will shorten any pulse to 1 tick, the orange board will add 5 ticks to the pulse
asquared31415#0311: thanks!
Slimepunk#3355: ah, ok
Stenodyon#8192: not yet, this feature has been temporarily removed but it's coming back soon
Stenodyon#8192: 
Slimepunk#3355: is there a way to save boards to bring them to other worlds?
Leo3065#5297: something like this perhaps?
asquared31415#0311: well actually also I will need periodic later but I can figure that out when I need it
asquared31415#0311: single
Stenodyon#8192: single pulse or periodic ?
asquared31415#0311: But ideally customizable
asquared31415#0311: I think I need somewhere between 6 and 10 ticks
asquared31415#0311: How would one create a pulse with a specific length
Stenodyon#8192: multi-place has been temporarily removed, it's coming back soon
Stenodyon#8192: you can use the mouse wheel while dragging to select every other peg, every third peg, and so on
Stenodyon#8192: for multi-wire you have to hold the `Mod` key (left control by default) and left-click + drag over the pegs you want to select (you can only select in a straight line afaik), then left-click + drag over the pegs you want to connect to
Leo3065#5297: Multi place also
Leo3065#5297: I can't figure out how to multiwire
BolkeDer#6969: Thanks
Stenodyon#8192: it's an instant diode, it lets the signal through one way but not the other at no time cost
asquared31415#0311: some sort of control line that disables the input unless it's activated
BolkeDer#6969: How does the Buffer work?
Operu#6600: When building a cpu how do you prevent the result from a math operation to not loop back and potentially add some value to itself hundreds of times?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it seems like discord swallowed the word "random", or I had a stroke
Stoicismus DraMori#5369: not always
asquared31415#0311: or make it light everything or something
asquared31415#0311: Can I move the sun
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: generates a random output when powered
Stoicismus DraMori#5369: what do Oracle gate?
Funky Egg#5652: Then is 4 seperate 4 bit storage’s classed as 16 bits
circuitgamer77#0377: The number of bits is the number of binary digits (that's actually what the word bits is derived from), so if something is 8 bits it has 8 digits (example: 10010010 is 8 bits, 1001 is 4 bits, 100 is 3 bits, etc.)  Binary math works just like decimal math, but with a different number of possible digits, so while in decimal 9999 + 1 = 10000 because the numbers carry, in binary you could have something like 1111 + 1 = 10000 because 1+1 = 2, which can't exist, so you carry the 1, and repeat.
Funky Egg#5652: How do you tell how many bits something is, is it the amount of binary numbers it can hold, for example 0 is 1 bit 10 is 2 but 101 is 3 bit ect ect
Stoicismus DraMori#5369: thanks that work for me
Coda#7350: well i'd like to generate at least a 6 tick pulse
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i guess you could use an and gate too, and just wire the inputs together
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: oh sorry, you already mentioned that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: yes, there's a buffer component (the purple one) which does just that
Funky Egg#5652: You mean a 1 tick clock
Coda#7350: how would i make a clock pulse generator which generates an arbitrary length tick pulse?
lucman64 🇺🇦#5391: ok
geezmolycos#2652: as for other components, idk either
lucman64 🇺🇦#5391: i know thet
geezmolycos#2652: you can multi-place wires by holding ctrl
lucman64 🇺🇦#5391: ok
geezmolycos#2652: so that I don't need to put everything (like 8 full adders) on another board to get them inter-linked
geezmolycos#2652: how can I link a bunch of boards together like a group, like, when you grab one of them, others just get grabbed?
lucman64 🇺🇦#5391: how do you multy place?
sos carbonarre#3314: apparently u can resize the pixels to 2x2
Stoicismus DraMori#5369: Hello i have a question: <[newline]>  <[newline]> I build a small display and i start to program for it characters  <[newline]> but if two characters have this same input to display thay act as one wire is any method to separate wires not using buffor for every wire? becus buffor is very big and i don't have that much space
sos carbonarre#3314: is it possible to make rgb 8bit display currently? it seems like pins sink into each other making it physically impossible to index them
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm having the same problem.
Radiant#3222: Its most probably a bug
Radiant#3222: Very weird
Radiant#3222: Weird
Funky Egg#5652: They don’t though
Radiant#3222: 2 objects wired and cloned *should* remain connected as a clone
MiniStumpy#5653: idk but jimmy is gonna fix a lot of bugs
Funky Egg#5652: Does the delayer use ticks as the delay
Radiant#3222: Not to be confused with 0.90.1
Radiant#3222: When is 0.91 coming out?
CrispyPin#1149: so you can have a removable board that connects to things without having to re-wire
CrispyPin#1149: sockets pass signals to touching sockets
sos carbonarre#3314: what are sockets for? or in general is there a list of all the components and their usage?
Operu#6600: Probably a test and that’s the reason you have to dig to find it in the game files
Ecconia#4929: There is no use repeating the question. Some people here, including Jimmy read all of this channel. Eventually someone knows an answer to the questions and will answer you with a ping.
Funky Egg#5652: Brb but please
Zycrasion#3181: its cool
Zycrasion#3181: what is the purpose of the planets world?
Funky Egg#5652: It would save like a hour
Funky Egg#5652: Please
Funky Egg#5652: ^^^
Funky Egg#5652: But
Funky Egg#5652: Ok
Ecconia#4929: If you want to see all commands run `server "help"`
Funky Egg#5652: ^^^
Funky Egg#5652: Also
Funky Egg#5652: Aka make the game not do logic calc
Funky Egg#5652: I need to know all of this since I’m trying to make a machine that makes the game skip a tick
Funky Egg#5652: It’s still 30 tps
Ecconia#4929: "What is *Single player*?"  - I do not know that number. <[newline]> Run: `server "stats.simulation"` in your client, while in a SP world. <[newline]> (That gives you the default TPS, given you get feedback - and you didn't change it already).
Funky Egg#5652: What about single player
Ecconia#4929: The dedicated server runs at 30 simulation ticks per second by default.
Funky Egg#5652: Ok ty
PseudoGoose#2841: I believe it is 100
Funky Egg#5652: How much tps does the game is slay run at
Funky Egg#5652: When using multi select is there anyway to clone wires
PseudoGoose#2841: It is `server "simulation.rate 100" `
Funky Egg#5652: It seemed right tho
Funky Egg#5652: Hmmmm
Funky Egg#5652: That didn’t work
Ecconia#4929: Oh try "simulation.rate <number>"
Ecconia#4929: I would have to get out of bed for that. <[newline]> Something with "rate <number>", but I also have to look that up.
Funky Egg#5652: <@151293812675706880> what is the command to change tick speed
Ecconia#4929: It's the IP of the machine you are running the server on. <[newline]> Is it a dedicated server? <[newline]> Your home computer? Should it be public in the internet?
melonik#8905: how can i get the ip of server that i created?
Ecconia#4929: <@159884071667761152> exclusive inputs have been removed from the game for good. Some months ago already.
circuitgamer77#0377: Kind of?  It's a one-way logic connection.
brennan#3276: So a buffer basically is a diode?
circuitgamer77#0377: I've been guessing commands to see if anything works...
circuitgamer77#0377: I'm also wondering about that.
Funky Egg#5652: Does anyone know the command to change tick speed and what the ded value is
circuitgamer77#0377: You can use buffers on both inputs, then connect the outputs of the buffers to a peg...  It's gigantic, but instant and simple.
brennan#3276: I'm wanting to use an `OR` gate so I'm using a single peg but it is bidirectional.  This half adder circuit illustrates the problem I'm having.  What's the solution here?  I see there is something called `exclusive input` but I can't figure out the controls for it or how it works.  And I don't see a dedicated `OR` gate anywhere.
Funky Egg#5652: Please I need to know
Funky Egg#5652: And did jimmy mess anything up to the point where I could make a tick suppressor
Funky Egg#5652: And do the delayers for off ticks
Funky Egg#5652: And what is the default tick speed
Funky Egg#5652: <@119734190571913216>
Funky Egg#5652: I forgot
Funky Egg#5652: What is the command to change tick speed
melonik#8905: thanks
Jimmy#8080: It's classified in your steam library as a "tool" instead of a "game", make sure you're looking under tools
Jimmy#8080: Will fix
gnog#2259: for example cloning huge board will just crash the game?
gnog#2259: <@!154964593397989376> Are there any logic that will kick or shutdown when something is not responding for a long time
melonik#8905: but for some reason i dont have this
Saltypretzel#0321: I am pretty sure there is some discussion about that in the beginning of the channel
melonik#8905: please someone
sos carbonarre#3314: ok seems like yea
sos carbonarre#3314: hm, is modding already doable?
Saltypretzel#0321: I think that’s a mod/later update thing.
sos carbonarre#3314: is there a way to fetch contents of a file to some sort of ROM?
melonik#8905: how can i make a server please?
Jimmy#8080: Some components cannot be fine rotated
circuitgamer77#0377: For some reason the fine rotate keybind isn't working for me...  It just snaps to 90 degree increments as if I was just using the rotate key.
Jimmy#8080: Alternatively - configure your Action Wheel to contain the "pick up component" action, that's what you want to use
Jimmy#8080: Ctrl+middle click on a colored circuit board
brennan#3276: I want to change the color of the circuit board in my hotbar.
circuitgamer77#0377: Can you clarify?  I think we're thinking of different menus...
circuitgamer77#0377: Maybe I misunderstood...
brennan#3276: Don't see any 3 dots.  Can you elaborate?
circuitgamer77#0377: I think it's the bar with three dots on the top of that menu?
brennan#3276: I accidentally overwrote the other color circuit boards in the hotkey menu.  How can I save other colors in the hotkey bar.  All I have available now is the white color.
circuitgamer77#0377: Is there a way to smoothly rotate a board on the ground?
brennan#3276: What are the controls for multi-wire placement?
gotenks917#3427: thanks
ieee 802.11ac#6337: hit t
gotenks917#3427: i may be dumb but how do i get boards to lay flat?
Saltypretzel#0321: How come i cannot rotate sockets?
Limón#7879: This
ArbysSauce#8865: Is there a balance reason why XOR gates are larger than ANDs?
Limón#7879: Where are the script files stored for the mod
Funky Egg#5652: Anyway does anyone have a binary counter blueprint
Munashe#3730: saving us from buffer spam
Limón#7879: 1 tile vs like 5
Munashe#3730: based modder chad
Limón#7879: It's bigger than I want
Funky Egg#5652: It’s tiny
Funky Egg#5652: No it’s not
Limón#7879: And fail™️
Limón#7879: It's too big to make
Limón#7879: I am adding or gate to the game
Zephi#4594: no problem buddy :)
Funky Egg#5652: What latches
Limón#7879: :)
Limón#7879: Ty
Zephi#4594: folder*
Zephi#4594: oh ok then
Limón#7879: Where is the mods folder
Munashe#3730: AND gates and latches
Limón#7879: I meant to say mods folder
Zephi#4594: are*
Limón#7879: Is*
Funky Egg#5652: How do I make a binary counter
Zephi#4594: are*
Zephi#4594: where is the mods
Limón#7879: Where is the mods
RyanT#1426: <@154964593397989376>, can you make it so all verifed owners of lw can download the server software from lw.net? This way server owners won't have to install steam
Mollex#9983: np remember u can press f to flip the wires...hard to explain just try...you need that if you invert the order of the selection
Kahyxen#0001: Thanks!
Mollex#9983: np
Bumpy#3920: aight, thanks
Mollex#9983: <@!143177692802580480> try to read in the logic world chat...i think jimmy said its a removed feature for now...
Bumpy#3920: Is it possible to save boards similar to how you could in TUNG?
Mollex#9983: <@!690661774567014400> did u get it?
Mollex#9983: 1) hold ctrl and select your frst line of peg <[newline]> 2) now u can select your second line of peg normally <[newline]> 3) they should connect, you can use scroll wheel to change the interval of the connections
Kahyxen#0001: How do you do multi wire placing?
Kahyxen#0001: thanks!
Biggycheese69420#4947: server "simulation.rate 100"
Kahyxen#0001: how do you change the tick speed?
Kahyxen#0001: Thanks!
Red_3D#3062: `noclip`
Biggycheese69420#4947: `
Kahyxen#0001: How do you open the console, and what do you type?
Red_3D#3062: yes, it can be activated in the console (and there might be a keybind but I am not sure about that. you can check in the settings menu)
Kahyxen#0001: hey is there no-clip?
Compilatron#6231: I asked Jimmy - blotters were too OP so he nerfed them
Red_3D#3062: you can hold a modifier key (I think shift or ctrl) for fine rotation
Red_3D#3062: or just set the tickspeed to 1 and play around with the components
Munashe#3730: Is there way to rotate chips by less than 45(?) degree increments?
Compilatron#6231: *cracks nuckles* time to break out DNSpy to find out
Red_3D#3062: I think currently not but you can always ask here
Munashe#3730: Is there any place to find which are which?
Red_3D#3062: all except the delayer are either one or zero
Munashe#3730: Is there somewhere that lists the tick delay for each component, or are they all just 0, 1, or delay(tick count) ?
Red_3D#3062: you can create a feature request on the issue tracker <https://logicworld.net/tracker/game> <[newline]> or just yeet it into <#401255675264761868>
Mutz03Zockt#3772: hey, is there a suggestions channel somwhere? <[newline]> because i jsut had an idea
Saltypretzel#0321: inverters have equivalent delay to 1 delay in a delayer?
Compilatron#6231: *why is it so big?* <[newline]>  <[newline]> I miss the blotter... what happened to it?
Munashe#3730: The purple buffer
Compilatron#6231: pegs can fed backwards - I need something like a diode
Red_3D#3062: pegs
Compilatron#6231: What can I use in place of a blotter, for the sake of routing signals?
Munashe#3730: https://www.nand2tetris.org/
samuelroyer93#2447: Does anyone have any documentation or link to help find ideas for a project?
Mollex#9983: is it possible to put the xor gate in a vertical poistion  on a flat surface?
Operu#6600: Yesss
Operu#6600: Obviously
Compilatron#6231: If you can "create a new sandbox" does that imply there will be a survival LW?
berry#1313: thank you!
Red_3D#3062: create a connection other sockets if the blue parts are touching <https://youtu.be/x7Exruogc3g>
berry#1313: what does the socket part do?
Munashe#3730: That is the problem
alion02#1973: then yeah it kinda sucks
alion02#1973: unless you have multiple such inputs to the "OR gate"
alion02#1973: 
Munashe#3730: Yes, but we're just adding more components, when the AND gate is simple and compact in comparison.
alion02#1973: you can just put a buffer between the ORing part and the part that can't have signals flowing backwards through it
Munashe#3730: rip
Funky Egg#5652: I can’t get my server to work
Red_3D#3062: Ok, I think using multiple Buffers really is the intended solution. This makes me sad
Nik#1011: and isn't related to logic world, you can find better info online if you google it
Nik#1011: and costs money
Nik#1011: that is very complicated
Funky Egg#5652: Ok 1 last thing how do I get a domain for the server
Nik#1011: you can find all kinds of tutorials online for how to do port forwarding for a game server
Nik#1011: well, yes but only if you set up port forwarding in your network router
Funky Egg#5652: Is that the server ip
FalsePattern#7777: you can find your ip address by googling "what is my ip"
Red_3D#3062: I think gates are defined as logical operators rn
Funky Egg#5652: How do I find my server ip and how do I get a perm ip/domain
Munashe#3730: If the game is easily modded, and the AND gate is just defined by a truth table, then maybe someone can mod one in.
Red_3D#3062: we once had a solution to this called exclusive pegs but they are gone for good. lemme see what the explanation for that was
Munashe#3730: 
Red_3D#3062: ohh
Munashe#3730: The point is that the inputs will flow into other inputs
Munashe#3730: That's not the point
Munashe#3730: There it is
Munashe#3730: 
Red_3D#3062: thats what caused me headaches with it once
Munashe#3730: Maybe I was using the wrong direction in the past? I'm a bit confused now
Red_3D#3062: steam/steamapps/common/Logic World Dedicated Server
Funky Egg#5652: Where is the server executable
Munashe#3730: Nevermind
Verlio_H#0201: you should be able to
Red_3D#3062: wait what, lemme try
Munashe#3730: You can't
Red_3D#3062: you can connect all levers to one buffer but I still totally agree
Munashe#3730: It's also a lot more components to fiddle with
Munashe#3730: The OR gate seems a bit messy and bulky compared to a more complex AND gate
Munashe#3730: 
Funky Egg#5652: Oh
Red_3D#3062: 
Funky Egg#5652: <@151293812675706880>
Funky Egg#5652: How do I enable the tools visibility
Funky Egg#5652: Ty
Ecconia#4929: <@!692281400598200331> server hosting instructions
Red_3D#3062: hmm, I agree that the shape of the buffer is a a little strange and its hard to work with. Maybe its form should be reevaluated from the perspective of an or gate
Munashe#3730: I'm not suggesting that tons of components be added to negate the point of the game, but an OR gate is a very basic gate
Munashe#3730: I'm aware, but that is unwieldy compared to an OR gate component in the same form factor as the AND.
Red_3D#3062: The buffer can accept multiple inputs and limits the flow direction of the signal. It just looks very unconverntional
Munashe#3730: An OR gate doesn't let one of the input legs affect the other inputs
Red_3D#3062: hmm, I understand your point but dont think adding an or gate would be a great solution. <[newline]> I think of pegs (both the component itself and component inputs in the same shape) as or gates and I could imagine the planned "Challange mode" would introduce them with that in mind
Munashe#3730: It's clearly caused confusion among people unfamiliar with the game
Munashe#3730: It's more standard to have an OR gate than to have wires connect and cause feedback up the chain
Red_3D#3062: could you elaborate on that? in which situation would this component be useful.
Munashe#3730: I know you can use pegs and buffers, but a dedicated OR gate in the same form factor as the AND gate would be convenient
Red_3D#3062: the ability to multi place components was recently removed but should be back soon, better than ever
Red_3D#3062: <https://youtu.be/6P6E4Sj5qMs> I think the modifier key you have to press to activate the selection is ctrl
Mollex#9983: ok thanks i will try
Michael#8718: And crossover wires
Michael#8718: There's this mount thing, that you can mount a peg onto
Michael#8718: Wires can be blocked by other wires though
Michael#8718: You can connect multiple wires to the same terminal
Mollex#9983: how do you multi wire? is there a way to multi place component too?
Verlio_H#0201: I feel like jimmy should put that somewhere cause like 10 people have asked that
Covalessence#2219: thanks!
Covalessence#2219: Thansk!
alion02#1973: ((if you need to fix that, use buffers))
Covalessence#2219: I was really struggling to make basic gates 😄
alion02#1973: (be careful of signals going the wrong way though)
Covalessence#2219: Oh, ok 😄 that makes everything easy all of a sudden
alion02#1973: just hook up multiple wires to one input and 🎉
alion02#1973: pegs are OR gates
Covalessence#2219: Hey, I'm really new to stuff like this. Is there no regular OR gate or can you easily just make that yourself?
PseudoGoose#2841: I read the entire controls list and I _still_ fumble around  <[newline]> i guess tbf it's still the first day and my brain is still hardwired for TUNG
Michael#8718: E and Q don't work
Michael#8718: Flip doesn't work
Michael#8718: I can't seem to rotate buffers
Jimmy#8080: Once 0.90 is fixed we're going to take a vacation for a few weeks, and after that I want to ship about 1 update every month. Aiming for 0.91 in December!
Radiant#3222: When is 0.91 coming out?
Ecconia#4929: Buy LogicWorld on Steam. <[newline]> Enable the "tools" visibility. <[newline]> Open the folder with the files of the server tool. <[newline]> Copy them all to wherever you want to run the server. But keep them in a sub-folder of where you want it to actually run. <[newline]> Move the `GameData` folder from that subfolder into the parent folder. (the one you run it in). <[newline]> Start it once using the "Server" executable file. (On Linux no file ending). <[newline]> Check your settings in `config.succ` and adjust things. <[newline]> If you do not want a grass world, upload another world and put it into the created `saves` folder. (Name in config files above) <[newline]> Now you can start it for real again. Have fun.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: and probably a pain to filter only the currently available actions, appreciate that effort ❤️
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: very useful
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: oh I did read it
Jimmy#8080: How do I make something that players will actually read
Jimmy#8080: I've been watching people play and nobody fucking reads that LOL
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (press f6 to bring up the keybind menu to show you what actions are available)
Saltypretzel#0321: thanks
Saltypretzel#0321: ah okay
Red_3D#3062: press `t`  while placing it
Saltypretzel#0321: how to place circuit board flat?
Michael#8718: thanks!
Red_3D#3062: no, but you may use a mount or vertical circuitboard
Michael#8718: To get over another wire?
Michael#8718: can you stack pegs?
Michael#8718: I will give it a shot 🙂
Michael#8718: ok
Red_3D#3062: timers can be build using delayers
Michael#8718: I know there's a delay
Michael#8718: Can a timer be built?
Michael#8718: thanks
Michael#8718: Yes, understood
Verlio_H#0201: buffer is a diode, pegs are not
Michael#8718: Yeah, well out of the gate, it's good tool to learn some basic logic circuits
Michael#8718: I think it's cool, will take some learning
Red_3D#3062: A challange mode in which you are slowly introduced to everything is planned
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if you don't want the signal to power both wires, you need to use buffers. otherwise, you don't
Michael#8718: The game could have a clicky, to explain how to build a half adder
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: depends on your use case
Michael#8718: In that case, then no buffer is needed?
Michael#8718: Ah, I see what you mean, thanks
Verlio_H#0201: an or gate is simply 2 wires connected to a peg
Michael#8718: Thanks
Verlio_H#0201: they are
Michael#8718: So people can google the full adder, and build it easily
Michael#8718: One suggestion I have, if the dev reads this, to ensure the gates for making a full adder are available
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (if you want them to only go one way: use a buffer)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or gate is just connecting wires together
Red_3D#3062: we have and, xor, d-latch... <[newline]> or is just multiple wires running into one peg
Michael#8718: Is there any premade circuits, like Or gate?
Verlio_H#0201: lol d latches look like boats
Deleted User#0000: This is great I got it working thanks
Saltypretzel#0321: oh okay thanks
Red_3D#3062: ?
Saltypretzel#0321: what is d latch pinout logic world?
Deleted User#0000: oh ok
Red_3D#3062: the simplest version is just an inverter hooked into itself with a delayer in between
Deleted User#0000: or even just the parts involved and maybe I can figure it out
Deleted User#0000: Nah just the most simplest that there is for a newb like myself
Red_3D#3062: ah, there are many different designs. Is being able to toggle it on / off a requirement?
Deleted User#0000: Yeah I want to have a switch or a button that turns on and off at a particular interval
Red_3D#3062: could you elaborate? I am not entirely sure what you mean
Deleted User#0000: How do you repeat a signal?
Verlio_H#0201: sockets show the power of friendship
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: sockets work by rubbing the blue parts together
Red_3D#3062: some of the older ones are not entirely accurate anymore but its a great way to get a feel for everything
Limón#7879: I am just gonna watch all of the videos
Red_3D#3062: ^ > <https://youtu.be/x7Exruogc3g>
Limón#7879: How do the sockets work?
Laefye#2763: Oh, 😋 So I will poke into the game. Maybe something will work
Jimmy#8080: as I said, neither is officially supported yet and we won't be providing help with it. Use at your own risk
Jimmy#8080: so does c# if you know what you're doing
Laefye#2763: But LogicScript works <:thenking:446109302369812490>
Jimmy#8080: neither is officially supported yet
Laefye#2763: At the moment Logic World can load C# code for mods, or only LogicScript?
Jimmy#8080: Great suggestion, thanks, can you put it on the tracker?
bejoscha#0284: Indeed it does. I think the items shouldn't be shown on the dialog if there is only a single peg connection. It was just utterly confusing.
katkosmos#6502: Answered my own question with a bit of experimentation lol: The server relies on the `GameData` folder also being present in the parent directory.
Jimmy#8080: Jump into the support voice chat
katkosmos#6502: Is the server relocatable or does it rely on the game being installed? Basically just wondering if I'm able to stick the server folder onto a VPS
Jimmy#8080: It'll make sense if you do it for a display with 3+ pegs
Verlio_H#0201: what will happen to <#588822987331993602>
wildvine#3827: how friend join server
ThrilledTear#8448: can somebody walk me through making a server
bejoscha#0284: I have **no clue** what the display panel configuration edit for "set all states" does. Seems not do do anything different than setting the active color? HELP !
DanielGJ44#4557: how much dedicated ram do I need to run the server
alion02#1973: or copy multiple boards and place them without them tripping out?
alion02#1973: can i clone a board and paste it multiple times?
Jimmy#8080: Default port is 43531
wildvine#3827: is there any ports to open or anything like that
Jimmy#8080: - xor is more complicated than AND <[newline]> - different component shapes make for interesting gameplay <[newline]> - different component shapes make them easier to distinguish visually at a glance (as you mentioned)
Verlio_H#0201: accessability?
Limón#7879: so you can take a look at it and know what it is by shape
Limón#7879: Is it to show uniqueness
Limón#7879: Why are xor gates 2 wide while and gates are 1 wide
Verlio_H#0201: why would anyone have questions
Jimmy#8080: 
wildvine#3827: how to server
Jimmy#8080: why game bad
