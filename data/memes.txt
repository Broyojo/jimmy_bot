Justin#2534: Only difference in installation is you download steam from an app store basically
Justin#2534: I mean Ubuntu + Steam isn't too bad
MilkTe.ch#9621: theres a reason why a lot of IT guys use linux, its because its made for IT guys
MilkTe.ch#9621: imma be honest with you if you dont wanna switch to linux dont switch to linux, the switch has wayyy to many headaches to really be worth it
MilkTe.ch#9621: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/930230100111278090/949638599278739476/lv_0_202203020048400.mp4

MilkTe.ch#9621: if you mod a lot and use mod managers
MilkTe.ch#9621: also extra warning
MilkTe.ch#9621: funni
MilkTe.ch#9621: so does MS edge
MilkTe.ch#9621: ms teams has an official linux version
Justin#2534: It's easy to think of all the things that could go wrong, like Linux can go into grub rescue just like Windows can bluescreen
Justin#2534: Customizing stuff and getting stuff working on Linux is pretty fun if you're in the mood for it imo. But if something isn't working and you're just trying to do the one thing that isn't working, it's annoying
MilkTe.ch#9621: also realised it now but wrong reply smh
MilkTe.ch#9621: linux isnt obscure because people think its bad or unfit for their porpuse, linux is not used because nobody knows what a computer is
MilkTe.ch#9621: even apex legends which did work for a bit had an update disable anti-cheat on linux
MilkTe.ch#9621: of course the big games dont work because they are highly competitive online games
MilkTe.ch#9621: for list of steam games
MilkTe.ch#9621: https://protondb.com
MilkTe.ch#9621: as crispy said depends per genre, fighting games work well since most of them have been made in japan and they've recently figured out that people want to play fighting games online, games for nerds (factorio and logic world) usually have linux builds and run native, if you add anti-cheat in a single player game you will get beaten to death
Justin#2534: I used to play classic WoW on Lutris for example with no issues
Justin#2534: I'm switching back to Linux soon. Only game I play that I know doesn't work is Valorant, but that's because the anticheat is basically a rootkit that only works on Windows
Justin#2534: Steam has a built in compatibility layer for all of it's games, most Windows games outside of that can be ran in the Lutris launcher
Reese4221#8317: ya cant get BYOND working üòî
CrispyPin#1149: the majority of games work in proton but it depends on the genre, several popular games with anticheat still don't work
Reese4221#8317: and some games just dont work at all
Reese4221#8317: proton or dont use games that dont support linux
trucksarenoisy#4659: I do know proton or smthn exists
trucksarenoisy#4659: I use windows 10. I need to know how people game on linux when most games do not support linix

jackson535#1361: here take this lag machine
jackson535#1361: this was all an interesting and somewhat gruesome discussion
Hugin#2596: not an outside body entering your body but there's this thing where your(pardon my great translation to english) achilles muscle rips cartilage on the heel apart <[newline]> sadly, it is definitely not as dramatic nor dynamic nor painful as it sounds tho it is pretty annoying
jackson535#1361: thats horrible
jackson535#1361: what about a splintering part of a wood floor embedding itself into your foot horizontally
Hugin#2596: from all the relatable experiences, like, hair splinters(I never experienced it, kinda curious), flints, sticks, dry tree needles, rusty nails/other rusty fractures, bottle caps and such <[newline]> I think the worst is walking on cobblestone or similar while it's 50+ deg hot because sun is a thing <[newline]> extremely unpleasant when combined with the fact that you feel heat with a big delay and are already few meters away from the edge and have to make it <[newline]> don't ask how I got into this situation, it's a long story that has the potential to help dox me

Saltypretzel#0321: Stepping on an old Italian phone plug is worst
jackson535#1361: and is definitely self-tapping
jackson535#1361: my wood screws
Stefan#5422: Also I'm not talking about the machine screws I'm talking about self tapping wood screws
Stefan#5422: The betrayal is there if its the screw that you left there lying after you finished whatever you were doing
GHXX#9078: a screw wont always sit with the tip up
GHXX#9078: and also, a lego brick will hurt no matter what orientation its in
jackson535#1361: screws were always your enemy
GHXX#9078: a screw on the other hand is always considered sharp
jackson535#1361: facts
GHXX#9078: a lego brick seems soo nice, but when you step on it oh boy
jackson535#1361: maybe the point-source pain if it goes through your foot a little is less than the pain of almost puncturing your foot over a much larger surface area
GHXX#9078: but the betrayal isnt there at all
jackson535#1361: are you sure
Stefan#5422: (even if it doesnt get stuck in your foot)
Stefan#5422: Stepping on a screw is way fucking worse
GHXX#9078: stepping on lego is the ultimate betrayal

Lim√≥n#7879: seems like it equals 1
Lim√≥n#7879: b/b :trolling_emoticon:
ThePiGuy24#0369: its a standard, its sorta meant to be
PseudoGoose#2841: what, you think I've been trying to make something useful this whole time?
ThePiGuy24#0369: no, but it makes it useless
PseudoGoose#2841: does that disprove the equation?
ThePiGuy24#0369: as you are not disambiguating, both of those evaluate to 1
PseudoGoose#2841: this is a perfect system of measurement with absolutely no flaws
PseudoGoose#2841: QED
PseudoGoose#2841: which is obviously true
PseudoGoose#2841: (banana^2 / banana^2) (force) = (banana / banana) (force)
ThePiGuy24#0369: smh you are still being ambiguous about which property you are referring to, how do you think people are going take this standard seriously if it is impossible to communicate
PseudoGoose#2841: and also this
PseudoGoose#2841: force: banana * banana / banana^2
PseudoGoose#2841: but using that (and mass):
PseudoGoose#2841: actually that is correct
PseudoGoose#2841: DERP
PseudoGoose#2841: acceleration: bananas per banana squared
PseudoGoose#2841: speaking of mass
Dragon Lord#6944: Ah, my b <[newline]> 'A standard sample of potassium is radioactive'*
ThePiGuy24#0369: wouldnt work, that would change its mass
ThePiGuy24#0369: correction, some isotopes of potassium are radioactive
Dragon Lord#6944: I imagine a standard banana being stored in formaldehyde
ThePiGuy24#0369: so like banana[e] for energy or banana[t] for time
Dragon Lord#6944: Potassium is radioactive :)
ThePiGuy24#0369: using bananas for multiple units is fine as long as you make it clear as to which property you are referring to
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah
Dragon Lord#6944: I know there's BER (banana equivalent radiation)
PseudoGoose#2841: so now we can have bananas (energy) per banana (length) = unit of force
PseudoGoose#2841: so there is also bananas (unit of length)
PseudoGoose#2841: you know how people use bananas "for scale"?
PseudoGoose#2841: there's more
PseudoGoose#2841: but wait

ThePiGuy24#0369: no
PseudoGoose#2841: bananas (energy) per banana (time)

PseudoGoose#2841: times bananas (energy)

PseudoGoose#2841: and then
PseudoGoose#2841: so you could have a banana-based unit of power while having a separate banana-based unit of time
PseudoGoose#2841: just different properties of a banana
PseudoGoose#2841: no they're not interrelated
ThePiGuy24#0369: for example, watts is joules per second
ThePiGuy24#0369: for a unit of power, it would be ? per banana, with ? being a unit of energy
ThePiGuy24#0369: bananas is a unit of time, so bananas per hour would be a constant rather than a unit
PseudoGoose#2841: A new proposal for JSO (Jimmy Standards Organization): We already have bananas as a unit of time. But what about bananas per hour for a unit of power? <[newline]> <@!154964593397989376>  <[newline]> (https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/ROCK64#Power_Draw)

PseudoGoose#2841: I don't know if you can "revoke" a license agreement
PseudoGoose#2841: I am not a lawyer of course, but that is my understanding of it. Because there are some projects that started open source, turned commercial, and still have open source forks of their old code.
PseudoGoose#2841: Whatever code was available under the old license will still be available under the old license. Any newer changes will be licensed by the current license.
Lim√≥n#7879: any lawyers trying to provide ***not*** legal advice?
DjSapsan#4530: I guess no

[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: and then there would be the one where iron man guy is pointing at himself and the caption would be "Alpha particles can't penetrate the normal layer of dead cells on the outside of our skin but can damage the cornea of the eye. Alpha-particle radiation is normally only a safety concern if the radioactive decay occurs from an atom that is already inside the body or a cell. Alpha-particle emitters are particularly dangerous if inhaled, ingested, or if they enter a wound."
[Pre-Scratch] le#1337: so its the guy from incredibles i think where he has the one where he is smiling and the disturbed one, and the smiling one would have the caption "Me when i am holding an alpha particle emitter" and the disturbed one would be "me when i ingest an alpha particle emitter"

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: (N) in parenthesis for if it wasnt L2, and N gets tied to earth at the breaker box
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: just like in usa you dont get 220V you get 208V because its between L1 and L2, and L1 and L2 arent 180* out of phase
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: you can generate 400V in between 2 phases of a larger voltage system
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: uhm youre entirely wrong <a:KEKWgif:829851650717909094>
GHXX#9078: because it (almost) has no voltage difference to PE
GHXX#9078: funnily enough, N can actually be seen as GND
GHXX#9078: so calling it L2 would be more confusing
GHXX#9078: L2 is already used by 400V connectors
GHXX#9078: and L2 is def wrong
GHXX#9078: you can call it whatever
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: <a:LMFAOOO:789693672337834005>

Saltypretzel#0321: since an incandescent lamp is a PTC device
Saltypretzel#0321: well usuaully one uses an incandescent lamp for current limiting
GHXX#9078: hm, usually one would overvoltage protectors, which can either be diodes or it could also be implemented using distance, where an arc would be able to jump over if the voltage is too high
doodocina#5040: kills not V but A
doodocina#5040: yes
GHXX#9078: like overvoltage?
GHXX#9078: percussion?
doodocina#5040: in general, the lamp protects the transformer from percussion if it is designed, for example, for 110V
GHXX#9078: but yeah, <@!473472395802312705> be careful with such voltages
Lim√≥n#7879: I was close
GHXX#9078: youd check both coils and make sure the resistance is not infinite, but more than 0.1 Ohms
GHXX#9078: but it lets you measure the resistance and whatnot
GHXX#9078: over here we call it "multimeter", idk if thats the proper english term
GHXX#9078: if you want to check a transformer, get a voltmeter
doodocina#5040: its 10 for russia üòÑ
GHXX#9078: so P = I^2 * R
doodocina#5040: it seems this way of checking the transformer was widespread only in the ussr. i havent found anything like this on the english-speaking YT
GHXX#9078: and U = R * I
GHXX#9078: P = U * I
Lim√≥n#7879: isn't it like P = IR^2 or something
Lim√≥n#7879: what is the formula for watts
GHXX#9078: ish üòõ
Lim√≥n#7879: electricity is complicated
GHXX#9078: but at the end of the day its also about the wattage behind it
GHXX#9078: one of the two
GHXX#9078: or was it 15 <:Thinkies:609112411966013460>
GHXX#9078: 30mA at 30V for 30ms is dangerous they say
GHXX#9078: to get it for the 400V side just multiply by 230 and divide by 400
Lim√≥n#7879: doesn't 15mA kill you
Lim√≥n#7879: funny amounts
GHXX#9078: usually 13A or 16A for the 230V

Broyojo#2667: yeah they are sort of relying on the fact that no one will go through the click chain to get to read the paper
Saltypretzel#0321: the title isnt even remotely related
Saltypretzel#0321: not really pircay but maybe it is idk
Saltypretzel#0321: ill dm it
Saltypretzel#0321: oh piracy is TOS breaking nvm
Saltypretzel#0321: this doesnt talk about EMF at all lol
Saltypretzel#0321: yeah these claims are kinda bogus. There still isnt super conclsuive research that it causes harm. Usually the studies are garbage and have some very barely significant data
Broyojo#2667: this is definitely a weird rabbit hole though
Broyojo#2667: very sus though
Broyojo#2667: I can't purchase the pdf to see it though
Broyojo#2667: this one I don't think mentions laptops and emf, at least from the abstract
Broyojo#2667: yeah they used this paper as evidence of other researchers agreeing with one paper that they didn't link to: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019745809500072M#aep-keywords-id8
Broyojo#2667: but yes let me actually look
Broyojo#2667: yes studies show that people with laptops have less sperm
WhyNot?#2534: yeah, just gonna set my hot laptop on my balls XD
WhyNot?#2534: if i remember a tom scott video correctly (i havent looked into myself but hes probably pretty reliable assuming i remember what he said XD) that we get more background radiation from our surroundings than from phones so even more bs from these companies that upset me. and ill have to look the guy up but another youtuber sometimes buys these products and tests them for radiation, as in from uranium and stuff and they almost always are radioactive
Broyojo#2667: let me look at it more
Broyojo#2667: this tinnitus thing
Broyojo#2667: also the study they use for this looks kinda sus
Broyojo#2667: yes
WhyNot?#2534: but it does let you read what they claim it can do
Broyojo#2667: hmm I wonder if this is true
Broyojo#2667: doesn't let you read it
Broyojo#2667: oh yeah that is really bad
WhyNot?#2534: intentionally scrolling their counter making it hard to read is so scummy
Broyojo#2667: supposedly this is where their evidence is from
Broyojo#2667: the studies part may be interesting https://www.defendershield.com/learn/studies
Broyojo#2667: yeah that is probably true

Broyojo#2667: yes
Broyojo#2667: yea maybe german

Zephi#4594: you clearly üôÑ
RyanT#1426: who the f*** searched "16 bit binary to bcd in harry potter"??!!
Zephi#4594: oh shit
Zephi#4594: wait if god exists and put everything into place doesn't that make every one of our languages a conlang
Zephi#4594: whatever the reason, i'm sure there is an easy one-sentence answer that i was too stupid to think of that disproves that video games are amazing translation devices lmao
Zephi#4594: maybe i do it so that no continued discussion -- that i can't take much part in because of time and my stupidity -- will be spawned without risk of "why are we talking about this in <#403343343775383552>"
Zephi#4594: maybe i doubt the seriousness of my thoughts
Zephi#4594: i wonder why i said this in <#403343343775383552>
Zephi#4594: considering how we haven't yet found our corresponding godlang i don't think they would be able to either
Zephi#4594: maybe using the way the world was built to extrapolate other information from that who knows
Zephi#4594: maybe in-lore they would seek out the language of their creators and create a corresponding translation device from their "con"lang to the "god"lang
Zephi#4594: and if they are aware, then they still may consider it a valid language
Zephi#4594: but unless the characters in the game are aware of their creators, then it's a perfectly valid language at least to them
Zephi#4594: sure in our universe it seems like a conlang (possibly with no speakers because the language itself wasn't developed in our universe but rather the game's and we never get to see the language pre translation)
Zephi#4594: "ah but those languages are just constructed for the world they live in"
Zephi#4594: there's an incredibly low chance that people in those universes speak the language that the player has set the game to be translated to
Zephi#4594: video games set in fantasy universes are the most advanced language translators humanity has ever created

Broyojo#2667: except more secure
Broyojo#2667: it is just sort of like ownership of paintings I guess
Broyojo#2667: with nfts though counterfeits cannot be made and sold since they can know for sure that those are counterfeits
cheese3660#8641: All my homies hate nfts

This schematic may deliberately include fake component symbols, so that the company can distinguish candidates who have the humility to admit they don't know everything from candidates who think they know it all and are willing to guess or make up answers.

DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah I know that's standard in countries like that
oddron#8955: Here in the US, we generally don't have such protections. A landlord can choose to not renew a lease without needing a reason.

DanielGJ44#4557: Obviously one needs to accept that they need to put money in to maintain a standard of living, but I have a feeling that this title was cropped to exclude important details about the specific situaion
DanielGJ44#4557: In my country you have to renew a lease within like 5% of the previous one if it's with the same tenant, and you can't NOT renew the lease with a tenant without cause, so this might be what they are talking about
Stenodyon#8192: they're confusing their revenue with profits
Stenodyon#8192: I think they're angry at the fact they have to use any of the money they got from the rent at all lol
oddron#8955: Tell them this: If the rent is not enough to maintain the apartment while maintaining sufficient ROI, then it's time to raise the rent. It might be a good idea to just not renew the tenant's lease, renovate the unit, and put it back on the market. Next time don't be a slumlord üòõ

oddron#8955: Exactly
FalsePattern#7777: quoting the article: <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> McCollough originally reported that these aftereffects may last for an hour or more. Jones and Holding (1975) found that with repeated testing of the effect, the effect itself diminishes; subjects inducted for 15 minutes and then tested several times over the course of a few days lost the effect within 5 days, but those inducted for the same time but not exposed to testing until 85 days later retained the effect.```
oddron#8955: I have heard of this. The crazy thing is, the effect can persist for *months* after staring at the grids
FalsePattern#7777: 
FalsePattern#7777: so i went down into a bit of a rabbit hole from this, and found something that's actually freaky: the mccollough effect <[newline]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollough_effect <[newline]> basically, you can program your brain to perceive colors between black and white stripes just by staring at opposite colored horizontal and vertical stripes for a few minutes (at least 3), alternating about every 10 seconds. This isn't just persistence of vision, it works no matter the size of the grids

Zaxabock#0013: And then there's
Zaxabock#0013: Frontends have to cater to the public after all
Zaxabock#0013: I thought of it more like, backends do whatever it takes to achieve things, so they aren't used to obstacles that can't be changed ü§≠
PseudoGoose#2841: it goes a little deeper, because packing suitcase in 3D == laying out a webpage in 2D i guess
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
Dragon Lord#6944: oh, that's accurate
PseudoGoose#2841: the surface-level joke basically is that backend devs don't know how to HTML (alluding to a `<div>` tag)
Dragon Lord#6944: is this some web dev joke i'm too on the metal to understand?

Red_3D#3062: what makes it wrong? I agree with the confusing part tho
CrispyPin#1149: but thats also wrong/confusing
Red_3D#3062: well, you can
CrispyPin#1149: by that logic you'd say one zero for 10
Verlio_H#0201: or just say thirty-three
Red_3D#3062: then you'd have to say three three
Verlio_H#0201: me converting a 64 bit binary number to decimal in my head so I can say it outloud
CrispyPin#1149: like saying twenty-seven makes no sense if you're talking about 33 in base 8
Red_3D#3062: never
CrispyPin#1149: but at what point do you stop?
Red_3D#3062: like how 0b10 is still two
Red_3D#3062: wouldnt 10 in base 8 still be pronounced eight?

Red_3D#3062: ahhhh, you just closed the circle. I feel enlightened.
ieee 802.11ac#6337: i feel like amogus and loss both fall into the category of "malicious pattern recognition"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: yeah that's the best explanation
Red_3D#3062: so its just *the internet*‚Ñ¢Ô∏è?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (although loss is older)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: like "oh it's amogus"

PseudoGoose#2841: But looking more closely at this app, it's not actually a VPN, except maybe the feature to protect yourself on public wifi. <[newline]> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.mobilesecurity
PseudoGoose#2841: And the "security" capability of VPNs is way too oversold, especially in sponsor segments, it is basically a scam IMO. You're not going to "become anonymous" because you're using a VPN unless you take other measures at the same time
PseudoGoose#2841: anyway, my point was, if the app was a VPN to be used when using mobile data (i.e. the Internet) it's kind of ironic that it is coming from the service provider
Dragon Lord#6944: Oh, I'm sure. But I would rather for someone to look through my activity on the server for a while before finding it as opposed to just reading a single message.
PseudoGoose#2841: I've already got you narrowed down to a pretty small area :)

Saltypretzel#0321: ~~I can't stand programming~~
Dragon Lord#6944: but otherwise i don't mind soft typed languages
Dragon Lord#6944: or matlab
Dragon Lord#6944: can't stand js
Dragon Lord#6944: ^
PLYSHKA#6201: Might be me too, because my journey was like... C-like languages all the way <[newline]> Basic, pascal, c#, Java, c/c++, golang, rust, js/typescript
PLYSHKA#6201: That's why its also slower to compile too, it just checks more
PLYSHKA#6201: Rust is basically the opposite of python <[newline]> It does a lot of compile time checks
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: probably because I'm one of those stinky C++ and assembly people
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i can't stand loose types
PLYSHKA#6201: I didn't do whole lot if python but most notable thing I didn't like is very low type safety and runtime vs compile time checks
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ahh yeah
PLYSHKA#6201: As said before, lots of languages are very different from python. <[newline]> Loose type safety, which can transfer to non-python languages in a not good way <[newline]>  <[newline]> tl.dr - switching from python to pretty much anything else is hard
Verlio_H#0201: after assembly you step up to fortran, then c, then java, then python
Dragon Lord#6944: it's REALLY fast to write software for. It's my go-to when editing text files
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: curious though, what habits?
Dragon Lord#6944: but fr, if you teach good practices first, there's no issue with python
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: once they've learned, they won't want to use python
Dragon Lord#6944: once they've learned, they can have their candy
Verlio_H#0201: spoiling children with python is bad
Dragon Lord#6944: üòé üëç
Verlio_H#0201: to weed out the weaklings
Verlio_H#0201: we should just teach assembly first
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: most of it is reverse-engineering, but knowing a language to quickly write stuff to test your theory is really really useful
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: game modding tools, mostly
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: they are, kinda
PLYSHKA#6201: not game related?
PLYSHKA#6201: ah i see, ongoing project
PLYSHKA#6201: i had issues with rust being too... complex i would say? but cargo alone makes using c/c++ just not worth it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: no way in hell I'm rewriting this stuff in a language I don't know well yet
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (yes, i do actually make good progress on them)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: for my big projects to kinda get finished
PLYSHKA#6201: for what
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: really should... but I'll probably wait a few more years
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: and haven't really given it a good try since
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i tried rust really shortly once
PLYSHKA#6201: also most importantly <[newline]> pretty much pain-free cross platform
PLYSHKA#6201: i started learning rust like 2-3 months ago, what a relief having a good package manager, build system and great balance between syntax sugar and look
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: and it was the most stupid error, still don't know why it was an issue
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: was struggling with one two days ago
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ahaha yeah definitely love those
PLYSHKA#6201: i've used c++ mostly with qt <[newline]> quite easy to do stuff <[newline]> althrough i hate segfaults with absolutely random messages from everywhere
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i like the freedom it gives me, even though it comes back to bite me in the ass most of the time
PLYSHKA#6201: c++ is basically C + java combined
PLYSHKA#6201: it's a bit complex, but friendlier than C
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: smart pointers (which... i rarely use for no real reason)
PLYSHKA#6201: c++ is very friendly honestly
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: classes etc
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: C++ is much easier in that regard with
PLYSHKA#6201: it was a nightmare before i introduced to valgrind that checks memory leaks and points to sources of them
PLYSHKA#6201: constant issues with pointers and memory allocation
PLYSHKA#6201: i couldn't do anything without valgrind with C's MPI
PLYSHKA#6201: and unsafe
PLYSHKA#6201: i find it's very crumblesome
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i did, jokingly
Dragon Lord#6944: asm
PLYSHKA#6201: many people suggest C as best language
PLYSHKA#6201: i didn't say that though
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: clearly c++ is the best language
PLYSHKA#6201: syntax, runtime, everything different
Dragon Lord#6944: but yeah, it's syntactically very different
Dragon Lord#6944: python is c based
PLYSHKA#6201: majority of languages are c-based and python is completely different
Dragon Lord#6944: but yeah
Dragon Lord#6944: not if you start off with c++ üëàüòéüëà
PLYSHKA#6201: that are hard to re-learn when switching
PLYSHKA#6201: it teaches a lot of bad habits
PLYSHKA#6201: i really dislike it
Dragon Lord#6944: i honestly really like python
PLYSHKA#6201: To add up, teacher that "teaches" python learns about it on the go and he only knows about c/c++
Dragon Lord#6944: ours just did C++/C, and now they do python -> C++/C
PLYSHKA#6201: i feel bad for newcomers
PLYSHKA#6201: our university (when i first joined) was going with pascal -> c# -> java route <[newline]> now it's plain python/c++
Dragon Lord#6944: i used it as a programming language
Dragon Lord#6944: yes
PLYSHKA#6201: batch... is kinda not a programming language and more related to OS
Dragon Lord#6944: i started with batch
PLYSHKA#6201: Not python, god no
PLYSHKA#6201: Out of all things, pascal is kinda the best thing you can teach people that barely know anything about programming
Dragon Lord#6944: you think rust is bad? try teaching them matlab
PseudoGoose#2841: You think Python is bad? Try teaching your kids Rust
Verlio_H#0201: python has been shown to lead to increased rate of suicide and mental health problems
Verlio_H#0201: yeah I was gonna say
Red_3D#3062: E? Python almost always leads to serious mental issues and may quite possibly have lasting effects on the development of children /s

PseudoGoose#2841: once you understand the context of the broader problem where IMPLY is helpful (satisfiability :D), then it makes a little more sense
Red_3D#3062: yep, thats exactly what I am experiencing when I look at that image
PseudoGoose#2841: it's also easier to think about if you consider y to be a "requirement" expression and x to be a "condition" expression for when the requirement must be true.  <[newline]> Once upon a time (earlier when I hadn't learned formal logic), I definitely looked at the IMPLY truth table and said "but why?", because all I saw on the table was the boolean values, not the predicates they came from
PseudoGoose#2841: yea
Red_3D#3062: The concept makes sense, but seeing it in a venn diagram is weird
PseudoGoose#2841: pretty common in propositional logic.  <[newline]> x->y means "if x, then y" <[newline]> so if x is true, then y must also be true for the output to be true ("satisfied"). If x is false, then the output is true/satisfied and you don't care about the value of y
Red_3D#3062: huh, this is amazing
MiniStumpy#5653: and it was from the MC wiki xDD

Vynix#3003: The people who built Chernobyl were, they knew about the many flaws but the Soviet Union did nothing. The people who were there that night, they were trying to do a test. They tried this test a few times before, and they were doing this test for years or something. Anyway they made a mistake, and they should've shut down the reactor. But they didn't want to postpone this test again. They tried to fix the problems, but nothing was working. So they tried to hit the "fuck I messed up button" to stop the reactor, but that just made it explode. It exploded because certain conditions were met, this flaw was acknowledged before by the way, so anyway the reactor exploded. Extremely high amounts of radiation were released, and a good amount of people died very painful deaths. If you watch HBO Chernobyl you will see how they died, but don't believe everything in that TV Show. Some of the things were dramatized, otherwise no one would watch it.

ForLoveOfCats#4111: but most of the time a macro is the wrong tool
ForLoveOfCats#4111: This library relies on generating structs with special fields and a bunch of attached logic based on the input, so a macro is pretty much the specific tool for that
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yeah they are a pretty specific tool
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm going to redesign the internals of this library for a third time and when I do that I'm going to move everything into a derive proc macro, until then this monstrosity lives
Lim√≥n#7879: so I never use them
Lim√≥n#7879: most of the time I don't find good use cases for macros
ForLoveOfCats#4111: There are a few syntax additions but once you realize that `macro_rules!` is just input token pattern matching then things click into place
Lim√≥n#7879: (with my little experience)
Lim√≥n#7879: The syntax is so different from the rest of the language
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's honestly a bit of a pain lmao
Lim√≥n#7879: üò±
ForLoveOfCats#4111: One of my libraries has a file with like ~400 lines of just macro :)
Lim√≥n#7879: macros hurt
ForLoveOfCats#4111: For another language which does similar things with string formatting go take a look at Zig (which does all this in userspace using compile time code execution similar to how a proc-macro implementation would work in Rust)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Rust doesn't have varargs, so `println` and friends are implemented as macros instead which have an exclamation mark as part of the invoke syntax. Not having varargs is sometimes an issue but in this specific case it's fine because even if that was supported, these would still be a macro. String formatting macros in Rust are compile time validated in a number of ways and then specialized code is generated for each invocation site. In C/C++ `printf` is also validated at compile time by modern compilers because they "know" printf but then printf still has to parse the format string each call and map the other arguments to the format string with potentially wacky stuff happening if anything is amiss, in addition to the cost of that parsing every time. *Technically* in Rust string format macros (which `println` uses) are implemented in the compiler so them being exposed as macros is more of an indication of how they will behave rather than how they are implemented but they \*could\* be implemented in userspace as proc-macros if someone wanted to.
Lim√≥n#7879: macro funny
Red_3D#3062: but god darn, why is there an exclamation mark in printf
Red_3D#3062: rust is a beautiful language
Lim√≥n#7879: it gives up and tags everything
Lim√≥n#7879: but instead of tagging that
Lim√≥n#7879: it's some weird rust-anaylzer freaking about one problem
Lim√≥n#7879: in this case atleast

Red_3D#3062: kinda the opposite of golfing. Sometimes you try to maximize code, sometimes binary size
CrispyPin#1149: reverse golf?
CrispyPin#1149: what is code bowling
Red_3D#3062: oh god, code bowling is terrible
CrispyPin#1149: why do i feel compelled to make a script that takes a c program and a text and makes the necessary #defines and underscores for the text to be executable
CrispyPin#1149: https://xkcd.com/1960/

CrispyPin#1149: otherwise its too hard to understand the program
CrispyPin#1149: yes
Red_3D#3062: did you have to explain ***every*** token?
CrispyPin#1149: not the comments
Red_3D#3062: ok, I actually hate this a lot
CrispyPin#1149: hold up i want to translate this to swedish
CrispyPin#1149: gcc didnt complain
Red_3D#3062: where are the online docs? <[newline]> readme? <[newline]> multi line comment blocks?

CrispyPin#1149: did i comment it enough?
CrispyPin#1149: i made a c program
Red_3D#3062: well, its probably used to edit "huge" spritemaps
CrispyPin#1149: but i barely know how to use it
CrispyPin#1149: and yea
CrispyPin#1149: its a fork of aseprite
Red_3D#3062: oh my, libresprite is cute af
CrispyPin#1149: UwU's are powerful
Red_3D#3062: crazy how that added 0.14mb
CrispyPin#1149: owo
Red_3D#3062: UwU
CrispyPin#1149: yes
Red_3D#3062: 
CrispyPin#1149: pixelart sized text
CrispyPin#1149: i drew something very small
Red_3D#3062: did you change something about the image itself or the png stuff around it?
CrispyPin#1149: indeed
Red_3D#3062: computers and data are just amazing
CrispyPin#1149: see if you can find what i did <[newline]> or don't, it will take a while
Red_3D#3062: thats also pretty darn good
CrispyPin#1149: also i edited it and saved it and it's only 1.3MB
Red_3D#3062: 200mb with sdl2? I thought there would be more overhead
Red_3D#3062: thats pretty good :O
CrispyPin#1149: oh damn libresprite could open the image too, and only using 198MB of ram
Red_3D#3062: gimp is amazing at compression. I get much better results with it than blender which is why gimp has become part of my post processing pipeline
CrispyPin#1149: but thats neat
CrispyPin#1149: i was not aware you could compress pngs beyond indexing the colours
Red_3D#3062: a lot of compression
CrispyPin#1149: but its several got colours
CrispyPin#1149: which would be 23MB at 1bit per pixel
CrispyPin#1149: theres 187 180 032 pixels
CrispyPin#1149: i thought it was a always bitmap
CrispyPin#1149: how the fuck does png work
Red_3D#3062: its just a flowchart of questions the compiler might ask to figure out initialization
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: what does it look like
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: 16 indexed colors, highest compression
CrispyPin#1149: how is it only 1.1MB
CrispyPin#1149: gimp is the only program i have that can open it and it used 1.3GB for it
Red_3D#3062: each with about 50 edge cases, this describes every single one of them
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: aren't there like 10 different ways
Red_3D#3062: cpp sure is fun
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: w-wha

Dragon Lord#6944: i feel an obligation to protect the ~~idiots~~ inexperienced of the world from microwaving their iphones

Nik#1011: I'm talking about this clip btw (can't find a clean source, but just the intro of this video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjUkQMWqsmI
Dragon Lord#6944: a note to the fbi agent monitoring us (and any non-americans/non-russians in the chat): this is all satire and is horrible gun safety. do not attempt
FacePox#2708: Keep your gun loaded at all times; it‚Äôs more convenient that way
Nik#1011: to test if a gun actually works, you can just point it at your hand to see if anything comes out
Nik#1011: yes yes
Dragon Lord#6944: bugs bunny has never failed me before
FacePox#2708: The inside of the barrel looks really cool you should check it out
Nik#1011: if someone points a gun at you, you can stick your finger in the barrel which will clog the gun and stop it from working
Dragon Lord#6944: but valuable things are the most fun to break... ü•∫
FacePox#2708: Lol
Nik#1011: if you don't want to accidentally shoot anything valuable, keep the gun pointed up in the air
Dragon Lord#6944: if there is a flaw, it should be shot
Verlio_H#0201: no flaws

Dragon Lord#6944: ew, java~~script~~
Nik#1011: what's that even from

Nik#1011: console.write?
Dragon Lord#6944: all my homies use `std::cout << `
Dragon Lord#6944: ew, java
Dragon Lord#6944: they have the `###` kind, but whatever
Nik#1011: system.out.println
Nik#1011: fuckin
Nik#1011: I didn't want to type
Dragon Lord#6944: python doesn't support that kind of comment üòî
Nik#1011: `print("I love you/*r mom haha rekt*/")`
Dragon Lord#6944: ```cpp <[newline]> int x = //this should still work <[newline]> 69; <[newline]> ```
CrispyPin#1149: i think it would work at the start of a line at least
Dragon Lord#6944: i mean, in c/c++ you can break a line in two and put a regular comment in the middle
Verlio_H#0201: like int x = /* your mother */ 69 kinda thing
Dragon Lord#6944: not to my knowlege
Verlio_H#0201: wait is it legal to put a multiline comment in the middle of something
Dragon Lord#6944: tabulate is
CrispyPin#1149: 13 is a great indent length
Nik#1011: god my brain must be deactivated today. I thought tabulator was an 8 letter word
Nik#1011: nvm
Nik#1011: wait

DustyAngel47#7299: Javascript arrow functions
Nik#1011: oh
Dragon Lord#6944: ...
Nik#1011: ikr it's gotta be at least a prime number
Dragon Lord#6944: 2 and 4 at least get the spacing right...
Nik#1011: ok this joke has immediately gone past the point where my understanding of programming ends
Dragon Lord#6944: who uses 11 character tabs tho?
DustyAngel47#7299: what about `(()=>{})();`
Nik#1011: ok what about ({;})
Dragon Lord#6944: i mean... it *is* skipped when being interpreted in c/c++
Nik#1011: I just assumed it would work
Nik#1011: idk
CrispyPin#1149: in what language
Nik#1011: using `({})` as my indentation
Nik#1011: I have a better idea

DanielGJ44#4557: I was kinda joking. I use both equally, dual booting as well.

Dragon Lord#6944: Oh shit, didn't read the previous messages... Sorry dude...
DanielGJ44#4557: It takes a lot of conscious work but that has sincerely really helped me, and it has almost taken away any worry of something bad happening because I'm already at peace with it before it happens
DanielGJ44#4557: For example, "why bother, it's going to end/die/be worthless anyways" could be turned into "it's going to end/die/be worthless in the future, I should make the most and appreciate these things while I still can"
DanielGJ44#4557: I think Nik is probably right, but I know I used to/still do have thoughts like that and I've learned to turn them into positives, if that makes sense
Red_3D#3062: I have enough self control to identify and dismiss suicidal thoughts but maybe I should think of a better strategy

Nik#1011: sorry to hear you're feeling down. <3
Nik#1011: idk
Nik#1011: that sounds like... a good way to accidentally suicide yourself when you're actually in a recoverable mood
Red_3D#3062: hmm I never thought about it that way but from my experience its easiest and quickest to return to good feelings if I burn myself down completely and reevaluate everything that went wrong.
Nik#1011: I don't recommend holding in your emotions tho, and still talk about what's taking over your mind. I'm just saying a lot of people out there could benefit from practicing not focusing on those types of thoughts. can make it a bit easier long-term to handle your thoughts
Nik#1011: and that's just because negative thoughts do exist, they do bring themselves to the front of your mind a lot of the time, but saying them outloud is only going to kind of promote that behavior in your head
Nik#1011: idk if this was a joke or not but honestly I don't personally believe people should say things like this almost ever

ieee 802.11ac#6337: you mean deprecated right? depreciated means something has lost value (i.e. "venezuela's currency has depreciated very rapidly")
DustyAngel47#7299: its depreciated to the highest degree
DustyAngel47#7299: i gotta be the first person to use it today though
PseudoGoose#2841: liteloader was ~1.12, rift was ~1.13, fabric is 1.14+
PseudoGoose#2841: and maybe a couple others
PseudoGoose#2841: yea before there was fabric there was liteloader for a bit
DustyAngel47#7299: TI-re-L
DustyAngel47#7299: which apparently had a 1.12.2 version for liteloader at some point
DustyAngel47#7299: apparently i had liteloader for minihud
DustyAngel47#7299: ah the good ol days
DustyAngel47#7299: why tho ü§î
DustyAngel47#7299: lmao, i just noticed that my mc1.12.2 instance has fucking liteloader installed
Verlio_H#0201: they using like the combatability opengl version
Verlio_H#0201: yeah probably
Broyojo#2667: for optimizations
Broyojo#2667: because maybe sodium uses newer opengl api stuff
Broyojo#2667: not that much performance increase
Broyojo#2667: I experienced this too
Broyojo#2667: I think because macos still using opengl 2 for minecraft maybe
ieee 802.11ac#6337: opencomputers isn't even on 1.16 forge lmao
DustyAngel47#7299: also opencomputers2 lol https://github.com/fnuecke/oc2
Verlio_H#0201: idk
DustyAngel47#7299: wtf how
Verlio_H#0201: in my experience sodium does like almost nothing to fps and optifine significantly improves it, phosphorus and the other one is good though
DustyAngel47#7299: yeah we have cc:r but oc won the race a long time ago
Broyojo#2667: hmm yes
Broyojo#2667: and also sodium, starlight, lithium
DustyAngel47#7299: i think the only thing really missing is opencomputers
Broyojo#2667: or carpet mod
Broyojo#2667: like ones from masa
Broyojo#2667: I use a lot of technical mods
Broyojo#2667: yes fabric good
DustyAngel47#7299: all the stuff you need and no minute-long forge loading times
DustyAngel47#7299: this is my mod list
PseudoGoose#2841: for (older) content mods maybe, but fabric is great for QoL in vanilla. The scicraft stuff like Litematica, Carpet, Tweakeroo, Minihud, and also the CaffeineMC optimization mods like Sodium (instead of Optifine). And all of those are open-source
DustyAngel47#7299: although not sure if the original has been ported (or if it even can be ported, idk if the code was ever ossed)
DustyAngel47#7299: <https://github.com/devs-immortal/The-Aether>
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Op
DustyAngel47#7299: yes
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Is there a fabric ather mod?
DustyAngel47#7299: also open-source
DustyAngel47#7299: all the mods i use have better fabric alternatives at this point ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
DustyAngel47#7299: but but sodium
ieee 802.11ac#6337: tbh i just prefer forge because of the mod selection
DustyAngel47#7299: ^
PseudoGoose#2841: forge stans
PseudoGoose#2841: yes that is the joke
DustyAngel47#7299: STOP POSTING ABOUT FABRIC, I'M TIRED OF SEEING IT! My friends on Forge discord send me Fabric mods, on liteloader it's fucking Fabric. I was in... a server, right?.. And AAAALL of the channels were just Fabric stuff! I showed my minecraft world to my girlfriend, and I changed Forge+Optifine to Fabric+Sodium and said "Hey babe, when the game runs on an arduino". I looked at my Forge MMC instance. And I thought of Fabric and I go like "FORGE... MORE LIKE FABRIC!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!"

Verlio_H#0201: basically I was trying to say (in my very fucked up sentence) that any 30 year old system that is used would be much more likely to run semi modern linux than windows 10
Red_3D#3062: I am a little confused
Verlio_H#0201: I just realized that sentence makes 0 sense
Verlio_H#0201: well see red which one is more likely to be able to run the kernel which is supporting the features
Red_3D#3062: anyway, have a nice time everyone and happy computing. ima go into sleep mode
Red_3D#3062: yee, you really have to spend a lot of time to understand and be able to get the most out of a modern linux system and even then its impossible to be aware of everything.
Nik#1011: (but still irritating)
Nik#1011: Linux doesn't have the same kind of management tho, it's more understandable I guess
DustyAngel47#7299: 
Nik#1011: lol. true in some ways
Red_3D#3062: everyone hating on windows for backward compatibility and then its them Linux people insisting on supporting 30 year old systems that no one uses anymore
Nik#1011: same. I know how to go into insert mode and how to close it. that's all
DustyAngel47#7299: like i literally have micro installed on tv
Nik#1011: I go hide
DustyAngel47#7299: i know vi(m) enough to use it as a bootstrap to install literally any other text editor, but thats it
Nik#1011: this is <#403343343775383552>
Nik#1011: I'm angy
Nik#1011: sorry
Nik#1011: which is FINE if they weren't set as defaults
Nik#1011: like vim and less and nano are all 3 so unique from anything I'm used to
Nik#1011: well I don't think it's a bad system but it is not a standard by any definition I'm familiar with. and I've only ever worked in the IT industry
Verlio_H#0201: hm yes q such a wierd letter to pick for the quit function
Nik#1011: yesss
Nik#1011: micro is fantastic btw,
DustyAngel47#7299: micro üòé
Nik#1011: I mean nano is weird as shit too but not as bad. and at least it has some hint of how to close it printed at the bottom
Red_3D#3062: well, its designed for the terminal. I think its not a bad default but modern distros could change it up
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~i mean q is the first letter of quit~~
Nik#1011: I guess
Nik#1011: mind boggling
Nik#1011: and the fact that so many Linux things use these as defaults is...
Red_3D#3062: there are probably some gui editors that would work as well
Nik#1011: vim has its strengths I understand, but it also defies all modern expectations and I'm expecting a similar experience
Nik#1011: less being closed exclusively with 'q' literally caused me an HOUR of pain
Nik#1011: there are standards and expectations for UI these days
Red_3D#3062: but I think you could use any program that you can pipe stuff into
Red_3D#3062: well, `bat` has some simple formatting but I think it also uses less or something similar under the hood
Nik#1011: what pager options exist?
Nik#1011: but I also am extremely unfamiliar and uncomfortable with vim controls
Nik#1011: ahh ty. yes. less is really what annoyes me
The Great Vulpan#4980: interesting rule
FacePox#2708: One weird example is a server I'm in where the only rule is that you can't post anything which violates U.S. law, but it's a really unique situation because the core members, me included, have known each-other for years and are pretty good friends. So you get weirdo racists who join but because the community is so tight knit, everyone just mocks them until they leave
The Great Vulpan#4980: "Everyone hates power until you offer them some" - Arthur Edwards  195X - 2021
The Great Vulpan#4980: ah well what can you do.
The Great Vulpan#4980: We had a #.memes chat that was unmoderated with the exception of no extreme nsfw content but the "extremeness" got too extreme. I mean extreme with a capital X and a banging 90's soundtrack. And well, we tried to stop it but it created backlash, we backed off and it got even worse.
FacePox#2708: So for instance in the dwarf fortress server there was #elfposting, which was opt in and almost entirely unmoderated. Very crude and rude place. Eventually though it got too bad and the rest of the server didn't want to be associated with elfposters, so #elfposting was deleted and replaced with #dwarfposting, which is still a no topic channel for memes and flamewars, but it's as moderated as the rest of the server. Personally, I didn't want to to go that far and I thought #elfposting could still be salvaged, but apparently the mods thought different.
The Great Vulpan#4980: We tried stepping back but that just made the mod team appear weak and the shitposting actually became 10x worse. We talking racism, nationalism and nudity. <[newline]> The mods finally regained control tonight. 14 bans occured. xD
DustyAngel47#7299: or was it too late
DustyAngel47#7299: Did you try backpedaling
The Great Vulpan#4980: Funnily enough it wasnt moderated too much. but then we started moderating it more and it created a rift.
FacePox#2708: not unmoderated
FacePox#2708: less moderated
DustyAngel47#7299: But you still moderate there
Jimmy#8080: <#428658408510455810>
FacePox#2708: but it can be dangerous if it's too little moderated
FacePox#2708: that's an idea I like
FacePox#2708: A lot of servers have a less moderated opt in shitposting channel or a few channels
DustyAngel47#7299: Loyalists vs Bobbists
DustyAngel47#7299: I'm starting the LW Civil War
Jimmy#8080: Excuse the very serious approach to a pretty casual message haha. Online communities are something I think about a lot, and I'm eager to study exceptional cases of them
Jimmy#8080: How did it come to this? What steps should the mods have taken a long time ago to prevent this crazy conflict? How can communities like ours learn from what happened?
The Great Vulpan#4980: On one side the mods and casual members, on the other we have the shitposters and the tryhards. It is both funny and tragic.
The Great Vulpan#4980: I don't know if you knew but i am a mod on an eu4 discord server and well a irl civil war has erupted tonight

Red_3D#3062: man pages are awesome :D <[newline]> I also didnt know about this until earlier today when I saw a reddit poll about pagers.
Stenodyon#8192: I had no idea this was possible, I could have known if I had read the man man pages
Stenodyon#8192: aaaah thanks
Red_3D#3062: -c 'set ft=man ts=8 nomod noma lz [...]'
Stenodyon#8192: hmmmmm
Red_3D#3062: man pages look crappy because less is the default pager. I am currently using neovim. Its much nicer to look at and easier to navigate
Verlio_H#0201: I think terminal is fine
Nik#1011: I'd prefer the browser
Nik#1011: I dunnoooo
Nik#1011: the interface mostly
Nik#1011: so like I've always found man pages to be annoying as hell to read through on the terminal
Red_3D#3062: ah, alright
PseudoGoose#2841: i meant select for copy/paste
PseudoGoose#2841: oh ok, same
Red_3D#3062: well, I select with the mouse but always use shift + ctrl + c/v
PseudoGoose#2841: there's probably some kind of vim select mode in some emulators but I don't bother with that
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah?
Red_3D#3062: you copy/paste with the mouse?
PseudoGoose#2841: besides copy/paste
PseudoGoose#2841: i almost never use mouse in terminal regardless
Red_3D#3062: most modern terminals and pager combinations work pretty well with the mouse
PseudoGoose#2841: <:thenking:446109302369812490>
PseudoGoose#2841: oh wait, do modern pagers have mouse integration? i know terminal emulators have mouse input extensions
PseudoGoose#2841: _scroll scroll scroll scroll_
PseudoGoose#2841: b-b-but my _mouse_
Red_3D#3062: ~~just use a modern shell & pager /s~~
PseudoGoose#2841: but also, it's cool that they're being converted/presented in a "modern" format
PseudoGoose#2841: sometimes, i feel like manpages showing up in search results are just there to mock you and say "it's in here dumbass" when you're trying to search for a specific usage
PseudoGoose#2841: in most cases when I need a manpage, I'm already on a linux shell
PseudoGoose#2841: true
Red_3D#3062: oh, sorry for that. Just wanted to joke around with "smh, you already have a local copy and still go the browser route" but totally see how it could be useful and use the web for man pages every now and then myself.
PseudoGoose#2841: i feel like it kinda means /s but also kinda truth but you want to soften the blow . maybe like adding "haha" onto the end of a message haha
PseudoGoose#2841: ~~oh i didn't notice the strikeout~~
PseudoGoose#2841: i wouldn't really call it "bloat", sure the database might be a little big but it really has no effect on the core functionality of the site, and it can be pretty convenient even if you only know a few. I use `!g !w !az` all pretty often

ieee 802.11ac#6337: it depends on the game for me, in rpgs i'm definitely the "being mean is not nice :(" sort of player but in gta-esque games i am definitely commiting digital felonies with usually little moral care
Stenodyon#8192: Very interesting; I can't help not being myself in video games, no matter what the character's personality is. Even when the character is supposed to be rude I can't bring myself to be rude to other characters (unless they've been a dick to me, in that case I pick the rudest option)
Jimmy#8080: Interesting. For me they're strongly correlated. I get really into character when I play a game, and whatever characterization I channel, it influences both my actions and words.

Red_3D#3062: well, we can stop. It happened and I dont really care
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: But even being as mildly tempered as I am, I'd probably be kicking some ass if I was him
Red_3D#3062: can we be sure of that?  But I would disagree with you regardless of that
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I don't mean to make a whole discussion over a meme
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: He knew what he was doing
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: That dude's ass deserves to be kicked
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: The question is is it wrong to knowingly cheat on someone
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I mean
Red_3D#3062: exposing her cheating is one thing, possibly physically harming someone because of it is another.
Red_3D#3062: wait, the dude she was cheating with being caught is a good thing?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: And if she was cheating the relationship was basically over anyways
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I think it's more fine because the dude was actually physically caught
Red_3D#3062: maybe I am just not in the mood for funny rn, in which case I'll just let you have fun
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: It's funny tho
Red_3D#3062: as I said it is a tense situation and I probably would not have been able to stay calm. Still, a lot of stuff could have gone better here
Red_3D#3062: I think I should expand my it to everyone. putting the video online wasnt nice, this going on in the first place is kinda weird and he could have handled the situation better
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: especially when you know you‚Äôre being lied to

ForLoveOfCats#4111: I knew that Illuminos was a community project
ForLoveOfCats#4111: opensolaris was the official source release project, now discontinued as the OS has turned proprietary in 2018
ForLoveOfCats#4111: hmmm no
ForLoveOfCats#4111: those are all community projects though, which I assumed were taking over after the official discontinuation
Verlio_H#0201: illuminos is still being continued though iirc
Verlio_H#0201: opensolaris is though
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Oh wait Solaris actually isn't discontinued
Verlio_H#0201: so it looks like posix is like branched from sus
Verlio_H#0201: was it on purpose or did they do something haram?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: but it seems like this happened before that?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: well Solaris itself is discontinued of course lol
Verlio_H#0201: yeah that is very interesting actually
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Interesting, Solaris used to be certified but isn't anymore
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I would very very very hesitate to call MacOS anything near a BSD flavor
Verlio_H#0201: yeah cause certification is pain I'd assume
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It looks like there are no BSD flavors which are certified as unix compliant
Verlio_H#0201: and is based on BSD which is definentaly unix
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yeah I just saw that
Verlio_H#0201: because macOS is registered as unix compliant
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I think some BSDs are Unix spec compliant?
Verlio_H#0201: well what exactly counts as a unix here? just Unix itself?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: MacOS is posix certified, but is not a Unix, Linux is mostly posix compliant but is not a Unix, Windows has a bunch of posix coverage (with some really frustrating holes) and is really not a Unix
ForLoveOfCats#4111: My understanding (which wikipedia seems to be agreeing with) is that POSIX != Unix but instead is \*based\* on Unix (ignoring the fact that the name Unix in itself is a single product which doesn't even exist anymore)
Verlio_H#0201: also what is the difference between sus and posix I never really understood that

The Great Vulpan#4980: My favourite is 1+2+3+4+5+..... = Sigma(x) x=1 -> INF = -1/12
MiniStumpy#5653: yeah
The Great Vulpan#4980: so i find that. Sigma(n) n=1 -> INF is sufficient
The Great Vulpan#4980: its just hard to verbally describe this
MiniStumpy#5653: yeah I didn't read the last part me big dumb dumb
The Great Vulpan#4980: 
MiniStumpy#5653: xD
MiniStumpy#5653: which will add up to 1
MiniStumpy#5653: ohhhhhhh
The Great Vulpan#4980: For example. (Sigma((1/2)^x) x=1 -> INF   ) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ........ = 1
MiniStumpy#5653: btw I will go to high school in max 7 days
MiniStumpy#5653: xD
MiniStumpy#5653: ICH LERNE JA JA JA!!!
MiniStumpy#5653: so Sigma(x) x=1 -> 5 = 15
The Great Vulpan#4980: yeah. if it was x=1 -> INF then it would be an infinite series of sums.
MiniStumpy#5653: and it all sums up
The Great Vulpan#4980: Its hard to write out the equation without using the symbols but it just means that x starts at 1 and then increments to 5.#
MiniStumpy#5653: what's that arrow for
MiniStumpy#5653: wat
The Great Vulpan#4980: So 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 =  Sigma(x) x=1 -> 5
MiniStumpy#5653: thanks
MiniStumpy#5653: ok
MiniStumpy#5653: sigma
MiniStumpy#5653: oh yeeeah

doodocina#5040: windows supports swap file too
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Fascinating stuff
ForLoveOfCats#4111: There was also that MS-DOS/Windows 9x software that did in-memory ram compression
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yall joked about compressing a swapfile but that is something that the Linux kernel \*actually\* supports. Zram is compressed swap in memory and Zswap is compressed swap in memory which can still page to disk, I've used Zswap with some good results when running really memory heavy applications (UE4 editor) with hardware that simply didn't meet the memory requirements.

Dragon Lord#6944: <\rant>
Dragon Lord#6944: At this point just the user interface is almost 3,000 lines of code, and the back end is horribly unoptimized. I I'm just hacking stuff together at this point, but I suppose that's what software engineering is all about.

CrispyPin#1149: 
DustyAngel47#7299: s\/parts/points
Dragon Lord#6944: That would have saved memory and headache, but no.
Dragon Lord#6944: Pts is short for points. There are approximately 200 points per image, and 36 images in the main set that I am running tests with. It's not really that many points. Each one of those variables is just a different step in the filtering process. He could just as well have written back to the original variable because he never goes back and uses the other ones at any point except filtering.
DustyAngel47#7299: that must be a lot of parts
Dragon Lord#6944: We are programming in matlab. It is something to do with one of the graphical processing libraries that we are using. Evidently the sample code on the documentation uses 'cc' as its variable, and he just copy pasted. I've also come across such gems as 'GoodPts', 'NewPts', 'NewPts2', 'NewPts3', 'NewGoodPts', etc. All within the same function.
Infini#5724: that too
Verlio_H#0201: closed captioning
Infini#5724: or cc watermark
DustyAngel47#7299: like carbon copy
DustyAngel47#7299: or is it something dumb
DustyAngel47#7299: > cc <[newline]> is that the c compiler variable?
Dragon Lord#6944: The guy that wrote the back end of the code that I am implementing for work is a civil engineer with no formal programming training. The pain of trying to trace what a variable called 'cc' or 'XxYyZz' is is is a worse pain than the time I stepped on that rusty screw.

Reese4221#8317: lemme grab my DS real quick
Reese4221#8317: pretty sure that thing also only works locally

Reese4221#8317: and assuming its the same frog
Reese4221#8317: if i remember correctly
Reese4221#8317: flipnote studio
Infini#5724: isnt that the frog from nintendo ds web connect or something
Reese4221#8317: i had issues with full screen but sorted it out however i dont have many (if any) games with launchers
Reese4221#8317: huh
FacePox#2708: Mostly games would be wonky. I messed around in the config for a long time and got fullscreen to properly work, but game launchers would still act weird all the time.
yot#3606: well not really since the golden disks actually contain pictures and music but if the aliens couldn't figure out how to get that said media then the 2 assistants could actually give them more info
yot#3606: honestly both assistants could possibly offer more info about us than voyeger's golden disks... <[newline]> I mean aliens could know kinda how we sounded like, how technologically advanced we got (compared to the voyegers at least...) <[newline]> they could know that at least 2 companies existed on earth, which is 2 pieces on info vs the 1 piece of info that earth has a space agency named "NASA"
Red_3D#3062: lol
yot#3606: yeah lol <[newline]> ... <[newline]> uh oh Veyeger 1 and 2! <[newline]> there's a new contender is in town! <[newline]> and it's Cortona and Alexa, conversing with one another in an infinite loop!
Red_3D#3062: I think the only way it could be the only surviving thing is if we send it out into space or something
yot#3606: only like 0.0000000000000000000000001% :P
yot#3606: I mean the probability isn't a flat 0%
Red_3D#3062: I doubt a complex electrical machine would survive longer than ruins of a city / some rock formation
yot#3606: and after a millenium is the only proof that humanity existed
yot#3606: one that never ends
yot#3606: actually I wonder if there's a way you could make voice assistants create a looping conversation
doodocina#5040: https://tenor.com/view/disappointed-face-palm-seriously-exasperated-gif-7304550
yot#3606: or at least they're close enough
yot#3606: add microsoft's and minecraft's text to speech accessibility feature too <[newline]> they probably also count as assistants
doodocina#5040: https://youtu.be/h5l3tAHQrQc
Red_3D#3062: add stt -> gpt -> tts while you're at it
doodocina#5040: assistant hell
yot#3606: why not
yot#3606: sure
doodocina#5040: and siri and yandex why not
yot#3606: see which one lasts the longest
yot#3606: just add google's and samsung's assistants to the mix <[newline]> make it extra chaotic
doodocina#5040: alexa sucks a lot
doodocina#5040: i just watched and assistant battle lol))
doodocina#5040: hey alexa write a AAA game pls
yot#3606: ~~that moment when you don't know to which company you want to give your data so you just pick both~~
yot#3606: you wouldn't <[newline]> but if you want one for some reason <[newline]> then 2 would be extra stupid
Red_3D#3062: why would you want a voice assistant (except if you cant operate your device otherwise ofc)
yot#3606: so why on earth would you want 2 voice assistants
yot#3606: you already have microsoft's useless voice assistant
yot#3606: still though <[newline]> like why would you want an alexa in your laptop
yot#3606: that's really not my taste :P

yot#3606: yeah it's an extreme example but people still considered it as indie
Infini#5724: yea thats true
Infini#5724: ah
DustyAngel47#7299: idk if i would call mojang a "small group" even pre-microsoft
yot#3606: games made by a small group or 1 - 2 people <[newline]> games like binding of isaac, meat boy, minecraft before Microsoft bought mojang etc...
Nik#1011: I dunno. I guess I expected it to be shit lmao
Nik#1011: of course there's some issues with proton. games crash a lot more too. but I have been really surprised how perfect it can be for some games, I'm impressed
Infini#5724: what are indie games
yot#3606: it's pretty reliable on my 50+ game library <[newline]> (most are indie though)
Infini#5724: thats not every program doe
Infini#5724: yes ive heard
yot#3606: steam has proton though
Infini#5724: not needing to fiddle around with code to get games to support linux
yot#3606: when linux comes without the locks
yot#3606: if you do that then at that point why even use windows though
Infini#5724: i imagine if you can remove watermark you can also remove locks on some features
yot#3606: so I wouldn't do it <[newline]> or at least do it in a virtual machine
yot#3606: idk if it breaks something if you do it though
Infini#5724: ik ik
yot#3606: not *officially*
Infini#5724: you can remove watermark without paying?
yot#3606: so good job micro$oft
Infini#5724: wait what
yot#3606: you can play with the registry to remove the watermark üòÜ
Infini#5724: train station üëé
Infini#5724: so
Infini#5724: linux doesn trequire you to spend money to remove watermark and can generally be more stable then binbows
yot#3606: something similar happened at a train station for me once
DustyAngel47#7299: hopefully they decide to use arch btw
DustyAngel47#7299: ^^^
Nik#1011: agree
Infini#5724: should have used linux
Nik#1011: pretty legit
Nik#1011: at the train station
Nik#1011: I also saw this today
Infini#5724: omg
Infini#5724: THE CREATOR IS ASIAN
Nik#1011: well this is the meme I was referencing. no it's not super bad but it's still poking fun at a specific culture with the spelling and everything too and it's not great
Infini#5724: still memes = joke <[newline]>  <[newline]> unless it actually is quite ooffensive
yot#3606: nah at least you do your job
Infini#5724: ok then
Nik#1011: I'm just catching up on chats. if there's a problem with what was said, I feel the need to mention it. it was a bit unnecessary this time tho ye
Infini#5724: indeed
yot#3606: yeah I think you're a bit late üòÜ
Infini#5724: the fact the convo about that was already over
Nik#1011: yee..
Infini#5724: unless its.. actually bad
Infini#5724: memes also = jokes
Infini#5724: omg ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nik#1011: heads up I feel you're getting a little unnecessarily aggressive again. nothing of big concern today but try to keep it chill. also any memes making fun of specific cultures isn't really welcome either.
yot#3606: wow that's sad
Infini#5724: is image was actually not edited, an actual PC does have these specs

Infini#5724: and the fact that lungs arent made of cotton?
Dragon Lord#6944: Yes, but smoke comes out of the outlet tube in the jar as well. The point is not how often you are breathing in and out, it's how much the stuff in the smoke sticks to things that are porous like the lungs.
doodocina#5040: i ned it
doodocina#5040: send funniest meme pls
Infini#5724: you cant rapidly suck
Infini#5724: thing is you blow smoke out your lungs
Dragon Lord#6944: It has an air outlet. The point is that the stuff that comes into the jar gets stuck and can't go out the air hole just like in the lungs
Infini#5724: no
Dragon Lord#6944: Do you think the jar is constantly filling with air?
Infini#5724: you breath out though

yot#3606: they are actually the complete difference
Infini#5724: ok
yot#3606: well then the people in the meme are not an example of that
Infini#5724: but some dumb people still end up living
Infini#5724: yea i guess
yot#3606: well then you know what "survived of the fittest" means?
Infini#5724: yea

Verlio_H#0201: maybe its an @ for some social media
Red_3D#3062: and now I have been questioned by someone who presumably also is pretty interested in it
Red_3D#3062: so I spend some effort figuring it out
Red_3D#3062: I really wanted to know if they had a different contact method for teenagers
Infini#5724: yall why are you staring at a slight difference in text
Red_3D#3062: here is your image but I aligned the sections
Infini#5724: one is sex number one is number for reporting stuff
Verlio_H#0201: sus
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: one sec
Red_3D#3062: the right side is for checking how accurate my extraction is
PseudoGoose#2841: or even because the font is smaller
PseudoGoose#2841: The main difference is the offset, but if you think about it, move the "HMU" to the other side of the blacked out text, they would be close to aligning
Verlio_H#0201: maybe it doesn't have like +1 on it or something
PseudoGoose#2841: It is noticeably shorter by a little bit, but these definitely could be the same phone number.
PseudoGoose#2841: I disagree.
Broyojo#2667: hopefully in the next few years we can get that sort of performance
Broyojo#2667: yeah 9800 really haven't been beaten yet
Broyojo#2667: voodo only made up to 6000
Broyojo#2667: oh amd also made some radeon 9800 cards like 18 years ago
Verlio_H#0201: in 3 generations we will have RX 10900 XT though so
Broyojo#2667: i actually have a 9800 GT
Verlio_H#0201: my mom has a 8600 GT in her computer so she is basically a gamer
Saltypretzel#0321: therefore the 9800 GT is the best graphics card
Red_3D#3062: I strongly agree with this graph

Zephi#4594: if anyone reads it based on my recommendation thank you
Zephi#4594: https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/
Zephi#4594: but there exists an archive of homestuck which preserves them
Zephi#4594: these are now dead
Zephi#4594: originally homestuck had flash pages
Zephi#4594: and if you can spare like 3.9 gb or w/e
Zephi#4594: i recommend for everyone to read it if they can spare the time
Zephi#4594: but yeah
Zephi#4594: i don't know why i waited so long to reread it
Zephi#4594: because i see more of the references that i didn't before
Zephi#4594: and now that i actually have a functioning brain i'm enjoying rereading it even more
Zephi#4594: i really enjoyed homestuck 5 years ago when i first read it
Zephi#4594: i feel as if those things help show the greatness of the happy parts of it
Zephi#4594: would a story with no deaths or sadness be very fun
Zephi#4594: i ask a question that has probably been asked in the past
VigilanteHobo#1873: crabputing
Zephi#4594: anyway
Zephi#4594: is that a homestuck reference

VigilanteHobo#1873: no im just spoiling it cause you gave me the idea
Zephi#4594: characters die in basically any story
Zephi#4594: that's your only complaint?
VigilanteHobo#1873: everyone dies
VigilanteHobo#1873: WHY DIDNT I THINK OF THAT
Zephi#4594: then why don't you just ruin everyone's enjoyment of the comic, and spoil things, just so you can say what specifically you consider filler or what you don't like about it?
Reese4221#8317: but what does the admeme have to say?
Zephi#4594: if you really don't like homestuck and you sincerely think nobody should read it

Dragon Lord#6944: ||it occurs to me that that phrase may not be terribly intuitive for people that aren't from the US. I don't know how popular the story is, but there was essentially a cult that had ritualistic suicide by drinking Kool-Aid as the main thing that people remembered. Because of this, the phrase 'drank the Kool-Aid' has come to mean something similar to 'fallen for an obvious trick in the most complete sense'.||

Stenodyon#8192: yup, finding the link (I thought I had it saved)
Dragon Lord#6944: UBI might help, but it's still far from a full solution and needs more research.
Dragon Lord#6944: Is that so? Interesting... Do you have one on hand? I am genuinely interested :)
Stenodyon#8192: I know it's a common argument that sounds plausible, but there is evidence to the contrary
Stenodyon#8192: raising the minimum wage doesn't cause a significant amount of inflation
Dragon Lord#6944: in the end, it comes down to human selfishness on the part of the businesses.
Dragon Lord#6944: Ah, I see your point. I still wouldn't call it theft, but I do agree that it's not an ethical business practice. I'm not sure how we can get around the issue of having a fair salary when raising minimum wage leads to severe inflation, and the wages of every profession that was above the new minimum lags behind the cost of living increase. A complex issue to be sure, and I'm by no means a politician.
Stenodyon#8192: since the employee has been forced into the deal
Stenodyon#8192: and I strongly disagree that it isn't theft if the agreement has been reached out of "desperation"
Stenodyon#8192: in the current situation you are *required* to have a job to survive
Stenodyon#8192: it's not a choice
Dragon Lord#6944: but I wouldn't call it theft since both parties agreed to the trade, even if one was out of desparation.
Dragon Lord#6944: granted, there are a LOT of predatory practices with wage dealings...
Dragon Lord#6944: if they agreed to that salary, that's not theft; that's just a good deal from one party's perspective and a bad deal from the other's.
Stenodyon#8192: I don't know how I can make the second point clearer? if you pay your employees less than what their work is worth you are stealing money from them
Stenodyon#8192: the three points mentioned in the meme are things big companies want and lobby for so it does not make sense that they would call themselves out in the 4th point, that is why this meme doesn't make sense
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I find it hard to find how you draw either of those conclusions
CrispyPin#1149: Good points
MiniStumpy#5653: My brain is trying to comprehend what you've just said because I am too young for it lmao
Stenodyon#8192: also, if you can't afford to pay a decent wage to your employees you don't deserve the employees

Dragon Lord#6944: Please show me a vertical desk. (Easels don't count, they're much less common)
VigilanteHobo#1873: Logic world discord figures out why there is Y-Up and Z-Up
Dragon Lord#6944: As much as I like minecraft, I do prefer right handed with z up. That way, if you do a top view it looks like your standard axes, and the added dimension is a more natural direction.
Verlio_H#0201: well what if you hold the paper out in front of you
FacePox#2708: and because z = f(x,y) is ingrained in my brain

DanielGJ44#4557: and it's not like any other liquid here doesn't come in jugs or containers anyways
DanielGJ44#4557: I believe the thought there would be reusable containers - plastic jugs/bottles can release toxins into whatever its contents are over time. I'd prefer to use a reuseable glass or stainless steel container, which are regularly available, instead

DanielGJ44#4557: win-win
DanielGJ44#4557: it keeps costs lower for the consumer and manufacturer
DanielGJ44#4557: I can't really think of a single way the bag is inferior to a carton or jug aside from being able to take it with you, at which point you probably have a sizeable enough refrigerator or decant it into a reuseable container anyways
Verlio_H#0201: just put more milk in it

DanielGJ44#4557: In my experience with jugs, cartons, and bags, I would take the bags any day

Zephi#4594: amd fx 4300
Red_3D#3062: wait whats your cpu
Zephi#4594: and averaging it now
Zephi#4594: i'm running it 64 times on one thread
Red_3D#3062: well, your time for the sieve is 8.7k mine is 9k
Zephi#4594: "finished array of numbers = done"
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I know it'll be slower, I'm curious by what factor
Zephi#4594: rather than
Zephi#4594: because it technically does contain the prime numbers
Red_3D#3062: a single calloc call should be very well optimized
Zephi#4594: i am just saying "finished sieve = done"
Zephi#4594: this is probably where it is UNFAIR
Red_3D#3062: but you have to so many more operations per math thing
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm just curious
Zephi#4594: wait question red
ForLoveOfCats#4111: 1/8th the work
ForLoveOfCats#4111: so in this case the initialization is also cheaper
ForLoveOfCats#4111: but you also have to fill it initially
ForLoveOfCats#4111: yeah if the allocation is indeed cheap
Red_3D#3062: probably only makes it slower
ForLoveOfCats#4111: pack 8 entries to a byte with bit shifting and see how it affects the overall program speed
Red_3D#3062: yep, sounds about right
ForLoveOfCats#4111: 1:4
ForLoveOfCats#4111: that explains the ratio of inaccuracy
ForLoveOfCats#4111: oooooooh
Red_3D#3062: the array is of type bool = 1 byte
Red_3D#3062: ah
ForLoveOfCats#4111: very odd
ForLoveOfCats#4111: huh
Red_3D#3062: no clue lol
Red_3D#3062: htop saying something else
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So where is my understanding breaking down?
Red_3D#3062: only about 1 gig
ForLoveOfCats#4111: > but that should be pretty fast (only one calloc call) <[newline]> <:thonking:432741465844875264>
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So just checking my understanding of the algorithm for i32/u32 that's 4 bytes * 1_000_000_000 entries = 4_000_000_000 bytes,  4_000_000_000 bytes / 1024 = 3_906_250 KiB, 3_906_250 KiB / 1024 = ~3_814.7 MiB, ~3_814.7 MiB / 1024 = *~3.7 GiB* of allocation
Zephi#4594: ok nvm switching to u32 did nothing for the speed lol
Red_3D#3062: still 9000ms
Zephi#4594: i'm a god damned liar
Zephi#4594: wait no i'm not
Zephi#4594: i'm using u32
Red_3D#3062: lets switch to u32
Red_3D#3062: OH
ForLoveOfCats#4111: What size of integer are you using in your implementation Red?
Zephi#4594: just the algo is 8788ms after rewriting
Red_3D#3062: just one array of the size of your limit
ForLoveOfCats#4111: As I'm not a very mathy person my knowledge of sieve of Atkin is made up entirely of reading wikipedia just now so my understanding is breaking down a bit. You have to allocate an array for each number that is in the range you are checking?
Red_3D#3062: but that should be pretty fast (only one calloc call)
Zephi#4594: kk i'll remake my program (i deleted it) and yeah
Red_3D#3062: yes
Zephi#4594: does the algorithm include the time of memory allocation
Red_3D#3062: I get the time before and after the algorithm and after the file save and calculate the given time base on those
Zephi#4594: or when
Zephi#4594: from absolute start of int main
Zephi#4594: how are you timing it
Red_3D#3062: are we even calculating the same thing (all primes under 1 billion)
Zephi#4594: question
Red_3D#3062: sieve of Atkin compiled with -O3 -march=native
Red_3D#3062: how did rust do it in < 2s
Zephi#4594: what's your code?
Red_3D#3062: ``` <[newline]> ./sieve 1000000000 <[newline]>   ------------- <[newline]>   algo:  9188ms <[newline]>   file:  6407ms <[newline]>   ------------- <[newline]>   total: 15s <[newline]>   ------------- <[newline]> ```

Red_3D#3062: what sieve are you using now?
RyanT#1426: Just compress it again /s
Zephi#4594: lol
Zephi#4594: if it makes you feel better about rust, all primes <= 1 billion were done in like 2 seconds with the sieve
Red_3D#3062: too late
Zephi#4594: lmao
Zephi#4594: don't blame rust for my mistakes
Zephi#4594: the code was bad
Zephi#4594: no
Red_3D#3062: time to prove that c++ > rust
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Zephi#4594: it's really baaaaaaaed‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Red_3D#3062: 2h?
Red_3D#3062: rust
Red_3D#3062: its rust?
Reese4221#8317: this is so sad
Reese4221#8317: i can only upload 100 megabytes
Reese4221#8317: oh goodie the compressed file is only 243 megabytes
Zephi#4594: this is really baaaaaaaed rust
Red_3D#3062: this is python right?
Zephi#4594: lmao
Zephi#4594: that is very BAD.
Red_3D#3062: n. nowo
Zephi#4594: bruhte force
Reese4221#8317: is that good?
Red_3D#3062: O-O
Reese4221#8317: 3 hours 40 minutes
Reese4221#8317: uh like 3:40?
Red_3D#3062: how long did it take?
Reese4221#8317: im compressing the file give me a while
Red_3D#3062: I got a spare gig
Reese4221#8317: the file it created is 995 megabytes
Red_3D#3062: I think I will try a modern sieve and throwing cuda at the problem‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
DustyAngel47#7299: the virgin ryzen 5 3600 vs the chad ryzen 5 3500
Red_3D#3062: thanks for the tip
Reese4221#8317: in that case go fast
Red_3D#3062: tbh, I just wanna see how fast I can go
Reese4221#8317: i have a ryzen 3 3200G
Reese4221#8317: i could use my main machines CPU
Reese4221#8317: hahaha yea
Red_3D#3062: well, a ryzen 5 3600 thread against a pi thread
Reese4221#8317: eh?
Red_3D#3062: this sounds kina unfair
Reese4221#8317: uh thats all that this is using
Red_3D#3062: any additional rules like only one thread?
Red_3D#3062: oh my, this is gonna be hard to loose
Reese4221#8317: its Zephi's im just using my pi as a calculation machine
Red_3D#3062: then I wanna try beating repsis time
Reese4221#8317: it isnt mine
Red_3D#3062: I wanna try beating your time
Reese4221#8317: 100000000
Reese4221#8317: uhhhh
Red_3D#3062: how many primes are you generating?
Reese4221#8317: `[13234.183890272s] Generating primes... 98.99%`
Broyojo#2667: nice
Reese4221#8317: `[7873.368030105s] Generating primes... 69.99%`
Stefan#5422: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: might as well call it a pri at this point
Reese4221#8317: my poor pi
Reese4221#8317: `[4756.339406785s] Generating primes... 50%`
Zephi#4594: it seems like a tradeoff between cpu and ram
Zephi#4594: is it faster?
Zephi#4594: i'll be honest i thought they were the same thing üò©
Saltypretzel#0321: what
Zephi#4594: what
Red_3D#3062: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes>
Red_3D#3062: thats just brutefoce checking
Red_3D#3062: thats not a sieve
Zephi#4594: this is it making 100 mil primes
Zephi#4594: no threading or anything
Zephi#4594: just iterating a number += 2 each time, checking against all known primes <= sqrt(the number), except two cuz the +=2 skips all evens
Reese4221#8317: Zephi is the wizard making this happen my pi is just the poor computer calculating away
Zephi#4594: pretty much
Red_3D#3062: id guess a simple sieve?
Red_3D#3062: how are you generating them?
Reese4221#8317: heheheh
Reese4221#8317: `[2440.42228574s] Generating primes... 32%`

PseudoGoose#2841: just manually fix that üòÖ
PseudoGoose#2841: ope shit i screwed up a couple things (bottlecap.py line 71)
PseudoGoose#2841: ||interesting cipher but basically it boils down to a polyalphabetic substitution with 2 substitution tables. Once I noticed a repeating pattern of bytes, I figured it might be spaces for indentation since I was assuming this is python. From there I could find newlines (immediately before indentation), and then I had the structure figured out and could start finding and reversing keywords like `import`, which helped me start to figure out the other identifiers ||
PseudoGoose#2841: ||there's one thing (the limit on the number of primes) that I'm not 100% sure what the second digit is, but that doesn't seem to matter much||

Red_3D#3062: heh
DustyAngel47#7299: hmm?
DustyAngel47#7299: 
DustyAngel47#7299: you run it on the image zephi gave
Red_3D#3062: well, I didnt read that
DustyAngel47#7299: its the help message
DustyAngel47#7299: ...
Red_3D#3062: how do you run it on what image
DustyAngel47#7299: the tool outputs it when i run it on the image
DustyAngel47#7299: the code is encoded in the image
DustyAngel47#7299: yep
Zephi#4594: ;)

Zephi#4594: want another?
Red_3D#3062: this is a very elaborate puzzle

DustyAngel47#7299: thanks
Red_3D#3062: xxd
DustyAngel47#7299: also dumb question but what are you using to get a hex view like that
Red_3D#3062: lets do analysis on the frequency of specific bytes to find out if there is a correlation to letter frequencies
Red_3D#3062: I knew that
DustyAngel47#7299: it isnt elf, there is no header
Red_3D#3062: wait
Red_3D#3062: wait
Red_3D#3062: there are occasional *special* bytes
DustyAngel47#7299: divide all numbers in the file by 2?
Red_3D#3062: split the file into smaller pieces?
DustyAngel47#7299: ü§î
DustyAngel47#7299: division?
Red_3D#3062: I still have no clue how to proceed
Red_3D#3062: ok
Red_3D#3062: is the data in the last screenshot *I send* relevant

Red_3D#3062: is there anything here?
FacePox#2708: 
Red_3D#3062: pwese
Red_3D#3062: what you trying to say

Red_3D#3062: rescaled and removed alpha channel
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: yee
DustyAngel47#7299: what if each blob of colour should be interpreted as one pixel?
DustyAngel47#7299: that is true
Red_3D#3062: multiple pixels per pixel
Red_3D#3062: wait its the wrong size
Red_3D#3062: the file command would have found that
Red_3D#3062: thats not how this works
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Just brute force formats
Red_3D#3062: the file command just says png
DustyAngel47#7299: what
DustyAngel47#7299: so it isnt?
DustyAngel47#7299: i've no idea
DustyAngel47#7299: mp3?
DustyAngel47#7299: wav?
Red_3D#3062: what frigin format
Red_3D#3062: the alpha channel is totally empty
DustyAngel47#7299: is it audio data?
DustyAngel47#7299: ü§î
Red_3D#3062: please
DustyAngel47#7299: and sound
DustyAngel47#7299: so thumbs up
Red_3D#3062: you cant just post strange noise and dont say anything
Red_3D#3062: the channels look pretty similar
Red_3D#3062: what are you trying to tell us

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ah yes, long titles, my favorite
PseudoGoose#2841: i think this is the original video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KvxOuC7Bhc
PseudoGoose#2841: i almost just died from laughter ü§£
CrispyPin#1149: Correct
DustyAngel47#7299: you wouldn't download an among us
CrispyPin#1149: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: because my brain is like ‚Äúwell what if the torrent dies and you can never get those files‚Äù
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but I don‚Äôt wanna leave out the scans
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: very
DustyAngel47#7299: once again, very (un)economical in storage space
DustyAngel47#7299: also imagine using torrents instead of Totally_Legal ddl services smh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (140MB scans aren‚Äôt that weird, sadly)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: now if there‚Äôs one thing png absolutely cannot compress well...
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you basically have a pattern that alternates between color and white constantly
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: meaning if your scan dpi is high enough
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: fun fact: printers print with little dots
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: then you have the scans... god the scans...
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: 13MB or something, those are digital
DustyAngel47#7299: sounds very (un)economical in storage space
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: yes, ten thousand
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: there‚Äôs some albums with 10000x10000 covers, for example
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: also my own music collection is fucking awful in terms of... everything, due to those torrents
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: fuck why did you mmake me consider that
DustyAngel47#7299: alright it has gone in the opposite direction of "I don't like where this is going"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I am not looking forward to that
Verlio_H#0201: do it in assembly
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: tried to make a music player
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: me, a back-end assembly programmer
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: what if
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: so I was thinking
DustyAngel47#7299: i dont like where this is going
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: reason I can‚Äôt change the files: legal torrents \:)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or jpop as j-pop
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: like displaying tag Null as [unknown]
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *without changing any music files on disk*, of course
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: a feature I think is pretty basic is tag overrides
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but it‚Äôs... far from perfect
DustyAngel47#7299: i have never managed to find a good one (at least on linux)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: musicbee (in the screenshot above) is the best I‚Äôve been able to find for desktop so far
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: also, music players are pretty bad overall
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I wonder how much space this would physically take up on your shelf
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it has been done
Verlio_H#0201: yes
Broyojo#2667: does Rust have digital or analog components?
Broyojo#2667: also yes, the Rust programming language
Broyojo#2667: yeah free shipping is a psychological thing

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: also memes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: inb4 ipv4 address
Red_3D#3062: would something like `beta` be part of that string?
Red_3D#3062: so... is it a string or a vector of values
Red_3D#3062: hmm
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: we don't do that here
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: hmm
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...right?
Red_3D#3062: ignore .z and you got yourself a float smh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: like x.y.z
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: apis use normal versioning
Red_3D#3062: so NAN would fit here
Red_3D#3062: apis can have decimal places so they're floats
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: std::optional?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: uh uh
Red_3D#3062: I think they were asking for the value, not a reference
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: nullptr
DustyAngel47#7299: which version of the r34 api did you use to download all this
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: pd2assets
Red_3D#3062: lmfao
DustyAngel47#7299: > pd2ass
Red_3D#3062: thicc
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: why are there so many files
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: had to make some space, decided to throw out an old directory I used for messing with payday 2 assets
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I should go get the character CDs of K-on

Red_3D#3062: there is exactly one instance of cat ears
DustyAngel47#7299: on the fallout fanon, there is an entire section for my state that has literally no ciatations lmao
Red_3D#3062: someone put far too much effort into this
DustyAngel47#7299: chances are its just someone's headcanon that got put on there
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: how
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: wait they even know the blood type
DustyAngel47#7299: also i can see the pixels smh
DustyAngel47#7299: fandom wikias do that a lot for some dumb reason
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...amazing effort, but why
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: I cant make a screenshot

Verlio_H#0201: much lower than I expected
Verlio_H#0201: in e my entire phone number including the county code is in the 550-600 million range (not giving exact numbers for obvious reasons)
Verlio_H#0201: holy shit
Verlio_H#0201: but ignoring the last digit my phone number is in the 200-300 million range
Verlio_H#0201: another website says my fone number was not found in the first 2 billion digits of pi
Verlio_H#0201: on angio pi seach page I can get up to the last 3 digits (ignoring leading 1)
Red_3D#3062: ok, let me do a billion
CrispyPin#1149: do more until you find your phone number
Verlio_H#0201: pretty sure thats 248 million
Red_3D#3062: 250 million (248mb)
CrispyPin#1149: how many
Red_3D#3062: thats a lot of digits
Red_3D#3062: it wrote pi to a file
Red_3D#3062: HOLY crap
Verlio_H#0201: #stop using computers to make the universe last longer
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Then yes that would be the case
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If this was an entropy graph plotting CPU woosh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I mean
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Wh
Red_3D#3062: more instructions per second = more entropy. right?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I thought that was an entropy graph for a sec

CrispyPin#1149: but thats impressive
Red_3D#3062: the download will take 30min
CrispyPin#1149: i assume its not linear?
Red_3D#3062: got 250 million digits in 30s
CrispyPin#1149: what
Red_3D#3062: actually, I think calculating pi with y-cruncher will be faster than the download for me
CrispyPin#1149: thats what stackoverflow said
CrispyPin#1149: yea
Red_3D#3062: maybe use awk instead?

Red_3D#3062: I guess you could also just run y-cruncher for a few days
CrispyPin#1149: yea
CrispyPin#1149: https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/
Red_3D#3062: ah, mit
Red_3D#3062: where did you get that many digits?
Red_3D#3062: :O thats pretty cool
CrispyPin#1149: it does if i remove the +46 (or 0 as i usually write it)
Red_3D#3062: I'd imagine the chance is pretty small
Red_3D#3062: should be no problem
CrispyPin#1149: i hope grep likes a gigabyte file

Red_3D#3062: i'd suggest not sending porn as it would violate the rules of our lovely community
DustyAngel47#7299: it blocked that meme
DustyAngel47#7299: i mean
DustyAngel47#7299: i would try sending porn, but then it'll probably go through because i dont think their filters are very good
FacePox#2708: Penis

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well I watched it
DustyAngel47#7299: does not exactly sound enticing though
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's not that bad
DustyAngel47#7299: do i wanna know?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Though it's kinda hard to miss considering what the title is
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: >opens her legs for anyone including her own brother <[newline]> I was not expecting the meme to be this close to the show

MiniStumpy#5653: Wtf is wrong with me xD
MiniStumpy#5653: When Jimmy realized he pooped his pants
CrispyPin#1149: and i prefer milk, perfect
Dragon Lord#6944: I didn't realize until just now, but that's a troubling thought
Dragon Lord#6944: There are more odd days than even days
Red_3D#3062: yes, I also thought about that but could not formulate a meaningful statement
CrispyPin#1149: when people ask if you put the milk or cereal first, and you respond with "we take turns, I have cereal on even days"

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: well

Saltypretzel#0321: Also why pay for so many wires when like less than a quarter of them is used at once
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: alternatives from the time weren‚Äôt exactly great
Saltypretzel#0321: Well don‚Äôt use scart
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: well don‚Äôt loop it

Red_3D#3062: idk if flac is the source

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *other than the fact you don't have to extract the files
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I already have a perfectly usable version in the main game, I don't see why I'd want another one
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if I'm buying the soundtrack, at least give me the full package
Red_3D#3062: oof
CrispyPin#1149: amazing
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: for some reason they decided it was a good idea to make an entire DLC for the soundtrack <[newline]> **and then only put 320kbps mp3 in it**
Red_3D#3062: omfg, its real
CrispyPin#1149: lmao
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it's the soundtrack DLC for astroneer
Red_3D#3062: looks like astroneer but its not on the actual store page <https://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/ASTRONEER/>
CrispyPin#1149: what game is this
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ah yes
DustyAngel47#7299: although there are like 3 possible reasons it could've failed the way it did lol
DustyAngel47#7299: ver sad, `E` does not work properly

DustyAngel47#7299: 
Saltypretzel#0321: Scart is disgusting
DustyAngel47#7299: thats exactly my thought
Red_3D#3062: inb4 it just starts vibrating if you put in a audio signal
DustyAngel47#7299: in theory it wouldn't be *that* hard i think
DustyAngel47#7299: i would buy a headphone jack to string converter

Red_3D#3062: you dont even know what your app does?
Red_3D#3062: iirc?
DustyAngel47#7299: its just a userscript that embeds https://youtube.com/tv iirc
DustyAngel47#7299: its not even a modification of the app
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~actually its just youtube-adfree with a different logo~~

Dragon Lord#6944: This is funny just because of how accurate it is to actual communication standards XD
Dragon Lord#6944: https://youtu.be/IbZx_zCpC-Q
Dragon Lord#6944: That's when you know it's a good one XD
Broyojo#2667: yeah, or sometimes some articles become true years later
Dragon Lord#6944: It still is, but their whole thing is that the stories have to be at least somewhat believable to be put on their site. They're usually pretty obvious if you read the articles or put more than a half of a second of thought into what the title is saying, but people still fall for it because they have two brain cells that are too busy arguing like a dysfunctional married couple to keep them from lashing out at an obvious joke.
Dragon Lord#6944: Every single one of them is so outlandish that there is no way it is possibly real if you read it. The headlines can sometimes be realistic enough to confuse people though.
DustyAngel47#7299: it used to be obvious enough it wasnt required
RyanT#1426: are they trying to tell people fake news or is there a thing saying "It's just a joke!"
Dragon Lord#6944: They also have a YouTube channel that is pretty funny, if a little raunchy. I enjoy it :)
Dragon Lord#6944: r/atetheonion is a pretty good sub
Dragon Lord#6944: The Onion based its name off of the idea of tricking someone into thinking that it's a real news source so they would 'eat the onion'
Broyojo#2667: yes it is satire
RyanT#1426: Is that a joke news source?
Broyojo#2667: lol
Dragon Lord#6944: I didn't notice the onion logo on this when I first saw it, and just chalked it up to California being California XD

FacePox#2708: Base 12 might be the wrong way of putting it, maybe it was an old way of counting livestock based on 12s
FacePox#2708: Well that‚Äôs why I said it merged with base 10 over time
PseudoGoose#2841: like seventy is 10*7
PseudoGoose#2841: or was "hundred" 12*10
PseudoGoose#2841: if it was base 12, wouldn't a hundred be a gross (144)?
Broyojo#2667: yes
FacePox#2708: Very interesting patterns, don‚Äôt you think?
FacePox#2708: Twelve means two left over. Hundred used to refer to 120, with 100 being known as a short hundred. The fact that a dozen is 12.
FacePox#2708: There is some evidence suggesting that ancient Germanic peoples may have used a base 12 system that slowly merged with and was replaced with the base 10 system

Broyojo#2667: oh I forgot, the 1.6e7 is negative
Broyojo#2667: yeah
PseudoGoose#2841: but yes, this does reach the limit of single-precision (roughly 7 digits) so the +1 and +1 from the two inner terms are lost as underflow
PseudoGoose#2841: that's dot product, right?

Broyojo#2667: I guess it really is "single" precision

DustyAngel47#7299: despite fast food being his career
DustyAngel47#7299: and the first 5 minutes is just spongebob telling people that if they keep eating fast food, their arteries will clog and die
DustyAngel47#7299: with a monolouge of apocolyptic events
DustyAngel47#7299: like it opens with a video of donald trump
DustyAngel47#7299: i found the sequel to spongebob in iran on youtube (for context, spongebob in iran was a persian (iirc) bootleg spongebob movie) and honesty, if it wasnt for the fact it seems to be in persian, it feels like a parody

JoshuaSpeedy#3545: üëÄ üòõ -> that looks yummy

Broyojo#2667: I guess I can understand that one
Broyojo#2667: ``` <[newline]> üíäüîûüíß -> IV drip```
Broyojo#2667: also just generated this
Saltypretzel#0321: I think paper maybe went to papercut or something
Broyojo#2667: maybe it is "poop is banned so you kill poop with knife which is therefore toilet paper?"
Broyojo#2667: I don't understand it but maybe it is just a higher level of thinking
Broyojo#2667: also this ``` <[newline]> üö´üí©üî™ -> toilet paper```
Broyojo#2667: from these examples gpt3 generated this: ``` <[newline]> üö∂‚òùüèªüëü -> hitchhike```
Broyojo#2667: or this one ``` <[newline]> üî•üòà‚¨ÖüèÉ -> go to hell <[newline]> ```
Broyojo#2667: I am asking the discord since there are special discord emojis we can use in the translator
Broyojo#2667: and so once I get this data I can effectively talk in very cryptic emoji
Broyojo#2667: so like one example is ``` <[newline]> üö´üò≠ü•õ‚§µüí¶ -> don't cry over spilled milk```

DustyAngel47#7299: but why the fuck would you even be looking up people's political donations

Verlio_H#0201: my house is also almost a century old, we have the old wavy glass in some parts
Deleted User#0000: yes
DustyAngel47#7299: (our electricians put that into other things though, such as installing outlets that dont actually do anything on almost every plug in the house)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That sounds very annoying
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Why though
ieee 802.11ac#6337: it's over a century old
ieee 802.11ac#6337: at least for my house it kinda makes sense
DustyAngel47#7299: it is very dumb
DustyAngel47#7299: yes
ieee 802.11ac#6337: for whatever reason my house occasionally has inverted light switches so i have to remember which ones are confusing
DustyAngel47#7299: can confirm that light switch is upside down, thats how all the light switches are in our house (in murrica) <[newline]> *but* <[newline]> apparently all the electricians in south carolina dont know the difference between up and down, and put it in upside down half the time, and i know which way is right because there is lettering on the switch that says which way it is supposed to go

Deleted User#0000: idk
Deleted User#0000: i only ask them as a joke
Deleted User#0000: i'm only getting more confused
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Do you ever ask fellow sentient beings if they're human?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Do you ever ask people if they're hu- actually if they're people they are human
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Maybe repsi isn't human?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Idk
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: So
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I never asked repsi
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Exactly what I said
Verlio_H#0201: my brain after seeing this conversation: dies
Deleted User#0000: what did you ask
Deleted User#0000: whajt do you mean you don't think you asked
Deleted User#0000: yes we're discussing them
Deleted User#0000: but also don't
Deleted User#0000: i understand
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ~~if I don't forget again, it's a hard habit to break~~
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: We are discussing repsi right
Deleted User#0000: im confused
Deleted User#0000: what
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Don't think I ever asked
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I'm not sure if repsi is a person
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Person?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Actually
Deleted User#0000: (please don't call me repsi anymore lol)
Deleted User#0000: i'm zephi
Deleted User#0000: idk who that is
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Haven't seen em in a while though
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The person repsi
Deleted User#0000: also who's repsi
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: No this is just a question
Deleted User#0000: is this some homestuck shit
Deleted User#0000: what do you mean
Deleted User#0000: am i awake?
Verlio_H#0201: no repsi is dead
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Repsi are you awake or not?
Deleted User#0000: that's the only person i watched a lot of on the whole "Ess Emm Pee"
Deleted User#0000: okay that mighjt change my mind honestly
Deleted User#0000: damn...............
Deleted User#0000: rest in peace slimecicle i guess
Deleted User#0000: damn
Deleted User#0000: to associate with that person is to associate to someone who's very much willing to manipulate their fans
Deleted User#0000: i view on a similar tier
Deleted User#0000: "dream smp"
Deleted User#0000: and anyone who touches that godawful thing
Deleted User#0000: very relatable
Deleted User#0000: are you a human? buy our product, made by humans, for humans
Deleted User#0000: soooooooo fucking relatable dream
Deleted User#0000: i mean i'm pretty sure everyone wears *that* mask at some point in their life
Deleted User#0000: and i don't mean *that* mask i mean the mask of "haha i did the speed run and it was the Mod dev's fault haha funny"
Deleted User#0000: he doesn't need glasses he just needs to take the mask off
Deleted User#0000: THAT'S WHY HE NEEDS GLASSES
Deleted User#0000: THAT'S WHY HE GETS BAD GRADES
Deleted User#0000: HE CAN'T SEE BECAUSE HE'S WEARING THE MASK
Deleted User#0000: WAIT
Deleted User#0000: i wonder if that was an accident too
Deleted User#0000: the pastebin's been deleted
Deleted User#0000: oh that's very interesting
Deleted User#0000: i should actually read his response
Deleted User#0000: he made mask!!! wowww!!!! i relate to this song in soooooooo many ways!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Deleted User#0000: oh yeah let's just ignore the fact that he deleted his mod folder out of rage and then blamed his mod dev team instead of actually taking responsibility for the shit
Deleted User#0000: this whole "mask" song bs is just him manipulating his fans once again
Deleted User#0000: i  do have preconceived negative expectations of anything made by dream
Deleted User#0000: e
Deleted User#0000: I'm probably the kind of person jimmy was talking about in relation to dream
Deleted User#0000: idk
Deleted User#0000: yes i know it's probably symbolism like "you do not see the world properly! get glasses [symbolically]"
Deleted User#0000: maybe that's why you get such bad grades
Deleted User#0000: well you should probably get glasses before the eyestrain wears your eyes out so bad you can't fake speedruns anymore
Deleted User#0000: in your case, a mask i assume
Deleted User#0000: as a person who wears glasses it annoys me to no end when i am unable to properly wear red/blue 3d glasses at the theater
Deleted User#0000: i get why
Deleted User#0000: ah
Deleted User#0000: what's wrong with wearing glasses dream
Reese4221#8317: zephi thats a strange face
Deleted User#0000: very unstrange face
Deleted User#0000: much unlike this one
Deleted User#0000: strange faces
Deleted User#0000: always being judged by a bunch of strange faces, huh dream?
Deleted User#0000: :)
Deleted User#0000: you do get a lot of discord angry face emojis when you gaslight your fans and the entire speedrunning community for a year
Deleted User#0000: well yeah dream
Deleted User#0000: 
Verlio_H#0201: its a monitor but with a laptop style hinge so you can close it and use the back side of the monitor as a surface
Deleted User#0000: WHAT
Deleted User#0000: THIS ISN'T A LAPTOP
Verlio_H#0201: clearly you've never seen a laptop
Verlio_H#0201: lol
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: when would someone ever want to rotate their monitor in THAT direction?
Deleted User#0000: held up like this
Deleted User#0000: also do they make monitors that are like
Deleted User#0000: look at how smudged / dirty the edge looks
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: i really don't like the inconsistent realism on the door and monitor
Verlio_H#0201: yeah
Deleted User#0000: then again, it's not a human
Deleted User#0000: that's how humans open doors
Deleted User#0000: the paper cutout should be on the other side i think
Deleted User#0000: what motherfucker enters a door that opens in that direction FROM that direction
Deleted User#0000: also
Verlio_H#0201: that is literally a paper cutout
Deleted User#0000: but there's no line separating the walls
Deleted User#0000: but the door is on the northeastern wall, from dream's perspective
Verlio_H#0201: is that human made out of paper
Deleted User#0000: the light switch seems to come from the "northwestern" wall, from dream's perspective
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: this image alone is really confusing
Deleted User#0000: is that window casing light there?
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: but you can see a window over here
Deleted User#0000: wait
Deleted User#0000: are there two beds in the same room and one is mattressless and has no painting?
Deleted User#0000: i have no idea
Deleted User#0000: his bed changed direction i guess??
Deleted User#0000: i'm guessing that's a window???
Verlio_H#0201: what is the shadow blocking the light
Deleted User#0000: is it like more like "on the surface i am a cultured individual with paintings and i actually make my bed but deep down i just have a sheet of A4 paper stapled to my wall and i'm too lazy to make my bed so it's just a mattress with nothing on it"
Deleted User#0000: is htis a separate room
Deleted User#0000: myh favorite lyric
Deleted User#0000: that's what the mattress
Deleted User#0000: but the bed in that one doesn't have a sheet or anything it's just a mattress
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: this painting only exists for one scene
Deleted User#0000: also
Deleted User#0000: lmfao
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Went from "critical analysis" to "YO THAT'S MY TYPE" real quick
Deleted User#0000: YOU KNOW I LIKE THAT SHIT
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: DAMN HE GOT THEM THICC EYEBROWS AND THEM CUTIE EYELASHES
Verlio_H#0201: rip
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: not to mention he breaks the same arm again
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: it looks like the band springs back which doesn't make any sense
Deleted User#0000: here you can see more "ai artifacting" because idk what else to call it
Deleted User#0000: 
Verlio_H#0201: ohno
Deleted User#0000: except here you can literally see it going into his head
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: you can see a similar thing happening with the mask thing
Deleted User#0000: not sure what his fingers are doing in the first frame either
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: when putting the mask on, his hand clips through his hair
Deleted User#0000: 1:56 - his shirt is doing some fuckin demonic shit around his collar
Verlio_H#0201: lol
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: his hand pulls away before the top comes off
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: the shading on the top of the pill bottle doesn't make any sense
Verlio_H#0201: I guess the angle
Verlio_H#0201: lmao why is the sleve on one side so much bigger than the other
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: the length of his torso is also inconsistent
Dragon Lord#6944: depends on where you are, lots of places have the switches with up == off
Verlio_H#0201: a lot of the lights in my house have 2 switches so it never is consistant which is on or off
Deleted User#0000: careful dream don't break that elbow you need those to fake speedruns my man
Red_3D#3062: The light is way too dark for that kind of effort
Deleted User#0000: where i live at least, up is usually on
Red_3D#3062: Can confirm the sss stuff, that's most likely more than in reality
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: his light switch is mounted upside down
Stenodyon#8192: subsurface scattering was probably cranked the f up to make him look softer
Verlio_H#0201: like no cap it looks very similar to something an ai would make for the most part
Verlio_H#0201: probably was
Deleted User#0000: and then right after it's fine
Deleted User#0000: why is the frame after it like this was this made by a fucking ai
Deleted User#0000: why is there finger so red here the lighting isn't that strong
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: frame right after:
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: don't miss this single frame where the fabric doesn't have physics yet and it looks like they only modeled the back of the shirt?

DustyAngel47#7299: ~~i agree with this statement via the Drake Opinion Scale~~
PseudoGoose#2841: (i know /s)
PseudoGoose#2841: ah yes, the entirely objective subjective opinion standard <:thonk:570493654834348032>
DustyAngel47#7299: oh wow I didn't even catch that one
DustyAngel47#7299: guess we just have differing opinions here ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  <[newline]> > it looks better than Toy Story (1999) does <[newline]> don't diss the best toy story movie up in here /s  <[newline]> > 3D animation is hard <[newline]> of course, but i mean you gotta have some expectations for how many people dream hired, with not even the animation itself at times, but the sheer amount of errors and mistakes and unclear things (literally and figuratively)
DustyAngel47#7299: np
Jimmy#8080: Ah no I just misremembered the year, my bad. Thank you for the correction
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~the original came out in '95, are you talking about Toy Story 2?~~
Verlio_H#0201: merged hands pog
Jimmy#8080: I honestly think it looks completely fine. Like, it looks better than Toy Story (1999) does, and that's still an excellent film. 3D animation is hard
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: my favorite image
VigilanteHobo#1873: are they gonna animate the sus version
DustyAngel47#7299: ofc not, I rate all songs individually based on the Drake Opinion Scale and attempt to use it as objectively as I can
DustyAngel47#7299: tbh I don't think the song is that bad (although, imo the singing isn't exactly the greatest (granted mine isn't exactly better)), its just the music video is... this, and it brings down the whole experience imo
Jimmy#8080: I sure hope you're not so dismissive and contemptuous when I start sharing my original music
Jimmy#8080: I think you are being unreasonably harsh because you have preconceived negative expectations of anything made by Dream. I think that's a great song and a great music video.

FacePox#2708: The "you are NOT normal" and the "normal pills" as reductive and just stupid as they are, are the most relatable for me
DustyAngel47#7299: oh my god the fabric on the shirt moves independently of dream sometimes
DustyAngel47#7299: the third time this has shown up
DustyAngel47#7299: when you don't have the right to an iphone but want to use a blown up iphone se anyways
DustyAngel47#7299: they use the same discord "screenshot" both when he's a kid and when he's a teen
DustyAngel47#7299: dream be looking like he's about to be the next horror movie villain
DustyAngel47#7299: i like this trashcan where you can see the flat metal bottom
DustyAngel47#7299: bruh the entire first half of the video was a flashback?
DustyAngel47#7299: or are they even flashbacks?
DustyAngel47#7299: damn these flashbacks are more confusing than the saw movies
DustyAngel47#7299: 
DustyAngel47#7299: like how do you look worse than the playmobil movie???

DustyAngel47#7299: like its coming out in october, they must have *something*
DustyAngel47#7299: that seems like the type of thing you might wanna do for a game
DustyAngel47#7299: gonna show gameplay?
DustyAngel47#7299: are they like
DustyAngel47#7299: am now watching the trailer
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And that's because that's the only cod game I ever played
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It looks like cod black ops 3 but with upgraded graphics
DustyAngel47#7299: Impossible
DanielGJ44#4557: EA, please give us another Burnout game that is true to its roots and not a need for speed reskin
Verlio_H#0201: yes
Red_3D#3062: ext4
Verlio_H#0201: just sell a drive in a format that can only be read on linux, profit
DustyAngel47#7299: is that supposed to be a surprise?
DustyAngel47#7299: true
Red_3D#3062: just have a 1tb etx4 and a 1mb ntfs partition lol
DustyAngel47#7299: <:thonking:432741465844875264>
DustyAngel47#7299: which gets people on the pathway to everyone installing linux
DanielGJ44#4557: Also, apparently battlefield 2042 is a thing now and it looks extremely bland, overdone, and underwhelming by the trailer
Red_3D#3062: would you really wanna do that tho
DustyAngel47#7299: but then i can teach about partitioning
Red_3D#3062: that'd just give you angry customers
DustyAngel47#7299: profit
DustyAngel47#7299: most people dont know what partitions are
DustyAngel47#7299: make a 1gb partition in the factory of a 1tb disk
DanielGJ44#4557: that actually makes me wonder if I could sell a drive as "possible storage capacity: 1TB" and then "Digital Storage Capacity: 1GB"
Broyojo#2667: true
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~could probably fit a few dream stans in there~~
Broyojo#2667: 
Broyojo#2667: 
Broyojo#2667: dream stans in a nut shell

DustyAngel47#7299: oh my fucking god the normal pills
DustyAngel47#7299: there is literally a lyric that says, `That's what the mask is` like what
DustyAngel47#7299: til you need a whole damn song to tell your fanbase what a mask is
Broyojo#2667: oh god

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Damn
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: There's multiple works called "metamorphosis"?
MiniStumpy#5653: ok
Jimmy#8080: Since he's pseudo-famous I occasionally see his takes and they usually make me roll my eyes. Particularly on subjects I'm knowledgeable about
Jimmy#8080: He also coined the term "meme", which was first used in a book of his on genetics research in IIRC the 1980s
Jimmy#8080: He's mostly famous for advocating against religion and for atheism, which he does with supreme jackassery in my opinion
DustyAngel47#7299: i'm assuming this guy is infamous for terrible takes or something?
MiniStumpy#5653: xD

DustyAngel47#7299: ||this is so fucking hilarious, he says the music the """demon""" picked was a german song, despite the fact that the song would have no effect on him because he doesnt know german???||

Broyojo#2667: though
Broyojo#2667: his videos are quite entertaining
Broyojo#2667: JCS has been showing up a lot in my recommendations
Broyojo#2667: yeah that faking was so bad

DustyAngel47#7299: ||and despite the circumstances, I'm honestly laughing at how bad this faking is||
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: yeah
DustyAngel47#7299: currently watching the video that everyone is getting recommended, apparently

Saltypretzel#0321: It‚Äôs quite a physical value, so I don‚Äôt see what they disagree on.
Saltypretzel#0321: Interesting. I wonder what the differences are
Saltypretzel#0321: yes
Reese4221#8317: still smol
Saltypretzel#0321: Of course yeah, it‚Äôs not really 2nm, it‚Äôs a 2nm equivalent. If it were really only 2nm, it would be like 4 silicon atoms across lol.
Reese4221#8317: thats smol
DanielGJ44#4557: My comment was moreso on my understanding that processor manufacturers uses a different method of calculating this, so it's not a useful metric to compare Intel versus AMD versus Qualcomm on for example
FacePox#2708: https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/24/marketingandpr.colombia <[newline]> https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/pdf-investor-statement-for-human-rights-and-in-support-of-the-us-alien-tort-statute/
Saltypretzel#0321: Very cool tech
Saltypretzel#0321: Yes just recently, IBM made 2nm
PseudoGoose#2841: it was brought down to 5nm in 2020
Saltypretzel#0321: The nm now is quite interesting. It used to mean the smallest width of the gate of a transistor. A while ago, like before 2010, there was no FinFET in production. The gates of the transistors were 2D, so this works perfectly well. However, now, we have 3D gates. These gates are not much smaller physically, but the 3D nature allows them to have the properties that a smaller gate would have. So the nm nowadays is *equivalent gate length*.
RyanT#1426: Did they really do that?!
Saltypretzel#0321: Heh. New research brought it down to ~2nm

Verlio_H#0201: lmao
FacePox#2708: it was hilarious
FacePox#2708: let me see if I can find it
FacePox#2708: so if you remember back in January when  the capitol was stormed. There was a photoshop thread on something awful where people would photoshop images from the storming to be funny. Someone replaced a painting with that image of that well endowed black man. That photoshop was used in an official FBI document about the incident.
DanielGJ44#4557: I think it's been adequately spoilered and marked but I suppose technically yes
DanielGJ44#4557: Easily bypass-able using the old link but still scummy
DanielGJ44#4557: I love how new reddit on mobile forces you to open NSFW in mobile app
Reese4221#8317: isnt rule 3 a thing

jackson535#1361: i am insinuating that intel will be on 14nm when my great great grandson can build robots
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean I guess relative to the rest of the company's product it means something
Dragon Lord#6944: fair
DanielGJ44#4557: Yes but those numbers don't really mean anything anyways
Dragon Lord#6944: aren't we down to ~8nm?
Dragon Lord#6944: 14nm?
DanielGJ44#4557: INTEL BAD

DanielGJ44#4557: So tl;dr this whole conversation basically sums up the whole adage "buy nice or buy twice" and no one has argued against that

DanielGJ44#4557: Yes sir
ieee 802.11ac#6337: time to eat my gaming pc /s
jackson535#1361: a common mode of failure from a major design flaw
jackson535#1361: the gaming headsets that break are similar to buying a table that deforms more and more each day you use it until it snaps in half
jackson535#1361: but the fundamental mechanisms that headphones have are not devices that work less and less over time
jackson535#1361: some of the gaming headsets clearly are
DanielGJ44#4557: And in US tax law as well
DanielGJ44#4557: In Canadian tax law, headphones (and almost literally every other electronic) are classified as consumable for expense purposes and that is what I go by
jackson535#1361: and a device with a silicon die that subjects it's motherboard to heat and deformation is also a consumable
jackson535#1361: unless that battery is intended to be replaced
jackson535#1361: a device with a li-ion battery is a consumable
jackson535#1361: a product that has a finite lifespan and takes wear and tear during use
jackson535#1361: consumable as in
jackson535#1361: i don't know how that would work or what that would look like
DanielGJ44#4557: You're right
jackson535#1361: its kind of funny to imagine speakers deteriorating every 2 or 3 years
jackson535#1361: but people who make music don't just chew through speakers or headphones
jackson535#1361: of course there are other things
jackson535#1361: not limited to laptops exactly
jackson535#1361: that really only becomes true when you have these enormous corporate prosumer companies making consumable products like laptops
jackson535#1361: warranty has nothing to do with expected lifetime for many types of products
jackson535#1361: but how many times do you replace your desk
jackson535#1361: a desk may have a warranty of 1 year
Verlio_H#0201: clearly consumable
Verlio_H#0201: "Eating headphones because I am dumb (Gone wrong) (Gone sexual)"
jackson535#1361: thats just the nature of that product
jackson535#1361: you may buy some big passive speakers with a 1 year warranty, but speakers don't go bad either unless driven too hard
DanielGJ44#4557: Someone purchasing $1000 headphones, I feel, would be enough of an enthusiast to replace/upgrade them fairly often (as most of my audiophile friends do)
jackson535#1361: headphones aren't really consumable products
DanielGJ44#4557: I can rail off anecdotes about specific products too but I don't know really if that would be helpful, so I will not
jackson535#1361: decades are the average values here
jackson535#1361: those aren't outlier values
DanielGJ44#4557: Well, I should say "mean lifecycle" for wear items. It's feasible that someone would replace headphones after 5 years, so that is what a warranty could be set at
jackson535#1361: and even audio technica ath m50x are often still in use since they came out. the headband's pretty worn out though
jackson535#1361: a $70 headphone
jackson535#1361: same with akg k240s
jackson535#1361: very regularly
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean that's a pretty standard quality control fact
jackson535#1361: sennheiser hd600's regularly last 30 years
jackson535#1361: strongly disagree
DanielGJ44#4557: So using warranties to gauge how long you'll get out of a product is a good measure
jackson535#1361: not with headphones
DanielGJ44#4557: With regards to lifetime of a product, most warranties are offered for larger/more expensive purchases by setting the warranty at the tail end of two standard deviations of the mean reliability
Verlio_H#0201: 1 dollar earbuds from walmart are the only thing anyone would ever need smh
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm not sure if you are attempting this but I want to make sure that you aren't using my two failed headsets as evidence against Dan's point. Both of those headsets were under 30 USD which of course are going to fail after a few years of literally constant use
jackson535#1361: with headphones the earpads are the only part that experiences that wear and tear on well designed headphones
jackson535#1361: it's not the same situation as laptops for example. with laptops there is wear and tear in many ways
jackson535#1361: it's pretty rare for certain headphones to fail
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I had no level of control over choosing them nor cared at the time
ForLoveOfCats#4111: When you are 12 and need a pair of headphones for school stuff you use what you are given by your parents lmao
DanielGJ44#4557: ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
DanielGJ44#4557: Because nothing is a given or guaranteed lifecycle wise when manufactured under regular tolerance
ForLoveOfCats#4111: You did not let me finish üëÄ
ForLoveOfCats#4111: My current set I selected myself (AKG K92, seemed good for the price point)
jackson535#1361: so why not get one that you won't have to replace
ForLoveOfCats#4111: up until now they've either been cheap walmart headsets or a knockoff crap headset from amazon
DanielGJ44#4557: There are many poorly designed SUVs,  I don't make the conclusion that all SUVs are bad, is kinda my point in a different analogy
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Over the past ~8 or so years I'm on my third
jackson535#1361: how many headphones have you gone through forloveofcats
DanielGJ44#4557: I use headphones for noise suppression and private listening and my monitor speakers are completely serviceable if I can't use headphones
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So I disagree with such a pointed statement about how others do or do not use their systems
jackson535#1361: if it's designed poorly, which a lot of them are, there will be problems
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I literally never show people content on my main system, and I sit with my headphones on comfortably 12+ hours a day (and have for years with multiple sets of headphones at this point)
jackson535#1361: well these are all standard design elements of headphones
jackson535#1361: yeah
DanielGJ44#4557: It just depends
DanielGJ44#4557: These are all directly related to an individual manufacturer's design and not unique to any specific kind of headphones; pilot's headphones have these features and are extremely reliable
jackson535#1361: I don't understand how someone could gimp themselves like that in such a luxury computer environment
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Bold of you to assume I ever have other people around when I'm using my main computer system lol (which has no speakers hooked up)
jackson535#1361: or what happens if your ears get hot with your headset
jackson535#1361: irl
jackson535#1361: like how do you show someone a cool video you found
jackson535#1361: most of these gaming setups don't even have speakers
ForLoveOfCats#4111: My own experience with high end audio is extremely limited so I'm not trying to engage in anything too deep in this conversation, just wanted to toss that in
jackson535#1361: that's not the point i was trying to make
DanielGJ44#4557: I enjoy his old iPod reviews though
jackson535#1361: i agree completely as well
DanielGJ44#4557: Basically my opinion too, I've seen his stuff
jackson535#1361: microphone, earpad mechanism, headstrap, hinge, and detachable cable design
DanielGJ44#4557: There's nothing about a gaming headset that makes it inherently unreliable lol
DanielGJ44#4557: If you buy hype gamer turtle beach WalMart headphones then yeah, 6 months
jackson535#1361: that's very impressive for a gaming headset
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I really enjoy DankPods on the youtubes for audio related content and one of his big things is that you don't have to go crazy to get a good experience and that a lot of lower cost headphones that some snobs might sneer at can be enjoyable if the specific audio experience they give is what you want or like. Also he gives the "default iPhone earbuds" a fairly high rating lol
jackson535#1361: the akg240s's are only $70
DanielGJ44#4557: I've used my gaming headset for I think 7ish years now so I cannot attest to that
jackson535#1361: well designed headphones can last a lifetime
jackson535#1361: people often replace their akg240s headphones every 45 years <:bobby_dab:692790273490550855>
DanielGJ44#4557: Also the upper model of my car's premium sound package is literally the speakers in the base model plus a fancy badge, and it's my understanding many manufacturers do the same
jackson535#1361: people often replace their gaming headsets when they break each 6 months
jackson535#1361: like comfort, sound isolation, and durability
jackson535#1361: couldn't they care about other benefits of good headphones or speakers
jackson535#1361: but by extension
DanielGJ44#4557: Audio is literally the bottom of my list when it comes in terms of upgrades personally for whatever reason
jackson535#1361: some people just don't value sound quality
jackson535#1361: i know
jackson535#1361: the bar to entry is as low as the stuff they're already buying
DanielGJ44#4557: Well I mean I literally can't tell the difference between that and iPhone pack-in headphones and I am assuming many people are the same, that's just the point I am trying to make
jackson535#1361: there are $50 earbuds that people who enjoy sound quality swear by
jackson535#1361: it's a really bad example because the hd800 is generally considered a bad product, and it's on the very high end of the spectrum
jackson535#1361: 1k sennheisers is a very common thing to reference to go against good audio
DanielGJ44#4557: Maybe people learned that the markup of audio equipment is well over 100% in most cases, and instead if making it accessible by lowering prices people just stopped giving a damn because they'd never be able to realistically afford and keep up with what is premium
jackson535#1361: and that having a huge cubic machine was a stupid idea
jackson535#1361: and everyone decided that washing dishes by hand with some cool dish soap was awesome and convenient
jackson535#1361: what if all of a sudden everyone forgot about dishwashers
jackson535#1361: it just seems like an entire type of product that everyone has forgotten about
DanielGJ44#4557: But I've tried like $1k Sennheiser and I am literally not in tune enough to tell the difference between the cloud 2 and those
jackson535#1361: you can get an entry level pair of conventional powered speakers for $70-$100
DanielGJ44#4557: For what it's worth I still swear by my HyperX Cloud 2's which have been reliable and fairly good quality, even though they're not "music grade"
jackson535#1361: why not $70 speakers
jackson535#1361: there are people that listen to music on a $2400 computer, $400 monitor, and $10 speakers
jackson535#1361: but like
Verlio_H#0201: fur ari
jackson535#1361: i mean if you're looking for fine detail for the purpose of critiquing and producing music, the speakers should be 1/4 to 1/2 of the setup cost
DanielGJ44#4557: It's like buying a Ferrari to drive 2 blocks to work and back in stop and go, for some people
jackson535#1361: i know
DanielGJ44#4557: Many people don't care about sound quality to the degree you do though so I feel it's relative
jackson535#1361: why do people pay so much for their monitor but rarely give a damn about sound? not even decent headphones!
jackson535#1361: out of all the "gaming setups" i see out there, maybe 10% of them have some sort of cheap computer speakers, and 1-2% of them have speakers that are respectable and are worthy of being in a $3000 gaming setup for someone not producing music
jackson535#1361: on a somewhat related note
jackson535#1361: tbf I've heard the homepod and original airpods, but not the 16" macbook. I've heard other "high end <:bobby_joy:692808284331049040> " laptop speakers though
jackson535#1361: I've gotten $10 audio technica earbuds at ROSS's and they are a lot more detailed than any laptop speakers, maybe even more detailed than the apple homepod or airpods
jackson535#1361: yes
Saltypretzel#0321: m a r k e t i n g
jackson535#1361: why spend $3000 on a computer with the intent of music listening with sound quality and spend 0 on the sound
jackson535#1361: its like comparing one steaming pile of sh%t to another slightly less steaming pile of sh%t
jackson535#1361: couldn't $10 earbuds or a $70 bluetooth speaker be way better
jackson535#1361: is that really a standard of music listening that people accept
jackson535#1361: this was especially true with the 16" macbook speakers
jackson535#1361: who buys a laptop and thinks "yeah I'm gonna do some hifi music listening on my crappy ass laptop speakers"
jackson535#1361: lots of reviewers list the speakers as some big deal feature that you should consider when buying a laptop
jackson535#1361: I don't get the whole thing with laptop speakers
Reese4221#8317: they actually look pretty good

PseudoGoose#2841: Honestly I don't care about any of the things YouTube features or promotes. Its a banner that is not a video that is in the middle of my feed. So it may not technically be an ad, but its an ad in the sense that its unwanted/unneeded clutter.
DustyAngel47#7299: well ***technicallly*** thats not an ad
DustyAngel47#7299: i like the youtube vanced logo lol
DustyAngel47#7299: but you'll get an F anyways because the changes look so bad
PseudoGoose#2841: Oh ok
DustyAngel47#7299: it might be changed
DustyAngel47#7299: no i'm making fun of my own ability to change the homework so that the teacher doesn't know
PseudoGoose#2841: Trying it out.... Yep, a perfect ad blocker with no problems whatsoever
PseudoGoose#2841: Idfk it looks way better at the correct resolution (and also doesn't have that red background on my device, which I admit is pretty ugly)
PseudoGoose#2841: That makes it much worse than it actually looks
DustyAngel47#7299: at least it isnt as bad as this
DustyAngel47#7299: its a hue shifted version of the youtube vanced logo lol
Verlio_H#0201: beutifal

FacePox#2708: both parents must also be zambian in order to run for office
Verlio_H#0201: rip
FacePox#2708: he wanted to run for president but they wouldn't let him because his parents were from Britain and Zambia has very strict requirements about who can run for president.
Verlio_H#0201: he went to the university of sussex
FacePox#2708: he was actually very popular
Verlio_H#0201: their name is Guy so it is funny enough to pass the <#403343343775383552> test

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Using it really is the best way to learn
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's fun to try and learn
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The different types of formality are quite something
PseudoGoose#2841: Yeah there's those but also other parts of the language, a good example is that in english we use "thank you" and maybe variants "thank you very much" and "thanks" depending on the situation, but in Japanese there's several more https://www.nihongomaster.com/blog/thank-you-in-japanese/
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: As a foreigner you'll probably get away with some (accidental) rudeness but that's obviously not good
DustyAngel47#7299: unrelated: why does yandex translator have an `Emoji` option
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yeah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: -chan, -san, -sama, etc etc
PseudoGoose#2841: Honorifics?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Whaddya call em
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The uh
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah I don't know much japanese, but from what I've heard context (especially the relative seniority of the person you're talking to) matters. It's like how we generally use mister to refer to older people but that respect is waaay more deeply ingrained into the language and culture of japan.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: While in English you can easily clarify
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: To be fair to these systems, japanese is extremely dependent on context
DustyAngel47#7299: somehow just en->jp->en screwed it up more in some parts than running it through a bunch of random languages lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I use a combination of all of em to communicate but it's a slow process since I gotta manually check and alter stuff
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: From personal experience‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Deepl is better at that but often misses the point ("seems like there's nobody here" becomes "there's nothing inside")
DustyAngel47#7299: really?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Translate often reccomends you to insult people using en->jp translation
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Let's just say this is not that bad
DustyAngel47#7299: but then i dont
DustyAngel47#7299: i wanna change it
DustyAngel47#7299: 10/10
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: No other word in that sentence implies "past"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Actually it does translate correctly here but it just adds verleden to the end for some reason
DustyAngel47#7299: `Tot de dood ons scheidt en we niet langer in het verleden zijn`
DustyAngel47#7299: deepl works
Saltypretzel#0321: There is also this
DustyAngel47#7299: ah nice it is reproducable
Saltypretzel#0321: Let me find the screen recording

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Ah well if you mix languages yeah it'll mess up
DustyAngel47#7299: 
DustyAngel47#7299: but i guess the mess of translating the sentence has gone through made it just give up?
DustyAngel47#7299: hmm it translates it on its own
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: What about deepl?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Wait translate can't translate that?

PseudoGoose#2841: Unless you can somehow use a range of ranges
PseudoGoose#2841: Completely nonsensical and useless range value, but it is valid syntax
PseudoGoose#2841: It has the type `RangeToInclusive<RangeFull>`
PseudoGoose#2841: `..=(..)`
PseudoGoose#2841: Its a range that is open on the left and with an inclusive bound on the right, the bound is equal to the open range `..`
PseudoGoose#2841: Oh yeah this is weird
PseudoGoose#2841: It looks like a range syntax ..=
PseudoGoose#2841: No its just nonsense. There's nothing like that in array initialization syntax (unless they stabilized `..` for array unpacking which I highly doubt).
DustyAngel47#7299: probably not right
DustyAngel47#7299: uh maybe it is making the value it is contained in equal to the value it is contained in?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: [..=..] looks like a spider to me
PseudoGoose#2841: An array construction of some kind?
PseudoGoose#2841: Ok, what I don't get is how `&[..=..][..]` is a valid expression. What is happening in that first set of braces?

FacePox#2708: https://discord.bots.gg/bots/134073775925886976
Broyojo#2667: technically educational
Broyojo#2667: yes what an amazing equation
FacePox#2708: https://top.gg/bot/134073775925886976/invite/
RyanT#1426: which one?
Verlio_H#0201: has a latex command
Verlio_H#0201: mathbot
RyanT#1426: then whats the bot
RyanT#1426: oh, so its not public
FacePox#2708: It‚Äôs a server with some of my friends from school
RyanT#1426: whats the server?
Verlio_H#0201: = 69420
FacePox#2708: 
FacePox#2708: 
FacePox#2708: This is the first thing that was made
FacePox#2708: A server I‚Äôm in got mathbot
Verlio_H#0201: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: Arguing that the political philosophy and standing of a state is based on whether or not a voter has to turn a page is a whole level of big brain I am not prepared to digest
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Idk, I just remember that was an example of predatory ballots
Broyojo#2667: yes
CrispyPin#1149: print the zip file in base64
CrispyPin#1149: just compress the names
Broyojo#2667: well yeah it is probably space unless the page is like blatantly big enough to put the other party on the same page
Broyojo#2667: oh I see
Stenodyon#8192: no it's not online
Broyojo#2667: can't it just be a big thing you scroll?
Broyojo#2667: but why does an online one need to have pages?
Stenodyon#8192: I've found a sample ballot, granted it's only one example, but the candidates are not grouped by party and they put candidates on a second page because they didn't have room to put all of them on the first one‚Ä¶
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: It's like doing a homework assignment, and than turning it over and being like, there was more.
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: But it's designed to be predatory towards certain canidates
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: It's not exactly hiding
Stenodyon#8192: how is a page turn "hiding" ?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: There's a reason the state is 80% blue, and it's not exclusively because of demographics
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: But in their ballots they list republican canidates behind a page turn or whatever
Stenodyon#8192: how do you do hyperlinks on paper then?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: As far as I know
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: No
Stenodyon#8192: wait cal has online voting?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Even still, it also makes it easier to do what California does on the ballots, and hide canidates of a certain party behind hyperlinks and whatnot
Broyojo#2667: which needs very high reliability and robustness
Broyojo#2667: yeah the web is too unreliable and broken to really work for this sort of thing
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Online is none of that, and foreign enteties(or domestic) can find vulnerabilities or domestic enteties can make it less accessible
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Mail in>online, but nothing compares to in person. In person is mail in, but there aren't a million unused ballots, and you can witness your vote being counted.
Broyojo#2667: I would prefer mail in voting vs online voting just because you know there is going to be an issue with the online one
Broyojo#2667: honestly I would say the method that provides the best user experience, probably mail in
CrispyPin#1149: ~~all the governments are very incometent and bad~~ <[newline]> ~~very bug ridden~~
Broyojo#2667: at least in the US
Broyojo#2667: very bug ridden
Broyojo#2667: yes all the government websites are very incompetent and bad
Stenodyon#8192: online voting is way worse than mail in voting
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: this being a server with more than a few programmers, I think I can safely say mail in votes are no better than online voting
Stefan#5422: nice

Dragon Lord#6944: F# == F++++ == 0x11
RyanT#1426: so F#?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: C+++++++ is bestest
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: C++ is just b-
Verlio_H#0201: or like some equivalent that isn't +=1
Verlio_H#0201: languages without ++ and -- are e
DustyAngel47#7299: i am a python fan vs c++ enjoyer so i dont know those exist
DustyAngel47#7299: fuck thats right
Verlio_H#0201: decrement
DustyAngel47#7299: then what else is `--`?
Verlio_H#0201: *but -- isn't subtracting by 2*
DustyAngel47#7299: because C is two letters after A
DustyAngel47#7299: C's ascii number code subtracted by 2 would be A's number code
Verlio_H#0201: that would be C-=2
Verlio_H#0201: how would C-- be A?
DustyAngel47#7299: true
RyanT#1426: well, C++ is not called E
DustyAngel47#7299: smh
DustyAngel47#7299: not b
DustyAngel47#7299: that would either be A (because you subtract the ascii number twice) or C
RyanT#1426: B more like C-- lol gotem
Verlio_H#0201: B is the bestest programming language
VigilanteHobo#1873: word

PseudoGoose#2841: if this is a legitimate question, the flash drive won't even function like this. A lot of the adapters are special cases for adapting one specific peripheral from one port to another. (for example, connected directly to the flash drive is a USB to PS/2 adapter specifically for keyboards/mice). Not to mention the USB device on the other end looks like a USB to serial which will present itself as a serial device to the PC.
Verlio_H#0201: it makes it faster
Red_3D#3062: lmfao
CrispyPin#1149: i just realised you were referring to the usb stick, not the stick of adapters
Reese4221#8317: this is indeed wieldable
CrispyPin#1149: depends how you wield it
Reese4221#8317: i wonder what this does to the speed of the stick
Red_3D#3062: the worst part is that the start and end are both usb

Verlio_H#0201: especially if the phone screen was 1080p
DustyAngel47#7299: i would bet 90% of people wouldnt notice the difference between 1080p and 4k on a phone screen
DustyAngel47#7299: just keep a lower-res version on the phone and upload the full res one to the cloud (assuming its based on a bigger company that is semi-guaranteed to stay in business, unlike Nextbit)
Verlio_H#0201: only 4k? what is this 2009?
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: gotta have those 4k 120 hz 42 mp videos available offline
DustyAngel47#7299: in fact arguably you need *less* nowadays because pictures are uploaded to the cloud, music and videos/movies are streamed
DustyAngel47#7299: who needs that much space on their phone
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: the game wont even proabbly support older devices
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: also, i think there are phones now with a terabyte of storage, so i dont think its as big a deal
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: basically compressed lower framerate stuff
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: you have the option to go for a smaller file size version
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: smooth high res animations
DustyAngel47#7299: why does a mobile game need that many assets
DustyAngel47#7299: damn thats like 1/4 of my old phones entire storage size
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: one of those high production value games with gigabytes of assets
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: some dragonball game
Verlio_H#0201: I think eating 6 pieces of pizza was probably not the smartest idea

Red_3D#3062: when was the xkcd guy born
RyanT#1426: hmm... what If I make a server where theres a bot that posts XKCDs going #1, #2, #3 etc... and people can do something to speed it up and the goal is for it to post the latest XKCD before XKCD #whatever is posted to the site
Broyojo#2667: yes then lets use it to mine bitcoin faster and not tell anyone
CrispyPin#1149: plot twist they find a way to crack it really cheaply

Deleted User#0000: this is so epic
Deleted User#0000: that feeling when you're having an identity crisis while listening to ||no cock like horse cock||, the super hexagon soundtrack, several of your favorite homestuck songs, terraria calamity mod music, more ||horse cock||, a few communist red army choir songs, a remix of the tetris theme, and squaredance (kitsune^2 album), all on a looped music queue using the power of the Rythm music bot
Deleted User#0000: i've been listening to nothing but (nsfw song) ||"No Cock Like Horse Cock" by Pepper Coyote|| for the past 2-3 days
Deleted User#0000: and then brute forcing an american plug into it
Deleted User#0000: slapping a label on it that says "american outlet"
Deleted User#0000: it's like having a european outlet or something
Deleted User#0000: i guess because i can connect it to real life
Deleted User#0000: i can't imagine myself not knowing that that's not how files work
Deleted User#0000: it's honestly difficult to
Deleted User#0000: it's so weird trying to sympathize with that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: People don't know what "files" are, and don't think about it either
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because they probably had dozens of people renaming file extensions, thinking it would magically change the type
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I am convinced this is also where the "changing file extension might make the file unstable" comes from
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Windows team trying to shield the user from themselves
Deleted User#0000: ``why`
Deleted User#0000:

Deleted User#0000: idk
Deleted User#0000: yeah i know but ugh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Basically whenever the UI looks like modern bloat (which wastes 90% of the screen), you know it's not what you are looking for
Red_3D#3062: But you are probably correct
Red_3D#3062: That depends, where does it change the time format? Everywhere or just in the task bar

Deleted User#0000: what a shitty operating system

DustyAngel47#7299: better save your conversations
DustyAngel47#7299: > Dead as a doorknob in about one month
Ecconia#4929: Hangouts works for me - still
DustyAngel47#7299: would probably be the main one we move to
Dragon Lord#6944: odysee?
DustyAngel47#7299: although I wonder what we would move to
DustyAngel47#7299: might as well save entire channels, and thats probably a ridiculous storage size at 720p
DustyAngel47#7299: still
Dragon Lord#6944: i'd just drop it to 720p before storing it all
DustyAngel47#7299: i'd probably "only" need a terabyte or two to store all the stuff i'd wanna save
DustyAngel47#7299: the archive.org people probably
Dragon Lord#6944: üñêÔ∏è  <[newline]>      üòê
FacePox#2708: Who‚Äôs ready to buy an exabyte sized server to store youtube
Dragon Lord#6944: idk, maybe the cost vs ad revenue is more similar than i would think...
DustyAngel47#7299: might just be misremembering
Dragon Lord#6944: huh...
DustyAngel47#7299: hmm i remember seeing that it didnt really make much of a profit
Dragon Lord#6944: it makes them a huge amount of money tho...
DustyAngel47#7299: but youtube doesnt really make them that much money iirc
Dragon Lord#6944: i'm sure that there would be a HUGE attempt to either keep it up or to store everything
DustyAngel47#7299: i dont think google is that stupid though, before it shuts down it would go read only (possibly for years)
DustyAngel47#7299: although if youtube dies thats an *insane* amount of history dead, because archiving would be a fucking insane undertaking
Dragon Lord#6944: youtube and google search are probably going to be the last two to go (at least of their current products)
DustyAngel47#7299: youtube will have been ejected before then probably
DustyAngel47#7299: true
Dragon Lord#6944: don't ever forget their most important product
Dragon Lord#6944: and adsense
DustyAngel47#7299: of course thats assuming google will ever die
DustyAngel47#7299: I bet in the last days of google, they'll only have google search and android
Dragon Lord#6944: https://ifunny.co/video/hJIt3bAc8?s=cl
DustyAngel47#7299: i mean they cant be making that much money off it
DustyAngel47#7299: inb4 google kills gmail
DustyAngel47#7299: its on death row
Dragon Lord#6944: it was hanged
DustyAngel47#7299: or has it been thrown in googles mass burial pit
DustyAngel47#7299: is hangouts even a thing anymore?
Dragon Lord#6944: props to the person that checks apache request logs religiously enough to use it as a reliable means of contact

Deleted User#0000: but idk
Deleted User#0000: and i know that doesn't make any sense and everyone has things they're into
Deleted User#0000: disguised as a normal one
Deleted User#0000: i feel a lot of guilt for not being a "normal furry" and instead being the "weird fetishy kinky furry" kind of thing
Deleted User#0000: 3. i'm the weird kind of furry
Deleted User#0000: but the majority of furries i know are younger than me and that's kinda alienating
Deleted User#0000: idk maybe this is just me not being in the right communities
Deleted User#0000: 2. i feel like i'm "outgrowing" being a furry
Deleted User#0000: i would spend my entire life savings for dna modification to make myself into an anthro animal
Deleted User#0000: 1. it's not real
Deleted User#0000: so this led me to come up with 3 reasons i hate being a furry
Deleted User#0000: i cannot continue the game further because this jealousy is so overwhelming that i'm just brought to tears and frustration and yeah
Deleted User#0000: let alone just being able to exist while also being a cute latex furry thing
Deleted User#0000: just *existing* would be bliss imo
Deleted User#0000: i don't care if i only live for 6 months before i die and get turned into 2 more latex furries
Deleted User#0000: afaik the latex furries have no responsibilities other than occasionally absorbing the energy from a human/animal
Deleted User#0000: and this might just be my overwhelming laziness and unwillingness to achieve anything but like idk
Deleted User#0000: but noooo the main character's just vibin' going through the game
Deleted User#0000: i don't care! my life goal, while playing the game, IS to be a latex wolf
Deleted User#0000: and it's like "ohh but you lose your brain and everything"
Deleted User#0000: the fuck is wrong with the main character
Deleted User#0000: *not* gonna hug the things immediately
Deleted User#0000: like you're this human and if you touch the latex stuff your dna gets changed and you become latex furry yourself and you're like
Deleted User#0000: but because i get too jealous of the main character / all the latex furries
Deleted User#0000: not because the early puzzles are apparently pretty bullshit rng
Deleted User#0000: and i hated it
Deleted User#0000: that furry transformation game thing
Deleted User#0000: soo i played a bit of the game changed
Dragon Lord#6944: Fair enough. Feel free to DM me anytime! I have usually respond to discord notifications within 12 hours.

Deleted User#0000: i'm having like
Deleted User#0000: this is so sad
Deleted User#0000: no appetite / desire for food and water
Deleted User#0000: i have just been crying and sleeping all day
Deleted User#0000: today has not been a great day for me
Dragon Lord#6944: Honestly, pretty much any intelligent entity that isn't a human would be preferable in a lot of cases. We're not terribly strong, we can't survive really anything unless we have time to plan, and we essentially useless when not in a group. Pair all of that with the fact that we are vicious amongst ourselves and you have a real conundrum of behavioral and physical evolution.
Deleted User#0000: in my brain, me being a human is FAR inferior to the much better possibility of me being an anthropomorphic animal

Broyojo#2667: ```Don't post inappropriate or sexually provocative pictures or comments. Things that seem funny or cool to you right now might not seem so cool years from now ‚Äî or when a teacher, admissions officer, or potential employer sees them. A good rule of thumb is: if you'd feel weird if your grandmother, coach, or best friend's parents saw it, it's probably not a good thing to post. Even if it's on a private page, it could be hacked or copied and forwarded. <[newline]> ```

In general, if you have questions about the trail you're leaving online, don't be afraid to ask a trusted adult. Sure, you might know more about the online world than a lot of adults do, but they have life experience that can help. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Your online identity and reputation are shaped in much the same way as your real-life identity. But when you're online you don't always get a chance to explain your tone or what you mean.

Deleted User#0000: how do i do something like this without some horribly ugly lookup table that doesn't even use the tuple arguments
Deleted User#0000: ok nevermind rust enum bad
Deleted User#0000: i'm making a separate class that contains said enum type and also the file / line number if specified
Deleted User#0000: so i was just like fuck it
Deleted User#0000: and then i eventually gave up because i couldn't figure out how to properly do it without it just overwriting other instances of that enum value
Deleted User#0000: i got used to rust then spent like 3 hours in python just trying to make an enum with just two fields (file name and line number), which could either both be none, or just line  be none, cause it was used to specify where an error happened when parsing a file
Deleted User#0000: i don't know much python

And then you could use the lemons you have collected to power all of your facilities, making you not need to buy electricity, and if it is plentiful enough, you could even sell the electricity. And if you are fortunate enough to live in a rainy location, you wouldn't need to water the lemons much, and live entirely off of the land that you have.

PseudoGoose#2841: i can see the youtube title now: MINING DOGECOIN IN LOGIC WORLD?! <:Flushed:816775085146112019>
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah it would be a waste of electricity to run, but it would be basically a drop in the ocean compared to the overall network power. Plus, my other hobbies like gaming also use energy, so i think it would be comparable ethically.
PseudoGoose#2841: either in software or hardware
PseudoGoose#2841: it would be fun to make my own doge miner, just for the hell of it
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: im sure no one sensible would hold more than 50%
PseudoGoose#2841: well, they can still hold as long as they like :)
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: gets even richer by not being able to find it for a few days
PseudoGoose#2841: actually almost 400k
PseudoGoose#2841: that's like $300k right now
PseudoGoose#2841: so my buddy is writing a program to scan his old drives to try and find it, and he's getting a fraction of it
PseudoGoose#2841: well, we have to find it first
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: imagine selling that drive on ebay
PseudoGoose#2841: sheeeesh
PseudoGoose#2841: they've sunk so much time into trying to find it, he estimates it was about 670,000 doge. "A former tenant paid their rent in dogecoin back in early 2014 and I don't think I ever cashed it in."
PseudoGoose#2841: one of my friend's friends has a wallet with a bunch of doge on one of his old hard drives somewhere
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I was half considering
PseudoGoose#2841: dude
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: tbh
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I shouldve bought in at 1 cent
PseudoGoose#2841: new all time high of 58 cents
PseudoGoose#2841: ha ha get it ||because it's high asf||
PseudoGoose#2841: what the fuck is dogecoin smoking today

PseudoGoose#2841: that's why i'm staying behind it

Dragon Lord#6944: > very unsafe if someone ... tried to sit on it <[newline]> reminds me of this <[newline]> https://ifunny.co/video/KHQVIegZ8?s=u
PseudoGoose#2841: i guess on the safety part, that's a bit of a stretch. it doesn't have to be unsafe to be effective, it just has to be uncomfortable
PseudoGoose#2841: it's real. from what i can tell it was designed in 2008. <[newline]> https://www.boredpanda.com/pay-sit-the-private-bench/?utm_source=duckduckgo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organic <[newline]> and of course, it was a terrible idea that never went to market (i dunno if it was even intended to be sold), and was very unsafe if someone fell asleep on it or if a blind person tried to sit on it.  <[newline]> and then there were also the sensationalist articles like https://www.wired.com/2010/07/pay-sit-bench-keeps-the-poor-standing-the-rich-relaxing/
Dragon Lord#6944: although mainly in the form of Caesar dressing, as of late.
Dragon Lord#6944: yes, first hand
Dragon Lord#6944: A wonderful set of questions, to be sure. I do not think my days of salad dressing up the robe sleeve are over. I haven't washed it yet. <[newline]> I have not learned from this experience, because it was an event outside of my control - namely the dressing packet from the salad kit suddenly yielding to my attempts to open it. I believe the threat to be minimal, but as we have seen today, the least threatening situations are often the most disastrous due to the lack of meaningful preparation.
Jimmy#8080: Very interesting story mr lord, thank you again for doing this interview. I have a quick followup for you if you've still got the time: do you think your days of salad-dressing-up-the-robe-sleeve are over? Have you learned and grown from this experience so as to not repeat it? Or is the risk of salad-dressing-up-the-robe-sleeve still lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce on you when you least expect it?
ieee 802.11ac#6337: > unlikely and stupid <[newline]> my guy have you seen water physics
Dragon Lord#6944: This and many other unlikely and stupid exploits brought to you by dragon lord
Dragon Lord#6944: Couldn't think where best to put this, but it's funny so I decided to put it in memes. Did you guys know that it is possible to make a mess while making a salad? Have you ever gotten so much salad dressing up the sleeve of your robe that walking to the trash can causes you to drip the entire way? I have. The cleanup is not fun.

DustyAngel47#7299: minecraft xbox 360 was my jam
DanielGJ44#4557: I lied, PEGI 16 for symbols and fisting
DustyAngel47#7299: although about the extent of m-rated games i played as a kid was generally just call of duty which isnt really that bad in the grand scheme of things
DustyAngel47#7299: vomit? completely fine <[newline]> blood? *get it away*
DustyAngel47#7299: lmao
DanielGJ44#4557: The opening cutscene is someone vomiting everywhere
DanielGJ44#4557: I think the Brothers in Arms I was playing is PEGI 15+ so lol
PseudoGoose#2841: violence I guess
DustyAngel47#7299: how is TF2 M rated
PseudoGoose#2841: what I find funny is that TF2 is M-rated and I got that shit when I was 13 <[newline]> also watch_dogs which has some sketchy cutscenes
DustyAngel47#7299: heavy agree
DanielGJ44#4557: Me neither
DustyAngel47#7299: wasnt an option
DustyAngel47#7299: we didnt have internet while i was young
DanielGJ44#4557: Age rating is a waste of time and stops no one
PseudoGoose#2841: yeee
DanielGJ44#4557: Plus steam games don't even need an age rating which is pog
PseudoGoose#2841: well everyone knows pc > console anyways so üòè
DanielGJ44#4557: We were just discussing the law/rating in general lol I don't think anyone was actually intending on purchasing anything
PseudoGoose#2841: oh lol
DanielGJ44#4557: Yes let me buy a console exclusive from steam
PseudoGoose#2841: just buy games on steam <:5Head:618699817077440513>  all they do is ask you for your birthday and trust that it's correct. That's about as much as they're liable for, at least here in the US
DanielGJ44#4557: It appears that in states where it isn't law, the ESRB lobbies stores to implement age checking
DustyAngel47#7299: well at least to parents who dont really care about what their kids are playing
DustyAngel47#7299: so still a mostly useless restriction for the demographic they were trying to target
DustyAngel47#7299: true
DanielGJ44#4557: Well if you were with your parents they obviously wouldn't either
DustyAngel47#7299: it may just be bad memory
DustyAngel47#7299: nope, even in gamestops
DanielGJ44#4557: I know online they don't ID you but I was pretty sure that was a provision when the whole sega/nintendo mortal combat debacle happened
DustyAngel47#7299: although it's probably just my state
jackson535#1361: 
DustyAngel47#7299: not in my experience
DanielGJ44#4557: I thought in certain/all states you get ID'd if you try to buy an M rated game
DustyAngel47#7299: same with the esrb
DanielGJ44#4557: Sure, it's there, but it doesn't do anything
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean in Canada a restriction is the equivalent of trying to dry yourself with a face cloth after a shower
DanielGJ44#4557: Interesting
DustyAngel47#7299: cant have the kids seeing blood, now can we
DustyAngel47#7299: lmao according to wikipedia part of canada restricted the first soldier of fortune as a "pornographic film"
DustyAngel47#7299: yea brothers in arms is the gearbox one
DanielGJ44#4557: It crashed for some reason off of the first mission, I think due to GPU overload as I had the frame rate uncapped lol
DanielGJ44#4557: I was playing BiA: Road to Hill 30
DanielGJ44#4557: I believe it's gearbox
DustyAngel47#7299: or was that soldier of fortune
DustyAngel47#7299: wasnt brothers in arms the gearbox one
DanielGJ44#4557: Brothers in Arms is basically Ubisoft Call of Duty
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah you can only have so many ww2 IPs
DustyAngel47#7299: it was one of the big ww2 shooters along with medal of honor and call of duty, with all but call of duty now being effectively dead (and call of duty now not being a ww2 focused shooter)
DustyAngel47#7299: lmao
Stefan#5422: *me imagining Daniel with his multiple brothers in arm playing some nascar* what?
DustyAngel47#7299: indeed it is a game
Stefan#5422: my brain got stuck on the "I've decided to play and stream brothers in arms" part, I never thought that was a game
DanielGJ44#4557: Should be a good meme
DanielGJ44#4557: I've decided to play and stream brothers in arms since I bought it like 5 years ago and have not yet played

DustyAngel47#7299: ~~also strapping it to the controller entirely ruins the idea of the sensor bar~~
DustyAngel47#7299: but would the usb candles even give ir
Red_3D#3062: 11/10 investment
Red_3D#3062: usb candles that connect to your controller

Verlio_H#0201: yeah
PseudoGoose#2841: and yeah, CISC/RISC is more of a spectrum than two separate buckets, but you can try to develop an architecture in that direction
PseudoGoose#2841: instruction count doesn't tell you much, because you might just have a lot of features like SIMD/vectorized coprocessing, floating point, etc.  <[newline]> RISC is more about orthogonality, so your instructions serve specific purposes that can't be accomplished by other instructions, and are basic actions that can't be broken down further.
PseudoGoose#2841: 232 is very reasonable
Verlio_H#0201: isn't there like 232 total instructions
Broyojo#2667: yeah probably not

DustyAngel47#7299: this unironically is the most disgusting looking food thing i've seen in a while (imo)
Verlio_H#0201: I dont think you would achieve any social interactions at that height and therefore would not need pronouns
RyanT#1426: also, what if your NaN'NaN (btw I know its a joke)
Verlio_H#0201: the troubles of being 5'11''

DustyAngel47#7299: i was nicknaming myself back to drake and needed a new bracket joke
Broyojo#2667: and it also lets companies do evil things without you knowing
Broyojo#2667: which inevitably leads to security flaws
Broyojo#2667: yes, when you make stuff closed source you are betting that your developers are better than all the world's developers
Red_3D#3062: what is happening to your nick names
DustyAngel47#7299: thats probably not a good thing in all aspects
DustyAngel47#7299: if a closed source app's developers cant find a bug, but someone externally does
DustyAngel47#7299: well thats both an advantage and a disadvantage
Red_3D#3062: I disagree on the point that closed source software is more secure cuz you cant find bugs as easily

Dragon Lord#6944: thx
Jimmy#8080: good luck :/
Jimmy#8080: mega oof
Dragon Lord#6944: yesterday (two days ago?), i woke up at 11:00 am for classes after ~4 hours of sleep. going to force myself back around to valid sleep schedule this weekend
Reese4221#8317: OOF
Dragon Lord#6944: woke up at ~7:30 pm today :(
Dragon Lord#6944: i have the sleep schedule of a central russian atm
Dragon Lord#6944: 4:21 here
Reese4221#8317: yes suffer
Reese4221#8317: its 3:21AM
Dragon Lord#6944: also a response utterly devoid of punctuation
Reese4221#8317: even in that my over verbosity shines through despite the fact i tried to be more concise and to the point however it would appear i have fallen flat on my face with this attempt and ended up with a over verbose response
Dragon Lord#6944: my responses are decently verbose as well (most of the time), but not quite *that* verbose.
Reese4221#8317: you can see my over verbosity in my responses aswell jimmy just yeets a reaction at the message and i type a whole reply
Reese4221#8317: i like coffee and snakes so i like this analogy
Dragon Lord#6944: <@!617228318537809920> is the java to <@!154964593397989376>'s python
Jimmy#8080: On further reflection I was not verbose enough. Correction: sufficiently negligible atmosphere to make light scattering also negligible
Reese4221#8317: damnit jimmy you beat me to it im too verbose
Jimmy#8080: Minimal atmosphere :P
PseudoGoose#2841: if there's "no atmosphere", then why do they allegedly have to maintain the orbit because of drag? <:thonk_5:829919326798217276> checkmate round earthers
Dragon Lord#6944: either that or they were very committed trolls
Dragon Lord#6944: not very often, but several times
Dragon Lord#6944: i am willing to explain calmly and patiently to those that actually don't understand
Jimmy#8080: How often do you encounter flat earthers?
Dragon Lord#6944: most of them aren't willing to hear it tho
Jimmy#8080: It's a legitimate question, I don't think you should be dismissive of people who aren't familiar with the explanation but are willing to hear it
Dragon Lord#6944: but they don't believe in such things as **THICC** earth
Dragon Lord#6944: they also ask "why can i see something so far away when i can't see the next town over?" <[newline]> well maybe if there weren't a whole ass planet in the way, you could see china from fricking toronto, you absolute bell-end.
MiniStumpy#5653: xDD
Dragon Lord#6944: yee
Jimmy#8080: Definitely my favorite object to spot in the night sky
Jimmy#8080: It's the size of a football field, extremely bright/reflective, and only a couple hundred km from the surface, with no atmosphere to diffuse the light for most of that distance

Dragon Lord#6944: so, you guys know how matlab appdesigner works? it's an ide for matlab gui code. probably the worst ide i've ever had the displeasure of working with, as well as being written specifically for matlab (and probably *in* matlab too based on the look/how default components in matlab gui functions look). <[newline]>  <[newline]> Just found a very unique bug that I can only assume is the internal renderer. if I pause the code, I can hover over variables to get a tooltip that list out the methods of that variable (essentially immutable dictionary entries in python: it shows the keyword and the data associated with it). <[newline]>  <[newline]> one of the variables i was trying to view earlier was 3 entries deep (app.firstLevelValue.secondLevelValue as an example). I could get tool tips on the 'app' part, but nothing showed up for the 'firstLevelValue' one. The *really* weird part (and the reason i thought that this belonged in <#403343343775383552>) is that any time I hover my mouse over the 'secondLevelValue' it makes the windows error noise with no visual indication of why. It is 100% repeatable, even with some code around it being changed between messing around with it. <[newline]>  <[newline]> fukin' matlab, man XD

Jimmy#8080: I really like how the predator-prey societal divide has parallels to but is quite unlike our real-world societal divides (gender, race, sexuality ect). It lets us analyze societal divides in a detached, unbiased way, because we can do the analysis without any of our preconceived opinions about the real-world divides.
Jimmy#8080: Good film
Dragon Lord#6944: man, i love zootopia
DustyAngel47#7299: but mobile
DustyAngel47#7299: I would've just copy-pasted the font from the screenshot
DustyAngel47#7299: guess who put way too much effort into a meme again
DustyAngel47#7299: also find the wording `depending on where you stand on the issue` really funny in this context for no reason
DustyAngel47#7299: would make for a good meme template
DustyAngel47#7299: you can definitely fit anything in there
DustyAngel47#7299: 
Dragon Lord#6944: i am anybody else
Orionater#6345: Sorry I'm in a funny mood right now. Well funny for me not sure about anybody else.

Stenodyon#8192: I guess it crashes on any system that doesn't have enough ram
PseudoGoose#2841: yes, it's specifically crafted to crash discord i believe

Broyojo#2667: maybe inexperienced devs, but I think to be a expert programmer in any language you need to have a lot of general knowledge not just immedietly applicable in your field
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: i once had to deal with someone not knowing what syntax error was

DanielGJ44#4557: I wish I had that many fans
Verlio_H#0201: yeah!
Dragon Lord#6944: they catch the wind like a sail, which slows down the earth. if we lose enough speed, we'll fall into the sun!
Dragon Lord#6944: all the blades spin in the same direction, so they must eat the earth's momentum
PseudoGoose#2841: it's slowing down the earth ü§£
Dragon Lord#6944: i heard a senator say that we'd run out of wind if we kept harvesting it.
Verlio_H#0201: yes
DustyAngel47#7299: the wind just stops

FalsePattern#7777: oh wait nvm, it converts .NET IL code into native code using another tool, no VM here (RIP reflections though)
RyanT#1426: jc has anyone wrote an actual OS using it?
FalsePattern#7777: don't need to worry about native code if the entire OS runs in the .net VM
FalsePattern#7777: there's this cursed library/tool that allows you to write bootable and functional OSes using .NET <[newline]> https://www.gocosmos.org/
RyanT#1426: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ah but that probably won't work due to me not having a soundblaster
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I just use the bin files present
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: actually, maybe I can use zig cc?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: gotta build a cross-compiler
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: not doing that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Let me attempt to run it on real hardware cuz I hate myself
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: oh cool he‚Äôs actually using vga video modes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I think it‚Äôs a very cool thing he made, but indirectly I would also be calling my project a very cool thing. this works here because I think it is, but I won‚Äôt ever call it ‚Äúsuper difficult‚Äù or whatever, because I still feel like I indirectly say that to myself too by saying that
Red_3D#3062: I dont see it like that, the video was interesting and entertaining. The final result was impressive and I enjoyed leaning about it
Red_3D#3062: here is my general rule of thumb: <[newline]> cool stuff I found: <#416276124977332226>, <#631004929762525204>, <#403343343775383552> (whatever has not been used the longest) <[newline]> stuff I made: <#428658408510455810> (if it is really special and on topic maybe <#401255675264761868>)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: really cool, but... I‚Äôve more or less done that, just without the actual tetris implementation, so it kinda feels like saying ‚Äúgood job, me and you!‚Äù
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: in this case: bare bones tetris
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: no, I‚Äôm talking about things other people did, which I want to comment on
Red_3D#3062: wait, are you asking about saying something like "look at this cool thing I once made"?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: how do you guys give out praise about things you have done before? I don‚Äôt like doing it because I indirectly praise myself, which is something I really don‚Äôt like doing
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: also, kinda on-topic
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Hardcore nerds are a great audience, sure, but who's gonna share the video? Not everyone can afford to wait 10 years for it to get reccomended
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because "fitting a small game into 2KB of memory that also happens to be the size of some large QR-code" is just not gonna get any views by anyone other than hardcore nerds
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: You know I get why people name their videos like "fitting an entire game in a QR code" and such
Stefan#5422: glad it appeals to you
Red_3D#3062: 2‚Å¥/10 description
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Now I'm happy I'm not the only one who shares this pain
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Then I saw the description
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I was annoyed at the title
Red_3D#3062: that is really darn impressive

ieee 802.11ac#6337: arch linux installer v2: we got gpt to do it
Broyojo#2667: and your computer does it
Broyojo#2667: instead of knowing commands just type what you want to do
Broyojo#2667: this would make terminals much much easier for non technical people

PseudoGoose#2841: It's highly unlikely that there are members older than 45, and if there are, it's very few
PseudoGoose#2841: I can't really make any argument about inactive members... but the oldest one I know personally is LordDecapo who is either thirties or late twenties, I can't remember exactly <[newline]> And considering the demographics of internet (especially Discord) users, I'd safely bet on my original argument
Broyojo#2667: yeah
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ok that I would agree with
PseudoGoose#2841: At the very least, it's definitely older than the oldest active member
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So K&R style is ~45 years old, give or take a few years
PseudoGoose#2841: I'd go even farther; they are probably older than the _oldest_ member on this server
Broyojo#2667: yeah
ForLoveOfCats#4111: go fmt uses a variant of OTBS right?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I used to write in Allman style but switched to OTBS a few years ago, and now that I'm writing Rust it is OTBS with required braces
Broyojo#2667: lol
Broyojo#2667: and also I am quite biased as I use go fmt
Broyojo#2667: forgot that
Broyojo#2667: oh yeah...
ForLoveOfCats#4111: because K&R formatting still puts the opening brace on its own line for functions
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Also fun fact, K&R formatting is not actually OTBS
Broyojo#2667: yeah I know it is mostly a problem of me not being used to it, but I will say, they still look terrible
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So while you might not like it because you're used to a different style, there are people who were writing in these styles long before most of us were born and who's internal parsers are tuned for their prefered style
Broyojo#2667: yeah that is true
Stefan#5422: Logical fallacies
ForLoveOfCats#4111: To be fair, all listed styles are older than the average age of the members of this server
Stefan#5422: People think they are right
Broyojo#2667: so much wasted space and wasted time parsing (with your eyes)
Broyojo#2667: but yeah why do these horrible coding styles exist
Broyojo#2667: that would work but would be a bottleneck maybe on very very big projects
Broyojo#2667: honestly if they are very strict on formatting just auto format to your liking on your own local copy and then reformat back to what they are forcing you to use when you commit
Broyojo#2667: lol
ForLoveOfCats#4111: From the Linux kernel format guide <[newline]> > First off, I‚Äôd suggest printing out a copy of the GNU coding standards, and NOT read it. Burn them, it‚Äôs a great symbolic gesture.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: And who doesn't love indenting their braces at a separate indentation level from their body?
Stefan#5422: a (b (), c () )
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yup!
Stefan#5422: I
Stefan#5422: 
ForLoveOfCats#4111: https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Formatting.html
Broyojo#2667: lol that is terrible
ForLoveOfCats#4111: And then there is the GNU style ü§¢ ```c <[newline]> if (x < foo (y, z)) <[newline]>   haha = bar[4] + 5; <[newline]> else <[newline]>   { <[newline]>     while (z) <[newline]>       { <[newline]>         haha += foo (z, z); <[newline]>         z--; <[newline]>       } <[newline]>     return ++x + bar (); <[newline]>   } <[newline]> ```
Broyojo#2667: coding styles:```js <[newline]> // OTBS style <[newline]> fib = (n i64) i64 { <[newline]>     if n < 2 { <[newline]>         return 1 <[newline]>     } <[newline]>     return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> // lisp / python style <[newline]> fib = (n i64) i64 <[newline]>     {if n < 2 <[newline]>         {return 1} <[newline]>     return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)} <[newline]>  <[newline]> // bad style <[newline]> fib = (n i64) i64 <[newline]> { <[newline]>     if n < 2 <[newline]>     { <[newline]>         return 1 <[newline]>     } <[newline]>     return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
Saltypretzel#0321: Yeah they did that for bandwidth limitations for old CRTs and NTSC it has an interesting history
Broyojo#2667: yeah
Dragon Lord#6944: i = interlaced
Broyojo#2667: from skimming the wiki article it looks like you draw 1920x540 pixels every frame and you alternate odd or even rows every frame

DanielGJ44#4557: I've changed my hardware since though so I should be ok now

MiniStumpy#5653: You used source or goldsrc?
MiniStumpy#5653: Yeah
DanielGJ44#4557: I played through most of it but I had to stop when graphical glitches made it unplayable
DanielGJ44#4557: Ah I can't watch that fully because I intend to play the game lol
MiniStumpy#5653: Yeah I must make more progress on that HL LP
MiniStumpy#5653: :D
DanielGJ44#4557: Ah I am subbed anyways so I watch all of em
MiniStumpy#5653: aside from me pinging everyone because of my vids that don't have a schedule
MiniStumpy#5653: almost no activity at all
DanielGJ44#4557: Sad!
MiniStumpy#5653: mega dead
MiniStumpy#5653: like
MiniStumpy#5653: well it's also dead
DanielGJ44#4557: I can join it if you want a cool gamer in it then I guess
MiniStumpy#5653: very sadly
DanielGJ44#4557: The progress bar is not advancing, windows 95 style
MiniStumpy#5653: there aren't cool gamers in it
DanielGJ44#4557: I will join it though if there are cool gamers in it
MiniStumpy#5653: And I just realized I haven't made progress on my LP in a LONG time
MiniStumpy#5653: yeah
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah I'm pretty passive about mine and don't really promote it either, other than having a chat command on stream
MiniStumpy#5653: I need to self promote it lmao
MiniStumpy#5653: 9 members excluding bots
MiniStumpy#5653: yeah I have my yt with 57 subs, but I have my discord with only like... wait
DanielGJ44#4557: Jimmy is there
DanielGJ44#4557: 33ish I think
MiniStumpy#5653: how many members
DanielGJ44#4557: But it's a discord lol
DanielGJ44#4557: I wouldn't call it big
MiniStumpy#5653: You have a big discord?
DanielGJ44#4557: Like if you want the stream notification on just turn on channel notifications, I'm not gonna subject everyone to that
DanielGJ44#4557: See, in my server I have a strict no @ ing everyone policy because all of the streamer discords I am in are VERY annoying with that
DustyAngel47#7299: 
DustyAngel47#7299: but still
DustyAngel47#7299: i am cheating with a bot
DustyAngel47#7299: it begins
DustyAngel47#7299: ooh, i have a good idea of how to get pings
PseudoGoose#2841: also some other periodical announcements like the LD Mini Jam game jams
DustyAngel47#7299: noted, seems like a good way to get pings
PseudoGoose#2841: so a bunch of them send "going live" notifications which I don't pay any attention to and are completely silent besides bumping the notification count
PseudoGoose#2841: i collect them for whatever reason
PseudoGoose#2841: livestreamer discord servers
DustyAngel47#7299: how do you get that many pings
DustyAngel47#7299: darn, thats an average of ~10.9 notifications per day by my calculations
PseudoGoose#2841: this is why I don't bother

Stenodyon#8192: yeah I noticed that too
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That‚Äôs not how you write that *at all*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Wtf is this font btw
Red_3D#3062: interesting
Stenodyon#8192: yup
Red_3D#3062: just under a c instead of over a dot
Red_3D#3062: sorta like you can scribble something round over a dot to get a question mark?
Stenodyon#8192: honestly I'm pretty sure you could scribble whatever under the c and french people would still understand it's a cedilla lol
Stenodyon#8192: when I use this letter I don't even think about it but now that I think about it specifically, it looks so weird
Stenodyon#8192: I write it like that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I can‚Äôt remember that ever
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: How does it curl?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Like
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Okay but have you ever needed to write √ß as a foreigner
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But elementary or middle school should be more than doable
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I highly doubt I‚Äôll ever get anywhere near native at this rate
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don‚Äôt think grabbing your phone to copy it from there is quite ideal either
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Nowadays a lot of stuff is digital though, so you won‚Äôt have to worry too much, but You‚Äôll be stuck if you need to write
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Which is something i never realized, nor have I ever seen anyone else mention that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I‚Äôve recently been talking quite a bit with a native speaker and they told me it really helps with memorizing them
Stenodyon#8192: from what I've heard you have to follow a strict order of strokes and if you don't native speakers can tell you did it wrong or something
Red_3D#3062: my handwriting is crappy, I think it would be almost impossible for me to do it lol
Stenodyon#8192: writing sounds really difficult though
Stenodyon#8192: that's so cool
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: No i can‚Äôt write them at all
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yes I can ‚Äúread‚Äù these (like 10/20 out of the reauired 2000)
Stenodyon#8192: Frain here knowing more french than I do
Red_3D#3062: sounds reasonable
Red_3D#3062: ah well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Dunno
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ÈõªÊ∞ó = electricity i think?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Cuz like
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Maybe electric train?
Stenodyon#8192: lmao
Red_3D#3062: french truly is a beautiful language
Red_3D#3062: the top part of the first character looks like a train
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oui oui baguette
Red_3D#3062: well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ÈõªËªä means train iirc

DanielGJ44#4557: I think that the concept of ISO weeks would be interesting to you, since it is slightly different than regular weeks. That is included in the wiki article
DanielGJ44#4557: Wikipedia shows it fully https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
RyanT#1426: ok
DanielGJ44#4557: or 2021-04-18T00h08m30s
DanielGJ44#4557: the time format is less standardized I believe but the general format is either 2021-04-18T00:08.30
RyanT#1426: btw this does not show a standard time format but mentions it??
DanielGJ44#4557: You are correct!
RyanT#1426: I remember hearing somewhere that YYYY-MM-DD was the official Canadian standard for dates
DanielGJ44#4557: Except for the COVID vaccine consent form of my city, which asks for it in the stupid american way. But that is not federally regulated
DanielGJ44#4557: You'd be interested to know <@!350975527324221451> that Canada has fully adopted ISO 8601 and that is the only date you'll see on government forms, websites, and identification cards üôÇ

DanielGJ44#4557: That is the principle behind 8601 and the reason why every mainstream OS names files that way, like pictures for example
Dragon Lord#6944: yyyyymmddhhmm... As far as needed (yes that is 5 y's). I put that kind of a label on my homework files because it sorts them by due soonest if you sort them alphabetically.

DanielGJ44#4557: And I'd imagine probably most jail systems work that way, just in certain places those who are poor just have a better quality of life
DanielGJ44#4557: I think the way the US does it, they make the prisons so bad that it's not an incentive to live there, since so much of the population that frequent the prisons have such a low standard of life that it'd be beneficial to be imprisoned if it were any better
Jimmy#8080: The prison system is very much about rehabilitation rather than punishment, contrary to how most international justice systems work

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Just use what you like using
DustyAngel47#7299: perhaps even a large meme
DustyAngel47#7299: the linux vs windows war is a big meme
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: https://youtu.be/Q8mD2hsxrhQ
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: funny memes haha
jackson535#1361: both daws *support* almost all the functionality that the other does, but its a matter of just how asinine a feature implementation is
jackson535#1361: the discrepancy is when someone doesnt perfectly fit those two definitions, which is almost 100% of everyone
jackson535#1361: there is great and objective reason that someone making country music should choose ableton and someone making dubstep should choose fl studio
jackson535#1361: however, ableton is so good with audio editing, midi and hardware support, audio recording, and menu arrangement, that if you use those features often then try to use fl studio, you will find it absolutely impossible to use.
jackson535#1361: and wipes the floors with ableton in terms of midi editing, audio routing, automation, note editor, pattern sequencing, organization, and workflow choices
jackson535#1361: fl studio has a great reputation for being "the windows DAW" and being surprisingly stable too
jackson535#1361: and since I have no interest in buying a mac, I settle for using FL studio with a windows 10 desktop with updates disabled for maximum stability
jackson535#1361: but since it's not the case, windows and macos are the two realistic choices
jackson535#1361: I could see linux being an incredibly stable and preferred platform for music production if only the major DAWS extended full support to it
jackson535#1361: seeing reaper provide linux support is a great step in the right direction, but they aren't a force to be reckoned with in terms of marketshare and won't be making all the top VST companies or competing daws invest millions to rewrite their plugins for linux
jackson535#1361: then its probably ableton, then fl studio, then logic pro, then studioone
jackson535#1361: usually cubase/nuendo or protools
jackson535#1361: most professionals aren't using reaper though
jackson535#1361: the subjectivity is extremely real and my claims are generic
jackson535#1361: a daw having pros and cons is always a given
jackson535#1361: not really
Jimmy#8080: Kind of bold of you to be making claims about it then ü§î
jackson535#1361: and the interface/layout is very traditional and therefore easy to learn
jackson535#1361: the workflow with audio samples is nicer than fl
jackson535#1361: I don't know all that much about reaper
Jimmy#8080: Can you elaborate about what FL or ableton have that reaper doesn't? Besides default instruments
jackson535#1361: its all extremely subjective
jackson535#1361: every daw has it's strengths and weaknesses
jackson535#1361: reaper may be the best for the people who use reaper's core functions the most
jackson535#1361: but linux is incredibly unsupported in comparison
Jimmy#8080: I've not used FL or ableton, but everybody I've spoken to who has used those and also Reaper says that Reaper is the best & has more features than the other two
jackson535#1361: windows DAW support has been increasing over the past 15 years
jackson535#1361: so musicians are more often than not going with macos regardless of how clean the os actually is
jackson535#1361: but there are a lot of functions that FL or ableton have that reaper wouldnt
jackson535#1361: reaper is really good for its price
jackson535#1361: it is a daw, and it's certainly not useless
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yes, that's the point of my statement lmao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It is rather annoying though when a synth is Windows only which is not the fault of the DAW though. Very annoying however and a valid point
jackson535#1361: reaper supports linux
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've been playing with Reaper (at Jimmy's recommendation) on Linux with good sucess
jackson535#1361: because daws require exact windows 10 or macos functionality
jackson535#1361: and yes, usb devices can obviously work with linux, but not with fl studio or cubase or studioone or ableton
jackson535#1361: "garbage 10"
jackson535#1361: just thought I'd give some insight as to why some people use windows
jackson535#1361: not what I meant
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've used USB audio devices on linux with no issues. Also no-one here is trying to force you to use linux. You brought it up, seemingly only to rant about it. If someone is trying to force you to use linux and you've decided that windows is better for your uses then tell them to fuck off and go about your day. For some of us linux is a significantly better environment for what we do daily, if that is not true for you then continue to use your computer however is most effective for you
jackson535#1361: fatally broken support for common software that requires deep integration with the os and your computer
jackson535#1361: you will never hear sound
jackson535#1361: imagine if you bought speakers that are designed to connect to a usb audio interface
jackson535#1361: forget midi keyboards
jackson535#1361: I could never get so far as to install wine or an emulator, but it is a known issue where common DAW software like fl studio will have unbelievable asio problems when an attempt to virtualbox or wine them is made
jackson535#1361: software support is the real issue
jackson535#1361: just that my experience out of the box with debian linux was enough to give me a panic attack
jackson535#1361: yes I am aware xd
DustyAngel47#7299: and synaptic
DustyAngel47#7299: and discover
DustyAngel47#7299: and gnome software
DustyAngel47#7299: and pop_store
DustyAngel47#7299: may i introduce you to appcenter
jackson535#1361: and if it also let me use the OS without ever using a terminal, I'd switch over
jackson535#1361: I wish linux had support for stuff like that
DustyAngel47#7299: say what you want about macos, but i don't see pc being viable for running x86 apps on ar- oh wait (/s again)
DustyAngel47#7299: say what you want about linux, but I don't see windows being viable for a general use operating system anytime soon /s
jackson535#1361: in this way, macOS is appealing, even if I hate the flow of the interface
jackson535#1361: the software you put on your OS is what really matters
jackson535#1361: say what you want about windows 10, but I don't see linux being viable for a music workstation anytime soon
DustyAngel47#7299: you think its done adding to the queue of files, but then its like `sike` and adds more
DustyAngel47#7299: i dont get how the hell people use gentoo if this is what they sit through on every update
DustyAngel47#7299: but not normal ram for some reason
DustyAngel47#7299: lmao its almost out of swap
DustyAngel47#7299: minecraft server on onecore cpu when
ieee 802.11ac#6337: dude i could run a mc server on an actual 2 core system but i won't because actual systems use a lot of power
DustyAngel47#7299: minecraft server in windows 10 vm running on a dualcore cpu when
DustyAngel47#7299: trust me i've tried, its not worth it
DustyAngel47#7299: at least you arent trying to run a vm with only 2 host cores
ieee 802.11ac#6337: yeah it's nice i can run a vm with 2 cores and still have 4 left over for garbage 10‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
DustyAngel47#7299: hexacore sounds way cooler than octacore as well
ieee 802.11ac#6337: ayyy 6 core gang

DustyAngel47#7299: the mc server might be able to run
DustyAngel47#7299: just most of it
DustyAngel47#7299: ok, it doesnt seem it wants to recompile everything
DustyAngel47#7299: give me a sec
DustyAngel47#7299: says as i go to find the proper options and recompile it
ieee 802.11ac#6337: if you're gonna quit can you get the mc server up
DustyAngel47#7299: no way in hell am i recompiling it
DustyAngel47#7299: i quit
DustyAngel47#7299: time to hope it works
DustyAngel47#7299: it installed
DustyAngel47#7299: alright
DustyAngel47#7299: now to figure out where it put the package
DustyAngel47#7299: it finally finished
DustyAngel47#7299: speak of the devil\
DustyAngel47#7299: its now getting to the point where even old reddit is being slow
DustyAngel47#7299: still going
DustyAngel47#7299: i get that its a big library, but how many things will this have to compile
DustyAngel47#7299: and is now compiling actual tensorflow
DustyAngel47#7299: at least its done compiling llvm
DustyAngel47#7299: ie `etc/XXX.conf` needed to be changed to `/etc/XXX.conf`
DustyAngel47#7299: for some reason it was trying to install configs to a relative path
DustyAngel47#7299: i think the most annoying part *so far* was patching bazel 0.26.1's deb to install
Broyojo#2667: hmm yes
DustyAngel47#7299: compiling tensorflow 1.XX with cpu extentions
Broyojo#2667: I am not caught up on the conversation
Broyojo#2667: what is this again?
DustyAngel47#7299: why
DustyAngel47#7299: take 4*
DustyAngel47#7299: i really want my 5% performance improvement
DustyAngel47#7299: now with an external library patch because 1.xx doesnt have a fix for the newer versions breaking changes
DustyAngel47#7299: because of course it didnt work the second time
DustyAngel47#7299: take 3
DustyAngel47#7299: alright
DustyAngel47#7299: stop finding more things to build
DustyAngel47#7299: well on the bright side i can now use my computer as a footwarmer
DustyAngel47#7299: lol
DustyAngel47#7299: i think
DustyAngel47#7299: it is getting further in the build
DustyAngel47#7299: well after patching the build file for hwloc
DustyAngel47#7299: dammit
DustyAngel47#7299: dont ask why i'm doing this in <#403343343775383552>
DustyAngel47#7299: i will now prepare for my computer to die
DustyAngel47#7299: now to build
DustyAngel47#7299: finally
DustyAngel47#7299: i think i can try and build tensorflow 1.15 now
DustyAngel47#7299: now that i've spent the last 30 minutes trying to patch out a bug in an old deb release of bazel
DustyAngel47#7299: lol
DustyAngel47#7299: i wonder if i compile tensorflow with these if it will be faster ü§î
DustyAngel47#7299: odd
DustyAngel47#7299: i dont remember running into memory issues
DustyAngel47#7299: did i install the gpu version or something?
DustyAngel47#7299: i like how at the end of the generated thing it just randomly went into a wikipedia article

Dragon Lord#6944: just accidentally used a terminal text editor control on google text editor and closed my browser. fml
Broyojo#2667: very ahead of the times
Verlio_H#0201: agreed
FacePox#2708: My brain has been ruined by the internet

Stenodyon#8192: lol
MiniStumpy#5653: me be noob
MiniStumpy#5653: lmao
CrispyPin#1149: it causes a memory leak, which restarts discord if you're on windows
Broyojo#2667: that finds the charging port on the car
Broyojo#2667: that automatic tesla recharger thing
MiniStumpy#5653: uhh idk
MiniStumpy#5653: me
MiniStumpy#5653: You want memes?
Star Twister Play#1123: What the... My discord restart after this
Broyojo#2667: what would goto be
MiniStumpy#5653: *XD
MiniStumpy#5653: xd
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The try catch is very accurate

MiniStumpy#5653: You've just been Mr. Incredibled
FacePox#2708: 
Red_3D#3062: thanks for reminding me to install mpv
FacePox#2708: So it‚Äôs not just a discord thing
FacePox#2708: I played one with the same effect on mpv and my memory usage shot through the roof before going back down because mpv auto closes
Dragon Lord#6944: firefox can't open it (unless i'm doing something wrong)
Dragon Lord#6944: can't find any info on it :/
Dragon Lord#6944: this is true
CrispyPin#1149: but it wont embed then
Dragon Lord#6944: just in case
Dragon Lord#6944: you might want to spoiler that
Dragon Lord#6944: i mean, '%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C' is a bit suspect

Dragon Lord#6944: maybe the file name?
Dragon Lord#6944: must be the renderer then, right?
CrispyPin#1149: with the same results
CrispyPin#1149: it exists as an mp4 too
Reese4221#8317: damn really curious how it borks like that
Dragon Lord#6944: trying to find info on it
Dragon Lord#6944: nope
Reese4221#8317: do you know what exactly is causing it?
Dragon Lord#6944: the mod team on the discord subreddit is trying to censor info on it to prevent missuse
Dragon Lord#6944: looks like a chromium bug
Reese4221#8317: and if i open the gif in something else will that something else also leak
Reese4221#8317: the question now is why does that gif cause a memory leak
Reese4221#8317: yea
Dragon Lord#6944: i'd rather not put people in that position tho
Dragon Lord#6944: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Reese4221#8317: well if their fast enough to leave the channel before it plays no
Reese4221#8317: yes
Dragon Lord#6944: it will get people stuck in a crash loop if I didn't lol
Reese4221#8317: also thank you for spoilering that
Dragon Lord#6944: fart*
Reese4221#8317: oh you little shi-
Dragon Lord#6944: you might say it's... nefario-us
Dragon Lord#6944: fart gun lol
Reese4221#8317: 
Reese4221#8317: it does indeed cause a memory leak
Reese4221#8317: thats a very cruel gif
FacePox#2708: (debian)
FacePox#2708: even on linux for me
FacePox#2708: it causes a memory leak

CrispyPin#1149: interesting

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Except that assembly is often easier to compile than c++
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That would be more accurate if it was assembly
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ~~but hey it‚Äôs c++ so everything is fragile~~
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: My issue with it is that it does the same thing two ways and it looks extremely fragile
Red_3D#3062: wait what
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That‚Äôs not my issue
Buzz#6223: oh god

Red_3D#3062: I love c++
Dragon Lord#6944: (and some gravity gun sound effects)
Dragon Lord#6944: only way they could have made it better is by making the rotations really jerky when it's near the ground and making the gmod hitbox intersection sound
Dragon Lord#6944: that smash sound effect tho

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Or install win7 in a virtual machine, though that sounds like a lot of work
DanielGJ44#4557: I'm sure you can find non malicious copies online depending on your moral view of that
Jimmy#8080: I wish I'd known, I'd have kept backups of those exes when upgrading our old pc from 7 to 10
DanielGJ44#4557: And move them to a machine running 10, I should clarify that bit
DanielGJ44#4557: Or acquire them by other means
DanielGJ44#4557: Upon reading something on Google apparently it's as easy as copying two .exe files from an existing XP/vista/7 install from the system32 directory and running them
Jimmy#8080: hmmm
DanielGJ44#4557: And I know our school computers when converted to windows 10 had the legacy programs on it too
DanielGJ44#4557: I'm pretty sure you can internet archive run it through browser using embedded dosbox
Jimmy#8080: I'm not aware of a way to do so
DanielGJ44#4557: Install the old solitaire for her
DanielGJ44#4557: Sounds garbage
DanielGJ44#4557: Lol
Jimmy#8080: It's full of ads and they insist on keeping track of your "ranking"
Jimmy#8080: Ha, my mom plays windows solitaire a lot, and she's pissed that the manually installed win10 solitaire is vastly inferior to the preinstalled solitaire from xp/vista/7
DanielGJ44#4557: I'm sure it's fun
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~hey, my grandpa plays solitaire collection~~
DanielGJ44#4557: In fact I'm sure I've seen that somewhere lol
DanielGJ44#4557: Although wouldn't surprise me if people also complained about solitaire collection being removed after being a default software too despite no one using it
DanielGJ44#4557: Seems pretty reasonable to remove it if it hasn't been used
DanielGJ44#4557: User installed instances remain and if it had ever been updated I believe it remained
DanielGJ44#4557: What are they supposed to do
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean people make fun of flash being included by default and then ridicule the removal of a default software
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Let's force remove programs from the user's system
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Hmm ah yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It... It what
Stenodyon#8192: <:dab:446109373849141258>
Jimmy#8080: sick interrobang sis
Stenodyon#8192: who wouldn't ‚ÄΩ
DanielGJ44#4557: Hence why you have that exe still
DanielGJ44#4557: Of the default installed component, I believe they still allow you to install it yourself
RyanT#1426: oh
DanielGJ44#4557: You are correct, the windows update forced the removal though
RyanT#1426: that already exists
DanielGJ44#4557: Sad!
DanielGJ44#4557: But I'd imagine new installs that haven't been updated come from an old ISO because they don't update the install material as much
DanielGJ44#4557: One of the updates recently had a flash player removal tool explicitly mentioned
DanielGJ44#4557: Huh
Verlio_H#0201: lol
ieee 802.11ac#6337: in other news, windows 10 still comes with 32 bit flash by default

jackson535#1361: damn
jackson535#1361: oh now it says i didnt listen to enough music
jackson535#1361: I couldnt get that website to work ever
DanielGJ44#4557: And by "advertise" it's only really a chat command at that
Broyojo#2667: amazon will pay people to not do it
DanielGJ44#4557: But if we can do it on a large scale... ü§î
Verlio_H#0201: nothing beter than taking small amounts of money away from large corperations
Verlio_H#0201: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: That's respectable, and the reason I don't actively advertise subbing or donating. If someone wants to support me by that method then it should be by someone's complete own accord and research; I do advertise prime subbing, because that takes money away from Amazon and someone has already paid for that anyways
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Daniel nailed in on the head pretty well. I realized I really don't like the revenue system of people spending 5 bucks to get a sentence read aloud by TTS and ignored by the streamer who is actively doing something else. I would estimate that a good 60% or more of content that I consume is edited VODs and as a result many of my favorite creators are primarily streamers. So I have nothing against those who stream and do well in this regard. Heck if I had disposable income there are a few creators, streamers included, that I would want to support regularly. I just wouldn't feel comfortable with it if I were to somehow find myself on the receiving end of that.
DanielGJ44#4557: Or that Amazon and YouTube are pretty predatory with their revenue cuts, advertising, and content policies
DanielGJ44#4557: Probably an objection to people spending or "donating" money for streaming, I frequently hear that from other streamers
Dragon Lord#6944: thanos snaps
Verlio_H#0201: true
Jimmy#8080: Probably that he didn't want his love of streaming to overshadow his love of cats
Verlio_H#0201: yeah I also want an explaination smh
PseudoGoose#2841: personal moral reasons?
Verlio_H#0201: @everyone haha get pinged, endgame spoilers: <[newline]> || <@!154964593397989376> ||

DanielGJ44#4557: damn it discord showed me jimmy's @ and then changed it last minute
Broyojo#2667: my brain focuses too much on the music and the parts in it
Broyojo#2667: I also cannot listen to music and work
Vrtyewie#9751: This was higher than I thought it was going to be
DanielGJ44#4557: 
Vrtyewie#9751: 
Verlio_H#0201: agreed
Jimmy#8080: These are excellent <#403343343775383552>
DanielGJ44#4557: re: the learning new behaviour. I've always been able to do a task and ramble about anything naturally
DanielGJ44#4557: Interesting. I wish I had the ability to do that
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I discovered something interesting when starting to stream a while back (which I stopped because I realized I *didn't* want to succeed at due to personal moral reasons despite the fact that it *was* quite enjoyable, just had to mention because this is the first I've mentioned streaming since I stopped). I noticed that at first it was extremely difficulty to ramble on about something and do anything meaningful in the game at the same time. However as time passed I got better and better about it. I think that's a similar sort of thing, where the brain has to adapt to the new task of distributing the appropriate levels of attention to each thing.
DanielGJ44#4557: With how my brain works it's just not wired to do music/work at the same time but I'm not going to detract from anyone who does that
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's awesome to be working on something and just take a 30 second jam break when your favorite song hits that one part that's just mmmmmmm üëå
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: jazz rap
Dragon Lord#6944: what kind of stuff does he listen to?
DanielGJ44#4557: I don't really notice it there and don't notice it's gone lol
Jimmy#8080: It was definitely a learned ability for me. When I started working while listening to music I'd get distracted all the time, but now I can literally simultaneously code and sing along to a song I'm listening to with zero impact on my productivity
DanielGJ44#4557: I've turned my radio off and continued driving for an hour without noticing, really not something I think about
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That is one place I do not listen to anything, driving is to big of a task for that
DanielGJ44#4557: In a vehicle it's usually whatever is on and not actively listening
Vrtyewie#9751: It's nice to just listen sometimes though
Verlio_H#0201: if you cant hear the clock or air conditioner/heater then its too loud
DanielGJ44#4557: Need a clear mind. Most likely a side effect of my ADD
Verlio_H#0201: imagine not liking it to be as silemt as posible
DanielGJ44#4557: Just can't do it
DanielGJ44#4557: My reaction to music while working is the same to someone trying to talk to me while I work
Vrtyewie#9751: It definitely distracts me but I listen anyways
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm listening to music right now (while following this discussion and working on classwork)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's probably a learned ability?
DanielGJ44#4557: So that cuts down a lot of my study time, which is most of my time
Verlio_H#0201: yeah I'd just get distracted
DanielGJ44#4557: I know a lot of people listen to music while they work. I am physically incapable of that
DanielGJ44#4557: Me too, more or less
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: his tastes btw
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: my radio is my little brothers speakers
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I mostly stopped
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Can you elaborate on your relationship with music? Music is a very major part of my life (consuming it that is) so I would like to better understand those who do not actively seek to listen to music.
Verlio_H#0201: am I the only one that doesn't listen to music
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: just a few in the top 100, or thousand
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: most people dont even listen to the top ten
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: theres alot of artists, and most dont listen to all the same, so if you exclusively listen to the top 10, than youll be like 1%, but most people listen to alot of smaller artists.
Jimmy#8080: At least, that's if I'm reading the chart right
Jimmy#8080: I find it fascinating that the LEAST common music taste is to be exclusively into the MOST popular music. The majority of folks like some popular stuff, but also a lot of obscure stuff as well.
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I havent listened to spotify for a while
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: 
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: 
PseudoGoose#2841: but there has got to be a better way to present that data
PseudoGoose#2841: ok i get what each ring is of course
PseudoGoose#2841: how am i supposed to read that
PseudoGoose#2841: what the hell is this chart
jackson535#1361: youtube is some sort of cruel joke
jackson535#1361: but spotify is 0.26 cents for me
Dragon Lord#6944: major bruh moment
Dragon Lord#6944: 
jackson535#1361: amazon music is like 0.9 cents per play
jackson535#1361: tidal's roughly 0.6 cents per play
jackson535#1361: outer ring is plays, inner ring is %income
jackson535#1361: spotify pays artists very little per play compared to tidal
PseudoGoose#2841: Regarding smaller artists, that's exactly why I left TIDAL for Spotify, there were several medium-small artists I like (JYOCHO, Frums, Camellia, Sakuraburst, NOMA come to mind) that either had many songs unavailable on TIDAL or weren't listed at all. But you can find a lot more on Spotify, in my experience
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'd love an online-based music player which sourced from multiple services with a fallback order, something like Spotify -> Pandora -> Soundcloud -> Youtube so you would have *all* the music at your fingertips. The difficulty there is not with the services but in getting "auto suggestion playlist"-type functionality in a way that leverages all of those. There are multiple non music streaming services which just do taste categorization and suggestion but still plenty of work that would need to be done
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I say it would be pretty damn good because there is a *lot* of musical content on Youtube which is not available elsewhere: small time artists, random covers, and reuploads of songs that otherwise wouldn't be available at all, ect
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Like come on, I don't want to go put on an album only to have it stop multiples times for the random stuff at the beginning and end of music videos (or god forbid random background noises that some artists like to put in their music videos for the flair)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Youtube Music would unironically be pretty damn good if they just stopped sourcing songs from the music video instead of the official audio versions
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Can we have Spotify? <[newline]> No, we have Spotify at home. <[newline]> Spotify at home: *Youtube Music*
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I would use spotify if I had the disposable income to spend on a premium plan, then I would be able to use one of the various clients
PseudoGoose#2841: i just switched to spotify
PseudoGoose#2841: lol same
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Gah this is the second "music taste summarizer" site that I cannot use because I don't use spotify
PseudoGoose#2841: also this account is not very old
PseudoGoose#2841: i certainly follow more obscure artists than that... maybe i listened to it more or something
PseudoGoose#2841: i'm surprised that they consider 100 gecs to be that obscure
DanielGJ44#4557: My most obscure artist would probably be Kingo Hamada or the guy who did the sims 1 soundtrack, forget his name
DanielGJ44#4557: Interesting

Dragon Lord#6944: i mean, it was a text box. the label said to make sure to add a country code, but it was rejected if i put one in. i had to leave the country code off to get it accepted
Broyojo#2667: and they don't know how to remove the country code in the front of the number so they just force you to put it anyway
Broyojo#2667: yes they are plugging some api that requires country code
Verlio_H#0201: lol
Dragon Lord#6944: fukin web devs XD
Dragon Lord#6944: how tf am i supposed to put in the country code if you only allow 'valid US phone numbers'
Dragon Lord#6944: bruh, i just got a prompt to 'enter your phone number (including country code)' and it threw a hissy fit because i put more than 10 digits.
Verlio_H#0201: true

DanielGJ44#4557: Exactly
Dragon Lord#6944: https://tenor.com/2OjP.gif
DanielGJ44#4557: That's something that's negotiable for me but I prefer just having them all out, especially since I'm not short on screen real estate
DanielGJ44#4557: And I also still don't allow tool menus so all of them clutter the tool menu instead of being grouped
DanielGJ44#4557: I never gave them the time of day afterwards
DanielGJ44#4557: When they first changed to the simplified icons they looked NOTHING like the ones they already had, and it was a common complaint
Dragon Lord#6944: middle and right's alright ~~for fightin'~~
Red_3D#3062: maybe I just hate colored icons, idk
Red_3D#3062: I think the middle and right versions are alright
DanielGJ44#4557: Maybe I could get used to that
DanielGJ44#4557: Wow, they've made the simplified icons look a lot more like the legacy ones
Dragon Lord#6944: I'm so glad I grew up with the left, but fuck the right is better.
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Red_3D#3062: 
DanielGJ44#4557: I think there's a "Windows" colour theme that I use for the window and then I use "Legacy" for icons
DanielGJ44#4557: But that light mode is sightly different from the one I use anyways
DanielGJ44#4557: Looks like they've improved the "simplified" icons since I last saw them though, when they first came out they were all extremely non-descriptive and looked nothing like the predecessor
DanielGJ44#4557: I also don't allow any of the icons to collapse into the same menu either, I don't like having to right click then left click for the one I need
DanielGJ44#4557: Well, that's a matter of opinion
Red_3D#3062: colored icons are even worse
Red_3D#3062: idk, I could not get any work done like this
DanielGJ44#4557: So I just put it back to how it was because everything was more distinct when it had color and wasn't a flat, sightly darker shape
DanielGJ44#4557: Well, mainly for me it was not knowing what tools were what when they oversimplified the logos
Red_3D#3062: thats ugly af
Red_3D#3062: holy crap
DanielGJ44#4557: When I started using it, it was ONLY light mode
Red_3D#3062: it has light mode?
Red_3D#3062: wait what
DanielGJ44#4557: Man, I never got used to GIMP dark mode

RyanT#1426: and here is the #meme!!
RyanT#1426: And Linus Torvalds Wins with a 2 to 0 ratio!!!!
RyanT#1426: well, its supposed to be Linus Land
DustyAngel47#7299: no, its zinus 2an> smh my head
RyanT#1426: its `Linus Land`
DustyAngel47#7299: `ZINUS 2AN>`
RyanT#1426: is this a good addition?
Jimmy#8080: thanks for keeping us in the loop on your meme progress ryan
RyanT#1426: the poll will close at 2:55 AM EST (17 minutes from when I sent this initially) when I will finish the meme (I meant 2:55 lol)
RyanT#1426: also, heres what I have so far
RyanT#1426: and C is not an option
RyanT#1426: you can't vote for both
RyanT#1426: so, who's the coolest Linus <[newline]> A: Linus Sebastian <[newline]> B: Linus Torvalds
RyanT#1426: well, this combines the OG plan and your Idea
DanielGJ44#4557: Or you could face merge the two Linuses (Lini?)
DanielGJ44#4557: That could also work
RyanT#1426: wait... what if the Linus from the Charlie Brown cartoons is "Linus" and then there's "The cooler Linus" and then "The coolest Linus"?
DanielGJ44#4557: Yes I like it
RyanT#1426: so this?
DanielGJ44#4557: Put the Linus from the Charlie Brown cartoons on the left side, that would be funny
RyanT#1426: ok
DanielGJ44#4557: My point being that they are both cooler than the average linus
RyanT#1426: ok
DanielGJ44#4557: I... I understand the joke
RyanT#1426: the whole point is that one of them goes under "Linus" and the other goes under "The cooler Linus"
DanielGJ44#4557: I didn't intend on it but where they both are works
RyanT#1426: is anyone gonna answer?
DanielGJ44#4557: One thing that frustrates me with the general branch "Computer Science" is that it's marketed a lot as becoming a programmer and solely a programmer when in reality it's like 85-95% theory and then the rest being coding to prove that theory
RyanT#1426: now, who should go where?
RyanT#1426: ok
Dragon Lord#6944: nope
RyanT#1426: oh, well did you make anything, like even an X86 bootable "Hello, World!"?
Dragon Lord#6944: well, we learned a lot of different things about operating systems and how to program them (techniques-wise) but we didn't make a full one
RyanT#1426: oh
Dragon Lord#6944: we simulated different schedulers and memory management stuff
RyanT#1426: whats the point in that?
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
Dragon Lord#6944: we learned *about* oses
Dragon Lord#6944: never started

Dragon Lord#6944: yeah, i realized my mistake... i'm REALLY bad with names XD
Dragon Lord#6944: well, gotta learn it somewhere XD
RyanT#1426: anyways, IK that that is LTT linus and not linux linus lol
RyanT#1426: yeah, just didn't know there were OS courses
Dragon Lord#6944: you are aware that I'm 22, right?

FacePox#2708: he's got a point you know
Broyojo#2667: https://youtu.be/bkWx-73wfFU
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Not in Rust and that from what you said Go has the same restriction Rust has
Broyojo#2667: so if you have a foreign package that has this stuff: ```go <[newline]> type Person struct { <[newline]>   Name string <[newline]>   Age  int <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func (p *Person) grow() { <[newline]>   p.Age++ <[newline]> }``` and in your package you have this stuff ```go <[newline]> type Bobby struct { <[newline]>   Age    int <[newline]>   Radius float64 <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func (b *Bobby) grow() { <[newline]>   b.Age++ <[newline]> } <[newline]> ``` you can make a common interface ```go <[newline]> type Entity interface { <[newline]>   grow() float64 <[newline]> }``` this is possible in rust and other languages though
Broyojo#2667: I don't know if I am explaining it that well, kind of getting late lol
Broyojo#2667: well you can't implement new methods on a foreign struct in go, but you can make a custom interface that implicitly implements the foreign struct but won't change the behavior of the foreign struct
ForLoveOfCats#4111: instead it is a specific rule that you cannot impl a foreign trait on a foreign type
ForLoveOfCats#4111: the impl site is completely disconnected from the type declaration site
ForLoveOfCats#4111: you can impl a trait on a type anywhere in the crate which defines that type
ForLoveOfCats#4111: But with Rust this is not a limitation of having to explicitly say that a struct impls a trait
ForLoveOfCats#4111: What you've said so far I knew, but this is something I am not sure of and I would be very happy if it is true
ForLoveOfCats#4111: You can also just write receiver methods on the foreign type and it implicitly impls a foreign interface from another library?
Broyojo#2667: yeah with golang, you can create a new interface that  the foreign struct implicitly implements
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Very annoying
ForLoveOfCats#4111: They would have to wrap it in a struct that they define
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Some downstream consumer of my library would not be able to implement the two required traits on a type they pull in from another crate
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yep, this is a *massive* PITA for data serialization for example (something I've just recently written a lib for)
Broyojo#2667: yeah this is different in golang
ForLoveOfCats#4111: if the trait exists in a different crate then you're screwed
ForLoveOfCats#4111: if the trait definition exists in your crate then you can just implement it like normal
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So that depends
Broyojo#2667: so how in rust would you make a trait and implement it onto a foreign struct?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: <:bobby_ok:692790276623958087>
Broyojo#2667: oh no, I like compile time duck typing like in golang. should have been more clear
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I also misunderstood
ForLoveOfCats#4111: but your wording sounded like you liked duck typing in languages such as is found in Python and Ruby ect
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It can fall under the "compile time duck typing" I was talking about earlier
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Not having to mark a type as impling a trait/interface is not duck typing in the normal sense
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That's still statically typed though <:bobby_thinking:692790276938399835>
Broyojo#2667: so in some vector library you had, they had this data type
Broyojo#2667: In golang, you will make interfaces and these interfaces specify behavior of an object. With an interface, it specifies the minimum required methods an object must have to be that type of the interface. So this is like a standard example that is given: ```go <[newline]> type Shape interface { <[newline]>     Area() float64 <[newline]>     Perim() float64 <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> type Circle struct { <[newline]>     Radius float64 <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func (c Circle) Area() float64 { <[newline]>     return 3.141592653 * c.Radius * c.Radius <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func (c Circle) Perim() float64 { <[newline]>     return 2 * 3.141592653 * c.Radius <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> type Rect struct { <[newline]>     Width, Height float64 <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 { <[newline]>     return r.Width * r.Height <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func (r Rectangle) Perim() float64 { <[newline]>     return 2 * (r.Width + r.Height) <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func printShape(s Shape) { <[newline]>     fmt.Println(s.Area()) <[newline]>      fmt.Println(s.Perim()) <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> func main() { <[newline]>     c := Circle{69420} <[newline]>     r := Rect{69, 420} <[newline]>      printShape(c) <[newline]>      printShape(r) <[newline]> }``` so it helps in saving to implement interfaces with every different type, it is just implicit. Another application of this is when you want to make an interface that external datatypes in other codebases are apart of
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah ~~f~~duck typing
ForLoveOfCats#4111: <@!278221915787624448> So you genuinely prefer duck typing over static typing? That greatly surprises me, would you mind sharing some of your reasons so I can understand your perspective?
DustyAngel47#7299: i will get it right one day
Dragon Lord#6944: ;)
Dragon Lord#6944: recognition*
Dragon Lord#6944: ironically not typed with voice typing ^^
DustyAngel47#7299: yea fuck typing, voice recognistion is where it's at
Broyojo#2667: I think I definitely agree with duck typing, outweighs the cons. I am maybe biased because I use golang a lot but ducktyping makes things very easy
Broyojo#2667: I see that there was some discussion about duck typing
Red_3D#3062: I was about to make it one
Red_3D#3062: ah, it didnt, thats why I deleted my message.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I understand that that can be annoying
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm sorry that it comes across as an argument, I just really love languages and their design so I grasp at any opportunity to wax on about various languages and my experiences with them
Red_3D#3062: I really really like c syntax and have a very hard time accepting anything else
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've written a non-trival amount of Zig on a serious project in the past and with the amount of work they are investing in the compiler toolchain I can wholeheartedly say that while I don't want to use Zig in the near future it is more than worth any initial effort of adapting to the syntax (which really isn't even that weird)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: (I say *mostly* not entirely)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Syntax is surface level, I might have complaints and there might be things about a syntax that I love, but at the end of the day it is mostly unimportant
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've long since learned that I can learn and adapt to any syntax if the language is worth the effort
Red_3D#3062: but your syntax is still strange
Red_3D#3062: well, I am sorry Zig.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: (and various other functional langauges)
Red_3D#3062: oof
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Lazy evaluation? Yeah that would be Haskell not Zig :P
Red_3D#3062: was that haskell?
Red_3D#3062: ohhh
Red_3D#3062: wait, wasnt zig the lang that just kinda did stuff when another part of the code needed it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I think I'm missing the joke lol
Red_3D#3062: isnt that the whole purpose of a computer? /s
Red_3D#3062: imagine not doing the calculations I tell you to do when I tell you to do them
ForLoveOfCats#4111: But *extremely* powerful
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Zig is *weird*
ForLoveOfCats#4111: all in userland code, you could write your own in a library and do the same thing
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Also note that `print` is taking a weird syntax abomination `.{}` which is an anonymous syntax literal, that is literally defining a new type and constructing it in the same location, print then gets the type signature of it at compile time and generates a version of itself that knows how to format the fields as items in the format string or throws a compile error if it cannot figure it out
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Here is some (functional iirc) Zig code that I used to explain this before```c <[newline]> const std = @import("std"); <[newline]> const print = std.debug.print; <[newline]>  <[newline]> fn Wrapper(comptime T: type) type { <[newline]>     return struct { <[newline]>         inner: T, <[newline]>     }; <[newline]> }  <[newline]>  <[newline]> fn make_wrapper(comptime T: type, value: T) Wrapper(T) { <[newline]>     return Wrapper(T) { <[newline]>         .inner = value, <[newline]>     }; <[newline]> } <[newline]>  <[newline]> pub fn main() void { <[newline]>     var wrapper = make_wrapper(i32, -42); <[newline]>     print("value: {}\n", .{wrapper.inner}); //Prints `value: -42` <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```Shitty syntax highlighting because Discord still doesn't support Zig
Red_3D#3062: wait, no? I think that sounds like there are some differences
Red_3D#3062: wait, isnt that also what C++ does?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Zig is an example of attempting to use this in a more flexable way, you can generate types and versions of method by running code at compile time which "evaluates to" the expected type/method/ect and then the compiler checks *that*
Dragon Lord#6944: and it's very useful
Red_3D#3062: but it sure does look cool
Red_3D#3062: yee, thats a pain
ForLoveOfCats#4111: where you *can* shove any type into there (or really anything depending on the template) and you won't get an error until the compiler has figured out what the expanded code would look like and then you get absolutely shit errors 5 template expansions deep because one line in a template used by a template used by a template used by a template used by a template you used doesn't like one of your parameters
Dragon Lord#6944: but the pros outweigh the cons, and you can mitigate any issues by being careful ;)
Dragon Lord#6944: this is a valid concern i suppose...
ForLoveOfCats#4111: C++ templates without any constraints are an example of this
ForLoveOfCats#4111: This taps in the the discussion of *compile time duck typing*
Jimmy#8080: That feels kind of wrong to me, like it's too easy to pass something to the method that doesn't work like you expect it to
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
Red_3D#3062: and you can even brag about doing "metaprogramming" (+5 xp)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That is what the type constraint in the Rust version is for, so that the type has to support addition with itself to be valid for the signature. The C++ version also does that with it's own C++.... flair
Dragon Lord#6944: yes, most languages do this if you define your own type
Dragon Lord#6944: you can even template a function to have more than one type as the variable types
Jimmy#8080: in C# (only language I'm solidly familiar with) you'd have to make a base class or interface that defines a + operator / addition method
Jimmy#8080: that does sound useful
Dragon Lord#6944: for example, this could be rewritten as: <[newline]> ```cpp <[newline]> template <typename T> <[newline]> static T Add(T a, T b) => a + b <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> (assuming that the '+' operator is defined for the type of a and b)
Red_3D#3062: and the extra safety checks can be very important if you dont want your code to die
Dragon Lord#6944: templates are VERY important for not having to rewrite funcitons if you want to make a library
Red_3D#3062: well, templates in C++ are very very useful for all kinds of stuff
Dragon Lord#6944: aha! more words stolen for the boogaloo collective! <[newline]> <\Electric Boogaloo>
Jimmy#8080: My answer to that would be, present me with a realistic scenario in which you'd want/have to do that kind of thing. These kind of arbitrary coding exercises don't have much relation to real-world code usability
Dragon Lord#6944: then you have to define how to add it and template the function.
Jimmy#8080: Lol you too
Red_3D#3062: have a great day
Red_3D#3062: ok, I will leave you alone
Red_3D#3062: what if I wanna use it with a custom datatype
Jimmy#8080: separate overload method for each type
Jimmy#8080: this is how I'd do it: <[newline]> ```csharp <[newline]> static int Add(int a, int b) <[newline]>     => a + b; <[newline]>  <[newline]> static uint Add(uint a, uint b) <[newline]>     => a + b; <[newline]>  <[newline]> static long Add(long a, long b) <[newline]>     => a + b; <[newline]>  <[newline]> static ulong Add(ulong a, ulong b) <[newline]>     => a + b; <[newline]> ```
Jimmy#8080: hold on
Red_3D#3062: Jimmy, can you bless us with a safe C# version?
RyanT#1426: ok
Jimmy#8080: You should really only use `dynamic` when you absolutely have to
Jimmy#8080: This is generally considered messy and not a good idea, plus you get a performance hit
Red_3D#3062: I love you ryan
Red_3D#3062: LMFAO
RyanT#1426: well, then stop being an idiot
Red_3D#3062: like an overflow or something
PseudoGoose#2841: Rust version which is superior to the C++ version <[newline]> ```rust <[newline]> #[must_use] <[newline]> fn add<T: Add<U>, U>(a: T, b: U) -> <T as Add<U>>::Output { <[newline]>     a + b <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
Red_3D#3062: but what if the addition itself fails
Red_3D#3062: is that caught by Add<T>?
Red_3D#3062: what if T does not support addition
Red_3D#3062: but again
Red_3D#3062: that looks safer
RyanT#1426: hmm... looked online and apparently in .NET 4 you can do this <[newline]> ```csharp <[newline]> public static T Add<T>(T number1, T number2) <[newline]> { <[newline]>     dynamic a = number1; <[newline]>     dynamic b = number2; <[newline]>     return a + b; <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
Red_3D#3062: is that a c# thing?
Red_3D#3062: what if the object cant be initialized without arguments
Red_3D#3062: I think its not
Red_3D#3062: and I dont know enough C# to tell if that is safe or not
Red_3D#3062: that got real messy real quick
RyanT#1426: fixed
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Red_3D#3062: what if 0 is an unsupported initialization argument for the target object
Red_3D#3062: nahh
RyanT#1426: fixed again
Red_3D#3062: ok
Broyojo#2667: I will say that haskell generics syntax is much better than the C++ or Rust solutions
DustyAngel47#7299: because i sure will
DustyAngel47#7299: do you want me to make my own arithmatic library for this joke
Red_3D#3062: try again
Red_3D#3062: not safe enough
Red_3D#3062: what if addition is not supported by the object type
Red_3D#3062: what if it errors out
Red_3D#3062: idk dude
RyanT#1426: fixed
Red_3D#3062: stop
Red_3D#3062: dude
Red_3D#3062: INT
DustyAngel47#7299: Python version: <[newline]> ```python <[newline]> def Add(a,b): <[newline]>   return int(a)+int(b)```
Broyojo#2667: yeah that one is generic
Red_3D#3062: not the c++ version. thats the one we are talking about
RyanT#1426: this uses ints too
Red_3D#3062: what if I wanna use something other than an int
Red_3D#3062: I dont trust that
RyanT#1426: C# version <[newline]> ```csharp <[newline]> static object Add(object a, object b) <[newline]> { <[newline]>     try <[newline]>     { <[newline]>         return a + b; <[newline]>     } <[newline]>     catch <[newline]>     { <[newline]>         return new object(); <[newline]>     } <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
Broyojo#2667: where a has an instance of the Num type class (that is why there is a type restriction Num a)
Broyojo#2667: it can add together Num's and returns a Num
Broyojo#2667: has the signature of (+) :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a
Broyojo#2667: (+) is an infix function, so 5 + 4 is the same as (+) 5 4
ForLoveOfCats#4111: is that actually a function (as in called like functions normally are) or a custom infix operator?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I am interested in the Haskell version though
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Rust version which is equivalent to the C++ version```rs <[newline]> #[must_use] <[newline]> fn add<T: std::ops::Add<Output = T>>(a: T, b: T) -> T { <[newline]>     a + b <[newline]> }```
Broyojo#2667: yeah
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Those aren't quite comparable to the C++ version, and neither is the C version
Red_3D#3062: oh, you could totally #define Add(x.y) x+y
Broyojo#2667: lisp: (defn Add (a b) (+ a b)) <[newline]> haskell: Add = (+)

Verlio_H#0201: in nc anyone over the age of 18 or something can get a vacinne now iirc
DanielGJ44#4557: Imagine having people under the age of 75 being able to get vaccines, couldn't be Canada

Dragon Lord#6944: nice
CrispyPin#1149: same thing in my "server room"
Dragon Lord#6944: the door won't close because there are wires in the way
Broyojo#2667: I mean there are stickers that say server and the "servers" are on racks so it qualifies
Nik#1011: I don't expect anything less from this community
Nik#1011: well
Nik#1011: omg
Broyojo#2667: yes lol
Broyojo#2667: I have been using them for like 2 years now and my computer has never gotten loud at all
Dragon Lord#6944: My 'server rack' in case I haven't shown it. Thought you might get a laugh out of it.
PseudoGoose#2841: basically, nh-l9a
Broyojo#2667: very very quiet
PseudoGoose#2841: it's a very custom setup, can't use SFX power supplies for example
Broyojo#2667: I would like to interject and say how awesome noctua nfa-12x25 are
PseudoGoose#2841: not prebuilt, but the guy that makes them does do builds. it's the skyreach 4 mini <[newline]> https://nfc-systems.com/skyreach-4-mini
Nik#1011: do I see a noctua l9i?
Nik#1011: good
Nik#1011: smaller
Nik#1011: fewer fans
Nik#1011: ahh neat
PseudoGoose#2841: also, my case is basically a passive heatsink for the AC-DC power supply (hence the WARNING Hot Surface sticker)
Nik#1011: I don't recognize it at all
Nik#1011: yeah is that a pre-built?
PseudoGoose#2841: but I totally get it, going this small is pretty extreme
PseudoGoose#2841: but that's not necessarily true, like there's a gap between my desk and the wall that where I can't place the case, but it's enough for ventilation
Dragon Lord#6944: did i show you guys my 'server rack'? it's a bit of a meme
PseudoGoose#2841: well, perhaps
Red_3D#3062: my next build will be
Nik#1011: for some reason I don't like smallformfactor cases that require ventilation on all sides. I think it bothers me that you can't put objects right next to it so it isn't functionally as small as it seems like it is
Red_3D#3062: I wish I did
PseudoGoose#2841: (except kinda hard to build in)
Dragon Lord#6944: all my homies use server racks
Nik#1011: damn that's nice looking
PseudoGoose#2841: no regerts
Broyojo#2667: true
PseudoGoose#2841: Go SFF! You'll never go back :D
Broyojo#2667: mine is a dark base 700
Broyojo#2667: yeah mid towers are nice
Nik#1011: why the fuck did I get such a big case
Red_3D#3062: exactly my issue
Nik#1011: see how stupid this looks?

Red_3D#3062: hmm
Nik#1011: it's basically a pantry with a door
Nik#1011: it was so uselessly big that I literally kept food in it
Red_3D#3062: that looks... interesting
Nik#1011: too big
Nik#1011: 
Nik#1011: 760t
Nik#1011: wrong number
Nik#1011: no
Nik#1011: hey my last case was a corsair 780ti I think
Red_3D#3062: I regret it
Red_3D#3062: buying a full atx tower was a mistake
Nik#1011: 
PseudoGoose#2841: lol "small" is the new average i think
Red_3D#3062: alright
CrispyPin#1149: default cooler gang
Nik#1011: the not-full-ATX size
Nik#1011: uhh
Nik#1011: my case is pretty small
Red_3D#3062: whats the form factor
CrispyPin#1149: √∂p√∂
Red_3D#3062: or is your case tiny?
Red_3D#3062: lol

Nik#1011: this guy must be shitting vantablack
Red_3D#3062: lmfao
Nik#1011: if I eat like 10, my poop turns black
Nik#1011: I find it almost scary
Red_3D#3062: I dont think thats healthy but if it helps
Nik#1011: a significant proportion
Nik#1011: quite a few cookies
Nik#1011: yes
Red_3D#3062: well
Red_3D#3062: oh
Nik#1011: for lunch
Nik#1011: just eating this
Nik#1011: 
Nik#1011: like
Red_3D#3062: understandable, they are pretty good
Nik#1011: recently I learned this same friends sometimes eats an entire pack of oreos
Red_3D#3062: that would be pretty awesome
Nik#1011: they plan to soon, I was talking to them about buying SSDs to make the best computers a little better and reselling them to make up the cost of the SSD
Nik#1011: lots have missing drives or batteries or etc
Red_3D#3062: lol, do they pick out the good parts and combine them into new computers
Nik#1011: or like technically functional but quite pathetic
Nik#1011: most of them non-usable
Nik#1011: literally 20 computers
Nik#1011: and they have like
Nik#1011: one of my friends keeps getting old dead or bad computers from friends and family and family workplaces and school and etc
Nik#1011: poggers!
Red_3D#3062: pog!
Nik#1011: 32gb 3600mhz :3

DanielGJ44#4557: So, of 1.2k hours of watchtime, only 49 have counted
Red_3D#3062: alright
DanielGJ44#4557: Shorts watch time does not count towards monetization, so I need to get watch time up
DanielGJ44#4557: Well I've always been mixing in a few regular videos, but I will put more effort into not shorts
Red_3D#3062: does that mean 16:9 will be coming back?
DanielGJ44#4557: I anticipate I will stop doing them entirely
DanielGJ44#4557: Well it's kinda cooling down now, YouTube is nerfing shorts so they are less easy to gain a following from. I was lucky that I did my own research and got in before it blew up.
Red_3D#3062: well, I still dont like taking 16:9 and squishing it into 9:16 but if it yt is this crazy
DanielGJ44#4557: so still clearly a large amount are viewing on mobile lmao
DanielGJ44#4557: Using Shorts greatly skews it; but people on PC aren't shown the shorts unless they are subbed
Red_3D#3062: 99.3 % darn
DanielGJ44#4557: yes
Red_3D#3062: are those actually the numbers
DanielGJ44#4557: apparently people watch my videos on game console which is... bruh
Red_3D#3062: holy crap
DanielGJ44#4557: 
DanielGJ44#4557: also, a majority of people watch youtube on mobile so I'd argue 16:9 vertical is more standard
DanielGJ44#4557: living in the future I guess
Red_3D#3062: huh, interesting

Red_3D#3062: I agree

Verlio_H#0201: I mean I guess april 20th (4/20) is the "International day for cannabis-related protests and events"
DanielGJ44#4557: I'd say so
Verlio_H#0201: was it?
DanielGJ44#4557: Canada announced that the marijuana would be legal on 4/20, that was pretty funny
Verlio_H#0201: 4/20/21 better date
DanielGJ44#4557: I dont think that's true but it would be funny if so
DanielGJ44#4557: Last time it was discussed someone said it was going to be 6-9-21 for the meme
Red_3D#3062: there is a leading theory?
DanielGJ44#4557: I thought the leading theory was 2021-06-09
Verlio_H#0201: daniel covering up the fact that he knows it will be released on april 1st
DanielGJ44#4557: So maybe a Logic World Thursday
DanielGJ44#4557: It falls on a Thursday
Verlio_H#0201: lw release
Broyojo#2667: you think
Broyojo#2667: what is going to be the april fools for lw this year
Red_3D#3062: oh darn, it is

FacePox#2708: WHAT
PseudoGoose#2841: Yes
FacePox#2708: what
PseudoGoose#2841: a purely perspective render doesn't actually look that bad, as long as the nearest/furthest vertices still line up. See ^
FacePox#2708: the pfp

Red_3D#3062: lmfao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: My pfp if it was the Unity logo lmao
Stefan#5422: yes but you managed to get rid of the thiccnes difference
Dragon Lord#6944: i like the shading on that one
Verlio_H#0201: thic
Dragon Lord#6944: maybe you could swap the vertical and horizontal lines for narrow triangles
Red_3D#3062: maybe too thicc now
Red_3D#3062: V3
PseudoGoose#2841: ok
PseudoGoose#2841: ahhhh
Stefan#5422: that is what I was talking about
ForLoveOfCats#4111: The line on the top of the blue looks thicker than the line on the bottom of the green
Stefan#5422: ^
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Also separately it looks like the lines are bigger when closer to the camera
Red_3D#3062: ah, I know why they are how they are
ForLoveOfCats#4111: This is an area that was difficult when making the original image as the angled lines would always feel thicker than the straight up/down/left/right lines and I can see that happening here as well which is fascinating
Stefan#5422: well you can use a shader to get the edges and multiply by the distance from the camera
Stefan#5422: basically make impossible geometry
Red_3D#3062: do you have the slightest idea how difficult it is to make good outlines
Stefan#5422: you need to get them to be the same thiccnes somehow
Stefan#5422: also the edges are inconsistent
Red_3D#3062: well, its what its was supposed to be
Stefan#5422: your perspectve is of by a bit
Red_3D#3062: its just not right
Red_3D#3062: V2, still strange
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Not as visually interesting
Stefan#5422: just animate in ortho
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I was actually just now attempting to make an animation where you see the image and then it starts rotating showing the shape but I realized that I wouldn't be able to very well transition between ortho and perspective
Stefan#5422: darker blacks
Stefan#5422: also no bezels
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Mr blender expert
Stefan#5422: the edged
MiniStumpy#5653: Lmao gn
Red_3D#3062: the lines are too thin
Red_3D#3062: something about this doesnt feel very floc
Stefan#5422: nice
DustyAngel47#7299: confirmed, i swap by will and not by force
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: One row of pixels per day
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Slowly change
Stefan#5422: else keep it
Stefan#5422: Just change it if you want to
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But only since around the end of 2017 iirc
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well, I say I have used this pfp since forever
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Drake can too
Stefan#5422: Am I the only one who willingly can swap
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Man I love this pfp, every few years something like this happens and it is so funny
Verlio_H#0201: rip
DustyAngel47#7299: thanks
DustyAngel47#7299: i just saw how its a cube and not a hexagram, and now i can not unsee it
Stefan#5422: 
ForLoveOfCats#4111: also btw this is <#403343343775383552> lmao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ooooooh that gives me an idea
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <:bobby_ok:692790276623958087>
Verlio_H#0201: 
Stefan#5422: well you could render it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I could never move away from it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Then my personal branding has succeed
Red_3D#3062: ForLoveOfCubes amiright
Stefan#5422: I mean I also like the m√∂bius gears from above
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It screams FLOC
Verlio_H#0201: oh I see it now
ForLoveOfCats#4111: By rendered I mean drawn in paint with the line tool and then retouched at the pixel level because paint sucks
Stefan#5422: well I like it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It is a cube with two missing faces and "rendered" from an orthographic perspective
Stefan#5422: is it just a confusing cube
ForLoveOfCats#4111: For the record that was intentional when I made it
Red_3D#3062: pog
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Bingo Red
Stefan#5422: I mean i can see all the shapes and a 2d shape
Red_3D#3062: I'd say top face and right face missing
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh god no
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Oh yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Why'd you say that
Stefan#5422: Is it not just a 2d shape
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh no
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've gotten a fair number of DMs over the years of people trying to figure out the perspective lmao
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Has the benefit of being "my pfp" that way, I guess
Stefan#5422: Yours does the job
Verlio_H#0201: plane
Stefan#5422: I wish you the best of luck
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Imagine not having an entirely custom avatar picture you drew at age 12 with MS Paint /s
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Might have to actually draw it myself though, ugh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: This one's kinda... Washed out?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: One with a bit more color
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And also
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: One that doesn't radiate white
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Just a slightly different image
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Exactly why I'll keep the same character
Stefan#5422: I just think oh its frain
Stefan#5422: For you I have the issue of actually assosiating you with that character now
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Same character, different picture
Verlio_H#0201: imagine changing your pfp
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But it might be good to change it soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è (was already planning to)
Stefan#5422: well I change it every so often so people dont associate me with the picture
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: As I've had it for *years*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't really notice issues with my pfp
Stefan#5422: I spent 5 mins slapping on a santa hat
Broyojo#2667: yeah both sort of purple pink ish
Stefan#5422: Well yeah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I guess both are "generic anime girl pfp"
Stefan#5422: I mean haircolor I guess
Stefan#5422: I dont think so
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's not *that* similar is it?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Depends on the program iirc, stuff like msvc uses forward slash but a lot of programs (especially those from unix-y backgrounds) use dash on all platforms
Broyojo#2667: and similar icon
Broyojo#2667: well at least same color
Broyojo#2667: your icon and name looks the same lol
Broyojo#2667: both of you guys always confuse me <@!256359653124997120> <@!319035388868034560>
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Powershell 7
Stefan#5422: you what
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But I use powershell
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: When doing cd I use /
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Hmm
Stefan#5422: you can use both i think
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: They already commit crimes by ignoring spaces
DustyAngel47#7299: does windows still use `/` for command line args?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: On file explorer
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Replace \ with /
Stefan#5422: If it wasnt for school I might consider it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Or just like
Stefan#5422: ^
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Won't switch to linux anytime soon, but I'm not an elitist
DustyAngel47#7299: windows on the linux kernel when <[newline]> they can finally have forwards slash paths
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I use wsl quite often
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well honestly I'm happy I'm not a hardcore windows fan
Stefan#5422: Its one of my two regrets
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Gotta manually replace that stuff
Stefan#5422: I hate the fact that I grew up with windows
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That doesn't work
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Cuz
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you can't just copy-paste paths into your code
Verlio_H#0201: I think everyone hates that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Backwards slash filepaths
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: There's one thing I absolutely hate about windows though
Verlio_H#0201: lol yeah windows users think everything else is so weird
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And everything is "in the wrong place"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Everything on a mac is so foreign
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Like macs
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well it's kinda true that windows users don't know how to use certain computers
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: What's a right mouse button
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Lmao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Mac users don't know how to use a mouse /s
Verlio_H#0201: all windows users have no idea how to use a computer
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I couldn't remember a better one about windows users, sorry
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Like how all linux users are extremely obese, how all windows users get viruses constantly, how mac users are entitled rich kids, etc
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I feel like this is the meme-y kinda shitting though
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I recognize that this is <#403343343775383552> but I think that is unnecessary elitism. A lot of stuff produced by those communities is rather poor and causes a fair amount of issues but that doesn't make them bad people. Taking people who are just trying to build stuff and treating them like garbage and constantly shitting on them is not going to change the type of stuff they are producing.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Exactly the point
Red_3D#3062: > they are the embodiment of everything wrong. <[newline]> wise words
RyanT#1426: you do realize you said that in a program written by one
Dragon Lord#6944: They aren't everything wrong, but they are the *embodiment* of everything wrong.

DanielGJ44#4557: in fact our outdoor ones do latch, somehow
DanielGJ44#4557: I dunno I mean canada theoretically has the same sockets as the US but I like never have that issue here
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The plugs are very good at sitting in the socket
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That might be an issue here
Verlio_H#0201: yeah true
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That's true
Verlio_H#0201: the worst plugs are the ones on the plane and that is a fact
DanielGJ44#4557: But I'd prefer the wire break away from the wall than potentially damage the appliance
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If I kicked a wire it would just go in further
PseudoGoose#2841: haven't watched the whole video but he demonstrates it in the first minute or so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h_r2bD5bMs
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean generally for me I need to like literally kick a wire pretty hard on purpose for it to come out
Verlio_H#0201: I haven't been in an area with european plugs for a long enough period of time to really have to use them
Verlio_H#0201: also happens more with the 2 sticky out things plugs than with the 3
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I couldn't have dreamt of receptacles falling out of sockets, that'd require some seriously weird or broken plug to happen
Verlio_H#0201: kind of depends on the socket, some are more fally outy than others
DanielGJ44#4557: but I don't have an issue with anything falling out of a socket here
DanielGJ44#4557: can confirm re: UK
Verlio_H#0201: and in the uk everything is just a pain in the ass to plugin
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Like over here
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: These are things you never really think about when they're done right
DanielGJ44#4557: I have never once had that issue

Verlio_H#0201: ~~everything is just a pain in the ass to plug in or constantly falls out~~
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Interesting
PseudoGoose#2841: well, I jest but yes, we don't have interlocking plugs + receptacles
Verlio_H#0201: the universal plugs on the airplanes dont have holes <[newline]> checkmate aethiest
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Really?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: W-what
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I can't recall ever using a plug socket which didn't have this, but they aren't very memorable, so I might have
PseudoGoose#2841: stuff like this we would consider "industrial" grade in the US
Verlio_H#0201: me when holes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Just from the other side
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The same idea as the the plastic shielding
PseudoGoose#2841: woah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: They're holes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I shall now introduce the next safety feature that many holes have
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: However
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Some do indeed not have this
PseudoGoose#2841: Assuming the plugs aren't cheap ones
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: There's plastic shielding in a way that the metal is not connected to "the wall" while you can still touch it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Nothing will happen
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If you insert a penny between the prongs here
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well you see
Verlio_H#0201: well dont like american plugs have lower voltage than european plugs or something
Verlio_H#0201: rip
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: UK is not part of europe, you heard it here folks
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Reasons why the european plug is good
Verlio_H#0201: I still remember the time I got pushed into the sandbox and fell on tummy then could breath for a few seconds that was e
DanielGJ44#4557: big oof
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah, in my situation I tried coughing but I couldn't, the bronchioles were fully blocked and couldn't bring in/push air
Saltypretzel#0321: It‚Äôs a poor idea to burn sugar dust https://youtu.be/Jg7mLSG-Yws
Verlio_H#0201: generally what follows is coffing and shit
DanielGJ44#4557: I already had existing lung damage and scar tissue that probably didn't help, in addition to the ingestion via the mouth
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean at least the nose would slightly filter it out
Saltypretzel#0321: Dumb kids snort smarties because they think they will get  smart

DanielGJ44#4557: like not being able to breathe for a minute and a half is fucking oof
Saltypretzel#0321: Dumb kids snort them
DanielGJ44#4557: I've nearly choked to death aspirating dust from a chalky candy (I think americans call them smarties) while chewing, that was scary
Verlio_H#0201: just watched that video about the tiktoker who drank 2 bottles of benadryl
DanielGJ44#4557: OK we were going the same place there
DanielGJ44#4557: same reason you don't do the cinnamon challenge
Saltypretzel#0321: Don‚Äôt eat spoonful of cinnamon you can cough and breath in the dust and then you would die
DanielGJ44#4557: that would be the aspiration of a tiny dust

Red_3D#3062: not technically a breakup ~~if you believe that love  *is immortal* transcends death~~ because that is the act of actively stopping a relationship by talking to your partner.

DustyAngel47#7299: oh
DustyAngel47#7299: what other discord
Verlio_H#0201: does this have to do with that thing you always mention in other discord
DustyAngel47#7299: I can say it was a lucky generation by xbox live or something
DustyAngel47#7299: so on the offchance i need to convince someone i dont like [hint redacted]
DustyAngel47#7299: I made it to have plausible deniability
DustyAngel47#7299: Ah
DustyAngel47#7299: (Its not a hitman reference)
DustyAngel47#7299: so does 47
DustyAngel47#7299: yes
Verlio_H#0201: wait does dustyangel actually mean anything
Dragon Lord#6944: But the connection between the nickname and the profile picture wasn't for some unknown reason...
Dragon Lord#6944: It was to me...
DustyAngel47#7299: i mean the eye wasnt really that obvious
DustyAngel47#7299: lol
Dragon Lord#6944: I mean, I saw the eye and all previous pfps, just didn't connect the two
DustyAngel47#7299: maybe it took the two arms
DustyAngel47#7299: good question
Dragon Lord#6944: ü§¶
Dragon Lord#6944: How the fuck did I *just* get your nic, <@714583473804935238> ?
Broyojo#2667: well procedure
DustyAngel47#7299: you do everything by calling x
DustyAngel47#7299: ah yes, it should include functions as well
DustyAngel47#7299: Lets ignore how much memory you would need to store that
DustyAngel47#7299: And thats the limit of the array
DustyAngel47#7299: eventually you would run out of memory that you could hold, say, a string in
DustyAngel47#7299: virtually infinite
Broyojo#2667: infinite possibilities
Broyojo#2667: yes
Broyojo#2667: well lets say 69420 is the address of the print function
DustyAngel47#7299: x is an array of every possible string, int, bool, etc. and there is no way to know what is where in the array without trying it
Broyojo#2667: and procedures are not variables so
Broyojo#2667: because maybe number literals are still allowed
Broyojo#2667: I was thinking more of assembly style
Broyojo#2667: ```go <[newline]> x[6] := 123 // save parameter <[newline]> x[9] := 3   // save return address <[newline]> goto 69420  // goto address of print procedure <[newline]> halt <[newline]> ```
Broyojo#2667: well you are putting two to the power of itself multiple times
DustyAngel47#7299: because i just realized one to the power of anything is one
DustyAngel47#7299: 2
Broyojo#2667: what is the value of x though
Broyojo#2667: oh god
Broyojo#2667: it would just be assembly honestly
DustyAngel47#7299: x is a number and you have to get to all other numbers using exponents
Broyojo#2667: and write data to it
Broyojo#2667: and you can get data out of through indexing
Broyojo#2667: like X is just the name of the memory
Broyojo#2667: it would be an interesting language to actually make and use

Dragon Lord#6944: we need to delete the universe because it came from oppressive history
PseudoGoose#2841: i think that's what it means but that's not what I read at a glance

PseudoGoose#2841: although i think i just misunderstood that first point
Verlio_H#0201: we need to delete european countries because they came from oppressive history
PseudoGoose#2841: wow okay, so I guess we have to cancel male/female/mating as terms that we use because they came from oppressive history

Dragon Lord#6944: food and mouth plugs
Red_3D#3062: I dont see how that would be any better
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
Jimmy#8080: I would be so happy to see those terms on official spec documentation
Jimmy#8080: New idea: call them "raging hard boner" and "gently puckered asshole"
Dragon Lord#6944: innie/outie is discriminatory against creatures that do not have a navel
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Or outport inport
Verlio_H#0201: no like how it sticks out
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Output/input?
Verlio_H#0201: we should use out/in instead

PseudoGoose#2841: The term has always meant that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: >electronics having a biological gender
PseudoGoose#2841: Ugh
PseudoGoose#2841: But see
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Nowadays, it would probably be more acceptable to use "biologically male/female" or something, which is a pain in the ass to say
Dragon Lord#6944: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Ah, they all know about sexual reproduction, they've just never done it before
PseudoGoose#2841: Haha funni nerds
Verlio_H#0201: but see generally the people who make these terms dont know anything about sexual reproduction
PseudoGoose#2841: It's (literally) just life. But if you really don't like it and don't want to use it, plug + receptacle terminology is also pretty common if you want to use that instead.  <[newline]>  <[newline]> But male + female just clicks for anybody who knows anything about sexual reproduction, which is most humans because that is how our species works.

Stenodyon#8192: apparently it's been updated
Stenodyon#8192: 
Dragon Lord#6944: ohhhhhh
Stenodyon#8192: page 102-103
Stenodyon#8192: the actual table with all the fields is in the GATT Specification Supplement here: https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=429632
Stenodyon#8192: it's supported by the "User Data Service"
PseudoGoose#2841: It's not part of the "core" Bluetooth spec, just some random protocol that the Bluetooth standards group has decided to publish
PseudoGoose#2841: same reason why USB has device classes that define standard interfaces for common functionality. It's not just a communication/link/transport layer, there's also a lot of "application-layer" definitions to try and encourage compatibility in the ecosystem.
PseudoGoose#2841: looks like nobody has yet uncovered the original source of this tweet (that specific table, though I found references to gender in some user data sections). Or if they have, they haven't bothered to post it. Unless OP posted it in a reply somewhere in the thread, which I can't view (see 1)
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
PseudoGoose#2841: i dove into twitter to see what I could find but didn't make it very far because 1. they limit who can view their tweets üòí and 2. holy shit twitter reading way too far into this
Dragon Lord#6944: that's my guess at least, based on the fact that engineers tend to get stuck in their ways when they get older
Dragon Lord#6944: ie, a mouse would be a male bluetooth device because it would have a male usb port if wired
Dragon Lord#6944: it's just to keep it consistent with previous formats
Jimmy#8080: because bluetooth is wireless
Dragon Lord#6944: but why were you asking why it was in the spec?
Jimmy#8080: and this is called "USB-A female"
Jimmy#8080: i.e. this is called "USB-A male"
Jimmy#8080: Yes, that's what I was referring to
Dragon Lord#6944: sorry, should have done that as a response... it was in response to this
MiniStumpy#5653: wat
Dragon Lord#6944: isn't the male/female standard harking back to cables/pipes in which one goes into the other to connect?

Verlio_H#0201: who knows
Jimmy#8080: Regardless, why the hell is it in the bluetooth spec?
Jimmy#8080: Is this about gender for people or gender of ports/plugs?
Verlio_H#0201: another perspective: there is a larger precentage of male users than female users than unspecified users etc
PseudoGoose#2841: another perspective: male < female < unspecified < all other genders
PseudoGoose#2841: ~~patriarchy strikes again~~

DanielGJ44#4557: Professors asking me to sign up for third party "academic" sites, or worse, using MY PERSONAL INFORMATION to sign up on my behalf without permission, can fuck off

tatertacoma#1234: lol, "COPPA" makes me thing of this site called "everfi" that my tech teacher uses that asked me (an 8th grader) if I had a debit card, how old I am, etc....
DanielGJ44#4557: When people bitch and moan about windows 99% of the time it's something I am unaware is a problem on lower versions lmao
DanielGJ44#4557: Plus it has more features than pro which I'm totally down for
DanielGJ44#4557: It's the most private windows because of COPPA or whatever the kids law is preventing data collection of children
tatertacoma#1234: I tried to do linux but I was having problem that I couldnt figure out how to fix and I gave up...
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah I get keys for 10 Education through school, which is above Pro but under Enterprise, and all the telemetry and Cortana shit is off
FacePox#2708: only reason I have a windows partition is some games
tatertacoma#1234: I dont have my school laptop or I would test that

Red_3D#3062: always write clean and tell the compiler how you want it to be. <[newline]> except if its absolutely performance critical and you know what you are doing

PseudoGoose#2841: hey wait that's not bad code, that's a legitimate technique
Dragon Lord#6944: i mean, the sub also had someone do a line 10 times instead of using a loop
Red_3D#3062: lmfao

FacePox#2708: TEST will say that goons are bad for the game they're toxic etc., what they really want is to create a ring of allied groups around the entire map so they can rent out systems to smaller groups
FacePox#2708: they hate us cause they ain't us üôÇ
RyanT#1426: So someone messed with the test alliance?
PseudoGoose#2841: Yeah, but that's about it
DanielGJ44#4557: Local news channels almost always have local advertising
Verlio_H#0201: yeah sometimes they are localized to like the city area
PseudoGoose#2841: not just the big stuff
PseudoGoose#2841: but like, tell me about all of the interesting stuff near me
PseudoGoose#2841: I think they are localized in some cases, I have seen some from the local STL/Missouri region
PseudoGoose#2841: maybe not _hyper_local but local
PseudoGoose#2841: i would be completely ok with that tbh
DanielGJ44#4557: big meme
PseudoGoose#2841: on tv
PseudoGoose#2841: imagine if there were hyperlocal ads
PseudoGoose#2841: that's the other thing
DanielGJ44#4557: I don't think it's variety in advertisers that the issue lies, its that the ads you are seeing were paid for by mega companies with millions and the chance of seeing a company that only spend 10k on an ad is comparatively tiny
Verlio_H#0201: I just type complete nonsense and dont proof read and just send it
PseudoGoose#2841: understandable
Verlio_H#0201: imagine editing your messages at all
DanielGJ44#4557: I see a lot of people editing the complete point of their messages after its sent and it confuses me
PseudoGoose#2841: i will edit them before and still edit them after
DanielGJ44#4557: is it only me who proofreads and edits my messages before I sell them
PseudoGoose#2841: You can also see this with the massive shift toward sponsored videos
Verlio_H#0201: that would be pog
PseudoGoose#2841: I think also the market value per ad has gone waaay down recently, because visibility is down. Not many advertisers/marketers actually want to buy ads anymore, and this also means you get the same ad played 5 times in a single 1hr program to fill up that space. There's no point to that, except for people who join the program late. Like imagine if every TV program and youtube video had the diversity/quantity of ads that you see during the super bowl, so that it's not the same 10 ads on repeat.
DanielGJ44#4557: fucking hilarious
DanielGJ44#4557: I like the Geico SCOOP THERE IT IS ad
DanielGJ44#4557: eh I still use it on my phone if I absolutely have to, but yeah
Verlio_H#0201: you guys are missing out there is some hilarious ads
DanielGJ44#4557: pog
Verlio_H#0201: me who doesn't use an adblocker and watches youtube a lot
DanielGJ44#4557: Just like I selectively decide what speed limits I find reasonable, as well as other road rules
DanielGJ44#4557: if it were a huge concern they'd just try to circumvent the adblockers like twitch did
DanielGJ44#4557: there is a point where enough is enough unfortunately
PseudoGoose#2841: assuming the price stays constant
DanielGJ44#4557: I used to be on that side of things, as well as the supporting creators side, and only recently started using adblock
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah but you kinda ruin the experience for people who don't use ad blockers. If half of the users use ad blockers, then the remaining people who don't will have to be served twice the number of ads to get the same revenue
DanielGJ44#4557: borderline unwatchable
DanielGJ44#4557: but I basically refuse to use youtube on my phone now lol
DanielGJ44#4557: At least youtube allows you to use an ad blocker
PseudoGoose#2841: 
DanielGJ44#4557: kinda scummy
DanielGJ44#4557: I remember having to do that on my first channel lol
DanielGJ44#4557: well I think ever since youtube started running ads on videos until recently, if you were a non-monetized creator you still had to disable them because they were on by default (even if you were making nothing off them)
PseudoGoose#2841: "By default, mid-rolls will be placed at natural breakpoints" yeah right, they count any visible transition in the video as a breakpoint, even in the middle of a scene
PseudoGoose#2841: well, you can still turn it off
DanielGJ44#4557: so that's interesting
DanielGJ44#4557: like recently
DanielGJ44#4557: hmmm, I've seen 30 minute videos on monetized channels without midrolls, only the starting ad
PseudoGoose#2841: dunno if that has changed since
PseudoGoose#2841: The thing is, it seems that midrolls are _on by default_ now, even for past uploaded videos that weren't opted in (ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnekbCdp_AE) and a lot of creators either don't know or don't bother to change it
FacePox#2708: if we could turn back time...
FacePox#2708: 
Jimmy#8080: I don't presently make money off of advertisements anywhere I don't plan to ever, I'm really uncomfortable with that method of monetization

ieee 802.11ac#6337: that is so foreboding i love it
DanielGJ44#4557: From my understanding, mid roll placement is at the discretion of the creator... You can opt to not have them or place them yourself. Generally it's creator greed that ruins the videos

PseudoGoose#2841: And to make things worse, their auto midroll placement is just garbage at finding good breaking points. <[newline]>  <[newline]> I swear they don't fix it because they want people to buy premium, like every fifth ad is a premium ad just to remind you that you can end your misery by just giving them your money
Jimmy#8080: Yup, youtube has lost a lot of my ad revenue by sticking so many more ads in
PseudoGoose#2841: Watching without adblock is such a horrible experience now
PseudoGoose#2841: YouTube today: How many midrolls can we fit into a 10 minute video without annoying the hell out of the viewers?

Jimmy#8080: That would be very cool and empowered
Stenodyon#8192: I might end up going "fuck it, I'm changing it"
Stenodyon#8192: lmao
Jimmy#8080: it'll be so subtle that your irl friends won't notice
Jimmy#8080: or maybe one alpha layer each day
Jimmy#8080: one pixel each day
Jimmy#8080: new idea, slowly switch your current profile picture to the new one
Jimmy#8080: Yeah fair enough
Stenodyon#8192: I have all my servers and roles and nitro on this account so it would be a bit of a pain to switch though
Stenodyon#8192: ok I spent a little bit of time writing a counter-argument but actually you make a very good point
Jimmy#8080: What if you made a second discord account for the question-inducing profile picture that you didn't tell your irl friends about
Stenodyon#8192: I have a picrew pfp that I'd like to use but I have some IRL friends on discord that are going to ask me questions I don't want to answer lol
Stenodyon#8192: I think I haven't shown my face on the internet in the previous decade
PseudoGoose#2841: probably the most professional / snazzy / overall best picture i have had taken in a long time
PseudoGoose#2841: my old GH profile picture was a prom picture from several years ago

Stenodyon#8192: same
Jimmy#8080: If you have, I forgot about it lol
PseudoGoose#2841: i have never shown my face here, have I
Jimmy#8080: Except when you're speaking in VC, then I picture the cat with its mouth flapping
Stenodyon#8192: me too
Jimmy#8080: that profile picture is still how I picture you in my head
PseudoGoose#2841: it was a picrew
Stenodyon#8192: I remember you had a picrew pfp or something that looked like a picrew
Stenodyon#8192: lol

Jimmy#8080: Really!
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Not true, I run it open air because that's cheaper than buying a case lmao

DanielGJ44#4557: Lol
Reese4221#8317: good point
DanielGJ44#4557: Jimmy being there
Reese4221#8317: whats so appealing about jimmys basement?
DanielGJ44#4557: But I'll be going to Jimmy's permanently again
DanielGJ44#4557: And because of covid I had to go back to my own basement
jackson535#1361: oh sweet
DanielGJ44#4557: We went to school together so I've been there lol
Verlio_H#0201: no he lives in jimmys basement
jackson535#1361: you guys neighbors?
jackson535#1361: haeh
DanielGJ44#4557: Not going to go into any identifying detail but it's pretty awesome
DanielGJ44#4557: It's actually really nice to be honest
Verlio_H#0201: daniel whats it like in jimmys basement
Reese4221#8317: only 3 budgies and 2 finches now
jackson535#1361: 
DanielGJ44#4557: Big yikes
Reese4221#8317: my family at 6 budgies at one point
DanielGJ44#4557: It's a finished basement so it's not like a dungeon or anything
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah I mean it's out of the way and quiet with the concrete walls
jackson535#1361: great place to set stuff up out of the way of other people
Reese4221#8317: yes
jackson535#1361: basements are awesome
jackson535#1361: why am I in the basement
Reese4221#8317: **why are you in the basement**
DanielGJ44#4557: Yes
Reese4221#8317: oh your in the basement
DanielGJ44#4557: They're not in my basement, main floor on opposite side of house
DanielGJ44#4557: Not my choice unfortunately
Reese4221#8317: why do you have seven lovebirds in your basement
DanielGJ44#4557: In the basement they're just barely audible over my current headphones
DanielGJ44#4557: Ah
jackson535#1361: noise cancelling headphones tend to block low frequencies really well, but noise isolating blocks high frequencies
jackson535#1361: noise cancelling will most likely work less than noise isolating in that case
Reese4221#8317: why do you have seven birds
DanielGJ44#4557: Maybe I should get noise cancelling eventually
DanielGJ44#4557: I have decent sound suppression headphones
jackson535#1361: sounds annoying
jackson535#1361: lmfao
DanielGJ44#4557: But can't go anywhere else so something I deal with lol
DanielGJ44#4557: We have 7 lovebirds that shriek at high frequency all day, definitely above 85dB
jackson535#1361: and np
jackson535#1361: unlikely unless you are working with tablesaws and stuff like that. you can hear really loud sounds as long as it isn't more than a few minutes or a few hours
DanielGJ44#4557: That's good information, thanks for sharing. I've often worried if I'm at risk for hearing damage with ambient sound
jackson535#1361: people are also much less conscious of the volume level with headphones/earphones than they are with speakers. this is one of the attributes which make studio monitoring speakers ideal over headphones
jackson535#1361: high frequencies are much more prone to causing hearing damage than low frequencies, because the hair-like nerves in your cochlear are much thicker and sturdier for low frequencies and much thinner and more fragile for high frequencies
jackson535#1361: annoying people using earbuds at max volume are subjecting themselves to anywhere from 105 to 118db
jackson535#1361: anything above 120db can cause severe hearing damage quickly
jackson535#1361: the degree of damage and exposure time required goes up from there
jackson535#1361: musicians often mix at 80 to 85db
jackson535#1361: any sounds below that are off the scale of hearing damage
jackson535#1361: extremely slight hearing damage can occur from prolonged lifetime exposure to sounds above roughly 85db
jackson535#1361: bull!

PseudoGoose#2841: I think he means to say imaginary lengths
PseudoGoose#2841: not 100% accurate either though, as there is no "negative" length here. So, dubious
PseudoGoose#2841: 
PseudoGoose#2841: that's not how complex works though
Broyojo#2667: yeah we eventually reached the base case https://discord.com/channels/401255675264761866/403343343775383552/816332508782133258
Dragon Lord#6944: Also, that was a lot of recursion!
Dragon Lord#6944: You seem to be forgetting that it is mathematically incorrect anyway. A triangle with one side length 'i' is actually a triangle with a side length one in the complex direction. The triangle should actually have a side length of the square root of 2 for the hypotenuse, but that kind of ruins the funny.

Deleted User#0000: Personally, I like scaling the triangle by a factor of `i` -- you still get a hypotenuse of 0, with legs -1 and i -- yet unlike this triangle which is pretty great on its own (putting two together creates a rectangle with an area of i and diagonal of 0) -- the final rectangle has a negative imaginary area (-i) and a diagonal of 0

Dragon Lord#6944: but steer clear of camp Santa Clause (last I checked it was under quarantine due to hantavirus) and Black Horse (the only place in a desert to have the humidity of a jungle and more bears than you can shake a stick at).
Dragon Lord#6944: we did ~97 miles full pack, and a ~12 mile day trip with reduced load up mount baldy. trip lasted somewhere around 7 days not including travel down there and back. Awesome place.
Dragon Lord#6944: back in 2013. my group was planning on going to baldy and the tooth of time, but a fire started and we got rerouted away from the tooth. still got to climb baldy though, and that was quite the view! <[newline]>  <[newline]> I definitely recommend it if you get the chance.

FacePox#2708: I know
Dragon Lord#6944: this has been a backpacking psa
Dragon Lord#6944: *Always* walk your pack over water. packs can hold your nose and mouth down even in less than an inch of water, which is less than idea for creatures with lungs.

Red_3D#3062: well
Verlio_H#0201: thats what the gpu is for

Red_3D#3062: that sounds fun
Red_3D#3062: have it be a gpu cluster and the cpus do io and distribute the tasks
Verlio_H#0201: the question is would 5 add up to 1 ps5
Red_3D#3062: yes
Broyojo#2667: ps1 cluster
Broyojo#2667: cluster
Broyojo#2667: that would be really cool
Red_3D#3062: I bet you could actually write software for the ps1 cpu and gpu and use them as a parallel processor

DustyAngel47#7299: 
DustyAngel47#7299: found this in my facebook dl
Dragon Lord#6944: you could call it 'hash' because you could just store a bunch of hash tables with a small control setup
DustyAngel47#7299: so you can use it as a variable that you can access as well as calling it like a function
DustyAngel47#7299: and the function is just a dictionary with the inputs and respective outputs
DustyAngel47#7299: it gives you that value
DustyAngel47#7299: and whenever you call it
DustyAngel47#7299: it automatically generates the output for every possible set of variables you could give it
DustyAngel47#7299: whenever you define a function
DustyAngel47#7299: just thought of a terrible language idea
Dragon Lord#6944: Well, everything (including functions) are pointers in lua... but yeah. It's *really* nice. :)
RyanT#1426: in lua functions are a type of varaible
DustyAngel47#7299: why is it seemingly letting you define it as a function
DustyAngel47#7299: i can understand everything but the last one
RyanT#1426: lua is weird
Dragon Lord#6944: but with recursion he won't be awake in more than one body at once
RyanT#1426: well, he is a fork bomb that can decide when to do another fork
Dragon Lord#6944: nah, just recursion. if he was a fork bomb, he would instantly fill any room he entered with concurrently conscious versions of himself
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because it hit an int 3?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Would the world just freeze?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Imagine being an std::thread and accidentally accessing outside of your allocated range
RyanT#1426: so a fork bomb?
Dragon Lord#6944: Imagine a super hero who's power was recursion: he can freeze in place and duplicate. when the clone says 'return' or is killed, the most recent clone wakes back up.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Bam
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: New thread: spawn new thread
Red_3D#3062: recursion, but you call it on a new thread every time
RyanT#1426: ~~STACK~~ THREAD OVERFLOW!!!
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Recursive multithreading
Red_3D#3062: I said that you dont have thousands of problems now
Dragon Lord#6944: you just said the same thing as "let's multi-thread it"
Red_3D#3062: at lest you didnt throw the problem at the gpu

Deleted User#0000: a similar process also happens for each universe, on the megauniverse hyperspheroid
Deleted User#0000: they share information and, through this sharing of information, in a manner not really understood by man, the hyperspheroid expands outwards, increasing the total repsid count contained along the surface volume of the universe
Deleted User#0000: each repsid is entangled with its 8 neighbor units in a hyperspherical yet finite universe

Deleted User#0000: repsid be like:
Deleted User#0000: or else one pot would need to get the exact angle to go in
Deleted User#0000: so that means that the pot would have to be perfectly rotated in order to collide
Deleted User#0000: and there's no "error checking" for whether some vertices on the pot should collide
Deleted User#0000: and the outside of the "inner" pot doesn't match the inside of the "outer" pot exactly
Deleted User#0000: i'd guess that it's too costly to make the interior of a pot's collision box actually a decent approximation of a circle

Red_3D#3062: pure existence sounds fun
Broyojo#2667: he just "is"
Broyojo#2667: or he may not even be made out of atoms
Broyojo#2667: and keeps the same sphere shape
Broyojo#2667: because it scales perfectly down
Broyojo#2667: the molecular structure would be interesting
Broyojo#2667: but then it has to compress
Broyojo#2667: I guess it is a cell wall because pretty much nothing goes through it
Broyojo#2667: has those big patches of outer cell wall just cut out
Broyojo#2667: oh yeah formal bobby
Red_3D#3062: this is too much for me
Red_3D#3062: please
Red_3D#3062: omfg
Broyojo#2667: has to compress a lot
Broyojo#2667: so that structure inside him
Broyojo#2667: he must become very dense
Broyojo#2667: also how does bobby shrink when he crouches
Broyojo#2667: so the face of bobby is the most permeable part of him
Broyojo#2667: or the cell membrane as gpt3 would say
Red_3D#3062: oh god
Red_3D#3062: please
Broyojo#2667: in the skin
Red_3D#3062: NO NO
Red_3D#3062: OH GOD
Broyojo#2667: are small incisions
Broyojo#2667: the black stuff on the front of bobby
Broyojo#2667: well maybe a cm thick
Red_3D#3062: so many questions
Broyojo#2667: but the pulsating
Red_3D#3062: who thicc is the dark layer under bobbies skin?
Broyojo#2667: well we don't know if bobby has blood
Broyojo#2667: ok lol
Red_3D#3062: if at all
Red_3D#3062: still image only
Red_3D#3062: no no
Red_3D#3062: I aint animating something like that
Broyojo#2667: and it has to be a 1000C knife
Red_3D#3062: OH NO
Broyojo#2667: slices
Broyojo#2667: a knife comes
Broyojo#2667: bobby is there
Broyojo#2667: yeah so it would be like
Red_3D#3062: I could try to make a crossection of that
Red_3D#3062: 
Broyojo#2667: so we can see the inner structures
Broyojo#2667: someone should make a cross-section of bobby
Red_3D#3062: I do not like any of this
Broyojo#2667: and is now a dark figure
Red_3D#3062: o-o
Broyojo#2667: which is took off
Broyojo#2667: or bobby's own skin
Broyojo#2667: also those aren't dino nuggets those are squished bobbies
Broyojo#2667: he does
Broyojo#2667: oh no
Red_3D#3062: <:bobby_thinking:692790276938399835>
Broyojo#2667: imagine if bobby had hands
Red_3D#3062: there we go

Broyojo#2667: could you draw them in real time?
commanderguy3001#6660: no texturing though
commanderguy3001#6660: that could render basic triangles
commanderguy3001#6660: i once made a 3d rendering thingie
Broyojo#2667: actually let me try doing that
Broyojo#2667: or a raytracer
DustyAngel47#7299: Stop

DustyAngel47#7299: so is it even worth it if i don't use it
DustyAngel47#7299: so a lot of my code is going to need more work than backslashes
DustyAngel47#7299: it doesn't help that the majority of the time i use the home var
PseudoGoose#2841: That's going to be platform specific
PseudoGoose#2841: Uhhh yes, if you're dealing with absolute paths then yeah
DustyAngel47#7299: it doesn't seem to do that on its own
DustyAngel47#7299: but i would still assumedly have to append the `c:` at the beginning
DustyAngel47#7299: hmm
PseudoGoose#2841: Looks promising
DustyAngel47#7299: they use `c:/` in their examples
DustyAngel47#7299: hmm, it looks so
PseudoGoose#2841: Path instantiates PosixPath or WindowsPath depending on the platform, and I think they each account for path separators
PseudoGoose#2841: "with semantics appropriate for different operating systems." I would assume so
DustyAngel47#7299: does pathlib support that?
PseudoGoose#2841: `os.sep` and also `pathlib`
FacePox#2708: I thought they added polish language support or something
DustyAngel47#7299: it is aint it

FacePox#2708: like polishing a spoon

DustyAngel47#7299: yea it supports X
DustyAngel47#7299: because its so annoying to do <[newline]> ```python <[newline]> if os.system == 'nt': <[newline]>   backslashpath_here <[newline]> else: <[newline]>   normalpath_here``` <[newline]> this everytime you need a path
Broyojo#2667: it is a linux sub system
RyanT#1426: I thought it just emulated the bash terminal
RyanT#1426: WSL supports GUIS?
DustyAngel47#7299: i mean, just about nothing i make that uses paths supports it at this point
DustyAngel47#7299: tell them to use wsl
RyanT#1426: well its either that or only like 10-20% of computer users can play your game soo...
Jimmy#8080: I wish üòî
DustyAngel47#7299: yea i wish that was an option in windows
RyanT#1426: ``` <[newline]> C:\reverse slashes <[newline]> SLASHES REVERSED! <[newline]> C:/ <[newline]> ```
DustyAngel47#7299: well thats what you get for supporting windows smhmh
Jimmy#8080: At least a couple times a month I have to use backslashes for a file path and I get pissed that MS made that braindead decision 40 years ago
DustyAngel47#7299: msdos uses the backslash
DustyAngel47#7299: well still
RyanT#1426: I'm going for MS-DOS/ Command Prompt

Red_3D#3062: you can stop
Red_3D#3062: thank, I got it
Deleted User#0000: Many celebrities have 2 different names, a stage name and a real name. The one used as autograph usually portrays their stage name. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Best example that comes to mind is Kendrick Lamar being a stage name but Duckworth being his legal last name.
Deleted User#0000: ("probably"
Deleted User#0000: Autographs tend to be just a scrawl, not a full signature. This is assuming they have the common sense to not allow multiple copies of their official signature in the wild
Red_3D#3062: yes, yes
Red_3D#3062: ah, ok
Deleted User#0000: (personal story; yes)
Deleted User#0000: I'm not a celebrity, but I am a musician who signs lots of my own CDs for fans. I made the decision to have a separate "autograph" signature, like you're describing, so I wouldn't risk revealing my actual signature I use for banking, official documents, etc. I would assume others who sign things regularly do this, too. Good question!
Deleted User#0000: (yes)
Deleted User#0000: Yes. I worked at the KBToys by the Boston Celtics practice facility in the 90's/00's and they all had different signatures for their credit cards than their autographs. The top players (Pierce and Walker) had an assistant pay, even if they were with the assistant.

Deleted User#0000: funyyyyy

Deleted User#0000: get it
Deleted User#0000: the S stands for suicide
Red_3D#3062: makro yes
Deleted User#0000: yeah
Stefan#5422: Just write a makro that does it for every key stroke
Red_3D#3062: because I want to
commanderguy3001#6660: why?
commanderguy3001#6660: wait wut?!?
Red_3D#3062: so ever 2s
Red_3D#3062: I will make a macro that commits everytime I hit ctrl + s
commanderguy3001#6660: nah, you don't need to
Red_3D#3062: yes I do
Red_3D#3062: 
commanderguy3001#6660: you don't need to push every time you make a commit
Red_3D#3062: lol, ima just have 50 private reeeeepos
commanderguy3001#6660: then use something like gitlab or just git push always if you have internet available
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because git is logical like that, yeah
Deleted User#0000: yes
Red_3D#3062: but I have two machines that need my code
commanderguy3001#6660: you can
commanderguy3001#6660: yeah, absolutely
Red_3D#3062: ah
commanderguy3001#6660: no remote means just local
Red_3D#3062: you can do that
Red_3D#3062: no remotes
Red_3D#3062: what
Red_3D#3062: yes, I know how to push pull merge commit
commanderguy3001#6660: and don't use remote's
commanderguy3001#6660: just don't make any git push
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: but i couldn't care less about a backup made 2 weeks ago
Red_3D#3062: but I dont know how to git without github
Deleted User#0000: i understand keeping *one* backup
Red_3D#3062: see, I would use git
Red_3D#3062: why waste storage space
Deleted User#0000: obviously
Deleted User#0000: the latest code is the best code
commanderguy3001#6660: yeah, i'm just using git for backup-purposes
Red_3D#3062: its just extra data and totally useless
Stefan#5422: so
Red_3D#3062: why would you
Stefan#5422: I deleted my entire source folder of vsstudio once
Deleted User#0000: i have never done that
Deleted User#0000: over my 9 years of programming
Red_3D#3062: no
Deleted User#0000: people have backups of their code?
Deleted User#0000: wait
Red_3D#3062: yes
Red_3D#3062: phew
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But then you notice there's a .bak file in the same folder that's 4 min old
Red_3D#3062: oh boy
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: When your debugging database you've been working on for 17 hours suddenly vanished
Red_3D#3062: aka bad file management so it was totally my fault
Red_3D#3062: it was caused by moving files between computers and having multiple versions on both of them
Red_3D#3062: well
Stefan#5422: I have a backup every hour but still
Red_3D#3062: I have definitely done this a few times
Red_3D#3062: probably
Stefan#5422: Am I too un-redundant to understand this backup meme

commanderguy3001#6660: btw: why are we writing in <#403343343775383552> ?

Red_3D#3062: well, duck text editors who disregard the global clipboard
Deleted User#0000: i have finally produced an argument to this meme: what if your text editor considers copying to clipboard a separate action (so undoing it would restore clipboard) -- thereby fucking up your ctrl+y'ing? or what if you did ctrl+x by accident instead? HMMMMMMMMMMM?
Deleted User#0000: maybe it was meant to be open but the artist(s) got lazy and just left it closed

Deleted User#0000: i feel like i'm missing a lot of the context from this video without the sound
PseudoGoose#2841: if that domain is also the largest set possible, then the range is the largest set possible, and so it is the only codomain
PseudoGoose#2841: so if the "selected domain" of the function is "symmetric" (where -x is a member for any member x), then its range is its domain
PseudoGoose#2841: or any set of numbers really
PseudoGoose#2841: or any other "complex" space like quaternions
PseudoGoose#2841: it can be defined for C -> C
PseudoGoose#2841: f(x) = -x
FacePox#2708: I guess the real question is a permutation of all things
FacePox#2708: I‚Äôm sure you could come up with a bijection that acts on all things
PseudoGoose#2841: (if the codomain is even restricted to numbers <:monkas:555120573752279056>)
PseudoGoose#2841: unlesss somehow its image/range is the set of all numbers, idfk how that would even happen
FacePox#2708: The codomain is the integers plus the set of all dogs
FacePox#2708: Yep
PseudoGoose#2841: what really bugs me is that there are infinitely many codomains for (almost) any given function
FacePox#2708: So like if I had the function f(x) = x + ix, then I could say that real numbers are the domain and complex numbers are the codomain, but the range is the set of a + ia for all real a
FacePox#2708: The codomain can actually be kinda arbitrary
FacePox#2708: The range is a subset of the codomain such that every element of it is the result of doing the function on an element of the domain. The range is the part of the codomain that you actually get out.
Dragon Lord#6944: isn't codomain a more broad term, while range is only for functions?
FacePox#2708: yes I know that those are two different things

Red_3D#3062: I am very creative
Red_3D#3062: no lol, my previous internet name was Red_Redstone
Stefan#5422: When you say booru I get a tad scared
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Thanks webarchive
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It was a real thing, but now just lands you on a "this booru doesn't exist" page
Stefan#5422: Wait do you know stone_red
Red_3D#3062: aka me
Red_3D#3062: Don't summon Red_Redstone
Red_3D#3062: Oh god
Stefan#5422: 10/10
Stefan#5422: 
Stefan#5422: uhm
Red_3D#3062: I like cats
Red_3D#3062: Hahaha, so cute and funny
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: Duck this, cat meme time
Stefan#5422: the booru?
Stefan#5422: it is an actual good invention
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: No way
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I-is the booru dead
Stefan#5422: I like that bar
Red_3D#3062: lmao
Red_3D#3062: What would they do without the genius bar?
Stefan#5422: Ah ok
Red_3D#3062: I might hate their products, but some people with too much money sure find them useful
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: So I'll be right back
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I did learn that cloverOS apparently has it's own booru filled with yuri
Red_3D#3062: I don't want apple to die
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *however*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It appears to just be a meme
Red_3D#3062: Actually
Red_3D#3062: Nice
Stefan#5422: not stonks
Stefan#5422: 
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Stefan#5422: hmm
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I'm not sure if debian for lesbians is an actual thing but it sure would be nice
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Hana montana linux and moebuntu and debian for lesbians are all several times better than macOS
Stefan#5422: Stop burning his bench maybe?
Red_3D#3062: My friend who got destroyed by my benchmark did not like the Apple bench
Stefan#5422: Less known then windows more stupid then even the best of best hana montana linux and loved by the music industry ... wh- wait what?
Stefan#5422: (Not really but yes)
Stefan#5422: Also they have a proprietary OS
Stefan#5422: Its a heated bench
Red_3D#3062: With heating elements
Red_3D#3062: They aren't computers, they are pretty furniture
Stefan#5422: Its a space heater
Stefan#5422: I mean
Red_3D#3062: That's all it's good for

Verlio_H#0201: and if you have to pay 20 dollars for a different w thats kinda stupid imo
Verlio_H#0201: yeah most fonts are just slight edits of other fonts u know
CrispyPin#1149: we kinda don't need to be making them anymore
CrispyPin#1149: there are a lot of almost identical fonts
CrispyPin#1149: there are a lot of fonts
CrispyPin#1149: also like
Verlio_H#0201: yeah I mean I guess like 5 bucks is reasonable but they literally like show you the font and for bitmap fonts you can easially pass the paywall
CrispyPin#1149: 109$ is absurd tho
CrispyPin#1149: so it makes sense
CrispyPin#1149: well they put a lot of time and effort into it
PseudoGoose#2841: I hate when people sell art it doesn't really make much sense to me
Verlio_H#0201: I hate when people sell fonts it doesn't really make much sense to me

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: they blocked GME stock buying a bit back I believe
DanielGJ44#4557: RobinHood is going to get fucked from this I think though unless there is an SEC ruling supporting what they did retroactively
DanielGJ44#4557: well "legal" is somewhat questionable since it can be seen as conspiracy, but IMO not worse than what companies "legally" do
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I like bollions lets keep it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: "bollions"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: news sites baffled to see a bunch of self-proclaimed "massive retards" with üöÄ üöÄ  emoji everywhere make dumb jokes, then suddenly making gamestop worth several bollions

Verlio_H#0201: 2 is, andrew is jimmys mom and jimmys brother
Verlio_H#0201: no
Nik#1011: I feel like 2 and 3 are the same?
Verlio_H#0201: Jimmy's mom and jimmy's brother andrew <[newline]> Jimmy's both mom and brother andrew <[newline]> Jimmy's mom, and someones brother andrew
Nik#1011: ?
Verlio_H#0201: you can read it like 3 ways really
Nik#1011: <@154964593397989376> üëÄ

FacePox#2708: I‚Äôll keep an eye out on the forum where I met them and see if anyone with a similar username pops up
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That would be quite sad indeed
FacePox#2708: I‚Äôm afraid she got depressed and deleted everything
FacePox#2708: She was talking about how the winter in Norway was getting her down with all the darkness right before she left
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But he didn't delete his account, I wonder what would have caused that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: His online activity was just non-existent
FacePox#2708: ...o
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Sorry I didn't mean he *actually* died

FacePox#2708: But
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yes, years back
FacePox#2708: Wait
FacePox#2708: I thought he died
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: He's back now though, not very active, but slightly
FacePox#2708: Jesus I‚Äôm sorry
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And ~~he died~~ his online activity was non-existent until last year-ish
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I had a friend on steam from wayyy back when I was like 8
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh I know that feeling, it's very sad...
FacePox#2708: I guess there‚Äôs no use worrying about it because I can‚Äôt contact them. I just hope they didn‚Äôt hit a spurt of depression or something.

FacePox#2708: I guess what I really want to know is what events transpired to have this happen
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Much easier than the average GUI program which has default settings hidden inside tabs and windows you didn't know existed

FacePox#2708: Stupid meme incoming
DanielGJ44#4557: Apparently throwing money at a situation prevents the spread of an invisible and largely misunderstood virus
DanielGJ44#4557: So that's Twitter
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean there's unfounded calls for the Premier of Ontario to resign based on their assumption that him investing more in public health would have stopped/slowed the pandemic, somehow
FacePox#2708: it's like they never evolved out of a middle school level perception of other people
FacePox#2708: this tweet really pisses me off
DanielGJ44#4557: Like I shouldn't have to enter dimensions, use 3 tools, and check 5 boxes to orient a video vertically, on top of changing the project settings
DanielGJ44#4557: Vegas Pro (at least older ones) like to make things extremely versatile, however, makes things difficult to figure out if you are trying to complete something quickly
DustyAngel47#7299: personally i have been using shotcut because thats all i can get to work with nvenc for some reason
Red_3D#3062: but dont use it for anything other than croping / rotating / resizing / transcoding
DustyAngel47#7299: (/s thats a dumb thing to do imo)
DustyAngel47#7299: like a real `I'd like to interject`er
DanielGJ44#4557: I say the same about Solidworks and other CAD programs and get frustrated when Blender doesn't have any similarities
Red_3D#3062: I like ffmpeg
DustyAngel47#7299: personally i just use ffmpeg to edit
Red_3D#3062: blender is awesome because of how consistent and fast you can get with years of experience of using the shortcuts
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean I kinda stopped doing blender for the same reason
Red_3D#3062: every software is different

DanielGJ44#4557: I have somewhat extensive experience in Lightworks and Vegas Pro so it'll be a bit of a change for me
Red_3D#3062: its very different from what I'm used to
DanielGJ44#4557: really the only thing I do on linux is GIMP and Blender
Red_3D#3062: I tried, gave up not long after
DanielGJ44#4557: I've been thinking about using Kdenlive soon
Red_3D#3062: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: to be fair a lot of the programs I need to run barely run on windows lmao so I can't fault it too much
Red_3D#3062: what could you possibly need except emacs? smh
DanielGJ44#4557: kinda sad
DanielGJ44#4557: so in a lot of cases you can, but sometimes it isn't worth it
Red_3D#3062: we dont mention those
Red_3D#3062: shhhh
DanielGJ44#4557: there are programs I've needed to run that won't work on linux reliably or at all to the point where it's not worth trying to run
Red_3D#3062: its not that hard to find good software for gnu + linux
Red_3D#3062: or alternatives
DanielGJ44#4557: you are not allowed to mention those
Red_3D#3062: wine
RyanT#1426: but what 'bout the programs that don't work
Red_3D#3062: but the theme is ugly af
Red_3D#3062: modern Linux has most of the functionality of that windows without all the bloat
RyanT#1426: so you like the look of windows but not the functionality?
Red_3D#3062: get bamboozled <:bobby_dab:692790273490550855>
DustyAngel47#7299: yes
RyanT#1426: well you installed an windows 9x theme
DustyAngel47#7299: gnu plus linux
Red_3D#3062: gnu + linux
DustyAngel47#7299: or as i've taken to calling it
DustyAngel47#7299: is actually gnu/linux
DustyAngel47#7299: what you are calling windows 9x
Red_3D#3062: Id like to interject for a moment
RyanT#1426: BLUETOOTH ON WINDOWS 9X??!!
DustyAngel47#7299: fantastic titlebar

CrispyPin#1149: ok oidoid
FacePox#2708: I‚Äôve started using ‚Äúcentroid‚Äù as an insult
PseudoGoose#2841: thanks :)
PseudoGoose#2841: but it only supports two colors and has something like a "screen door" effect
Stefan#5422: I like yours better
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Not a lot of contrast though
PseudoGoose#2841: i guess the main advantage of yours is better contrast
Stefan#5422: ah ok
PseudoGoose#2841: mine uses transparency to blend colors differently on different backgrounds
Stefan#5422: hmh
PseudoGoose#2841: taking advantage of the fact that "dark on dark" is invisible
PseudoGoose#2841: that one alternates between using light colors on one line and dark colors on the other
Stefan#5422: so what is the difference
Stefan#5422: I still have the original
Stefan#5422: 
PseudoGoose#2841: 
PseudoGoose#2841: anyway, I did all of this because I wanted to make a better version of the original meme, because I remembered this technique from another demo. So here ya go
PseudoGoose#2841: whole ass-readme
Stefan#5422: after f(x) it all was downhill
Stenodyon#8192: 
PseudoGoose#2841: With RGB, there's always going to be some noticeable loss, and that is often directly linked to the colors on the opposite image, which means details can leak through. So it's not just about minimizing loss, but also masking those leaks
PseudoGoose#2841: because there's three color channels and only one alpha
PseudoGoose#2841: for now, it's just grayscale. RGB is a much harder problem with no "perfect" solution
PseudoGoose#2841: kind of like image steganography
PseudoGoose#2841: there might be some noise in the LSB of the color channels due to rounding and stuff, but if there is, it's basically imperceptible
PseudoGoose#2841: 
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yo that is freaking impressive how well that works
PseudoGoose#2841: discriminord update - grayscale works! The contrast isn't great but I'm working on improving it (and also creating a GUI with a preview)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And several dozen manga
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: There's at least a dozen anime on that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: They're complaining about that in genshin? Lol
Dragon Lord#6944: I think that they're complaining that people are shipping minors as gay in genshin.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Fair
Nik#1011: it doesn't need to make sense to end up on twitter
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Not really from genshin impact if it's an OC
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But that wouldn't make sense
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Some genshin impact OC?
Nik#1011: I think someone stole their character and made some weird sexualized statements that this person disagrees with
CrispyPin#1149: i literally cant tell what they are upset about
Nik#1011: I guess the only ones were "ooc" and "mhy"
Nik#1011: doesn't explain why they added a ton of extra characters lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: When you want to put your angry statement in a single twitter post
CrispyPin#1149: had a stroke reading it

Verlio_H#0201: oh somehow I just did but I clicked where it should bbe and it came back lol
Verlio_H#0201: I wanna know how to do that
Verlio_H#0201: to be entirely honest
Verlio_H#0201: yeah idk how he managed that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Unless they're low on power
DanielGJ44#4557: Using a dongle because you know
DanielGJ44#4557: I guess they could probably still connect a physical keyboard
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean try to defend Mac all you want, a disappearing fundamental key is pretty unacceptable
Verlio_H#0201: yes it does and it has more than that
CrispyPin#1149: it gives no benefit
CrispyPin#1149: what is even the point of having them on a touch screen
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's not like they don't have the space
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Why would you want a keyboard key to just vanish?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But yes while you could exit vim via other means, the problem is that the key even dissapears at all
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't really use vim so I might be wrong
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: You need to use escape
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I think in order to do much in vim
RyanT#1426: So MacOS has no equivalent to <[newline]> CRTL + ALT + DELETE (Task manager) <[newline]> CRTL + SHIFT + ESCAPE (Task manager again) <[newline]> ALT + F4 (Closes the program) <[newline]> Super key aka Windows Key (let's you access the start menu and other open programs) <[newline]> The program not responding (closes the program) OR <[newline]> Pressing the power / reset buttons?
Broyojo#2667: great theory: https://youtu.be/scuZuZUwmh4
Verlio_H#0201: ~~or command q~~
Verlio_H#0201: I also dont think he knows how to use the trackpad or do ccontrol + any arrow key

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: tfw your escape key isn‚Äôt physical

Red_3D#3062: you are too pure for my messed up humor, I love it Ryan
RyanT#1426: No
Verlio_H#0201: but have you been on a driving airplane
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
Red_3D#3062: ^^
RyanT#1426: Not a plane as in a 2D surface
RyanT#1426: I'm talking about a flying airplane
Red_3D#3062: u floating m8?
Red_3D#3062: a floor is a plane
Dragon Lord#6944: sure you have! you play logic world
RyanT#1426: I have never been on a plane before
Verlio_H#0201: exactly
Dragon Lord#6944: airplanes don't have batteries
Verlio_H#0201: yeah and he has 0% battery cause on airplane mode
Dragon Lord#6944: obviously he was on a 747 going over stoney creek nc. smh my head
DanielGJ44#4557: not his one but possibly
Verlio_H#0201: it was 747 at the time of that screenshot
Dragon Lord#6944: Error: battery == null
Verlio_H#0201: isn't stoney creek in nc?
RyanT#1426: Umm...
Dragon Lord#6944: especially since people (at least in the US) were still very suspicious of Russians from the cold war.
Verlio_H#0201: yeah according to my mom, one time someone came over from russia to meet my grandpa for something or something and the russian legitametaly thought they were putting on a show for him because he couldn't believe how epic gamer america was, althhough that was like somewhere from the 60s-70s so
Jimmy#8080: I love how the internet has allowed us to experience such a breadth of humanity. 30 years ago the barrier to entry for meeting someone who lives in Russia was orders of magnitude higher
Jimmy#8080: That sounds like a great experience
FacePox#2708: 10/10 experience would play video games with a Russian again
Verlio_H#0201: lol
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
FacePox#2708: So that was cool
FacePox#2708: Oh also he had hentai plastered all over his steam profile
Verlio_H#0201: ~~thats what I think of when someone says russian dont question it~~
FacePox#2708: Maybe
Verlio_H#0201: did you hear angry russians hitting their children with dowels
FacePox#2708: It was weird
FacePox#2708: Like something falling
FacePox#2708: Also there was a child singing in the background and occasional loud sounds
FacePox#2708: He barely spoke English but was using advanced military terminology to coordinate movement
FacePox#2708: The gameplay
FacePox#2708: Not the lore
FacePox#2708: the man took half life VERY SERIOUSLY
FacePox#2708: Let me tell you, all of the stereotypes of Russian gamers are true
Verlio_H#0201: nice
FacePox#2708: I played Sven Coop with a random Russian man from 4chan last night
Verlio_H#0201: feelings are not somethhing I do well wit
Verlio_H#0201: I'm definentaly not the person you want to confurt you lol
Verlio_H#0201: ^
Dragon Lord#6944: the second way is similar to 'you can hold your breath for the rest of your life'
Nik#1011: I meant that this medical condition is a once-in-a-lifetime issue
Nik#1011: what are the two ways?
Nik#1011: huh
Dragon Lord#6944: also, two*
Dragon Lord#6944: -_-
Verlio_H#0201: this could be read too ways

Nik#1011: idk how he kept working with that issue
Dragon Lord#6944: he doing okay?
Dragon Lord#6944: :(
Jimmy#8080: :(
Nik#1011: my dad had a recent medical issue that meant it was difficult for him to eat and talk, and lasted about 2 months
Verlio_H#0201: yeah
Nik#1011: well at least the recovery wasn't too long
Verlio_H#0201: damit red to fast
Verlio_H#0201: anyways hope u feel better soon (from covid)
Red_3D#3062: oh no, I hope it'l be gone soon
Verlio_H#0201: no jimmy, I dont think you understand, covid is thhe only medical condition
Jimmy#8080: Nah, it's a horrible fleshy lump on the inside of my lower lip. After a dentist visit and a week of treatment it's almost gone now.
Verlio_H#0201: jimmy has covid guys, confirmed rigth here
Verlio_H#0201: f
Jimmy#8080: Still coming, had a number of unfortunate delays. Currently unable to sing properly due to a medical condition, but that should be resolved in a few days.
FacePox#2708: Not sure how to feel about this

Nik#1011: dude where's the picture with jimmy making the silly face
PseudoGoose#2841: https://docs.rs/image/0.23.12/image/imageops/fn.resize.html
DustyAngel47#7299: how convienent
DustyAngel47#7299: using image
DustyAngel47#7299: time to figure out how to stretch images
DustyAngel47#7299: in that case
PseudoGoose#2841: and bigger dimensions will crop out the bottom/right edges of the light image
PseudoGoose#2841: it will panic (non-gracefully error) if the light image is smaller than the dark image in either dimension
DustyAngel47#7299: does it error out somewhere else?
DustyAngel47#7299: that detects if they arent the same size
DustyAngel47#7299: i just comment out the code
DustyAngel47#7299: what if
DustyAngel47#7299: i would do it myself but i dont know rust
PseudoGoose#2841: delightfully devilish
DustyAngel47#7299: exactly
PseudoGoose#2841: although i like that, introducing my own bias into the code and making it discriminate against light mode users
PseudoGoose#2841: KISS
DustyAngel47#7299: stretch it to the dark mode image's res
DustyAngel47#7299: just
DustyAngel47#7299: sad
DustyAngel47#7299: darn
PseudoGoose#2841: it's going to say "you do it"
PseudoGoose#2841: it's not going to sit there and figure out which way to crop stretch or otherwise fit them together is best
PseudoGoose#2841: resize them yourself
DustyAngel47#7299: time to find out
PseudoGoose#2841: error
DustyAngel47#7299: how does it handle differently sized images
DustyAngel47#7299: hmm
PseudoGoose#2841: but for rust stuff, apache/mit dual license is dominant
PseudoGoose#2841: depending on how much I care
PseudoGoose#2841: i'm starting to gravitate more toward 0/1/2 clause bsd
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Plus that way people can find the source themselves
PseudoGoose#2841: okay, of that magnitude, I would understand
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If you use a "big" library that I provide for free
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I mean that's only fair right
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Binaries too \>:)
PseudoGoose#2841: name on the source code form? or binaries too :o
DustyAngel47#7299: https://github.com/agausmann/discriminord/pull/1
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That's about it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I care about having my name on it and allowing people to use it without having to share full source
PseudoGoose#2841: wtfpl sux
PseudoGoose#2841: nah m8
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~nah m8 use wtfpl~~
PseudoGoose#2841: which is probably not you
PseudoGoose#2841: 0BSD is probably best if you don't care about it at all
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (and also fits what I want with it)
PseudoGoose#2841: join ussss
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: So i don't wanna change it till I find a good one that is less restrictive
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The other way around doesn't work
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't like gpl3 but I can go down to a license with less restrictions
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I say that jokingly but my "large project" still has gpl3
DustyAngel47#7299: ha
DustyAngel47#7299: its bsd 0clause
DustyAngel47#7299: but
DustyAngel47#7299: lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Try forking now muhaha
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Quick! Gpl3.0!

DustyAngel47#7299: 
PseudoGoose#2841: darke
DustyAngel47#7299: 
DustyAngel47#7299: i can confirm it works
PseudoGoose#2841: this project is kind of on the line between <[newline]> - being simple enough that I could make a webapp for it <[newline]> - not caring enough to actually make a webapp for it
DustyAngel47#7299: well

DustyAngel47#7299: heck
DustyAngel47#7299: ok compiling rn

DustyAngel47#7299: tags show up as releases
DustyAngel47#7299: well
DustyAngel47#7299: lol np
PseudoGoose#2841: (working on it)
PseudoGoose#2841: are there any releases? I just see a tag bruh
DustyAngel47#7299: `Prebuilt binaries are also available in the [GitHub releases][releases].`
DustyAngel47#7299: where are my prebuilt binaries smh
PseudoGoose#2841: okay I will add pictures, eventually
DustyAngel47#7299: give me a sec
DustyAngel47#7299: hold on
PseudoGoose#2841: COUGH ~~_yeah drake tell em_~~
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~submit a pull request~~
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
PseudoGoose#2841: now why would anybody want to see that
Jimmy#8080: Lmao <@!118121598388666375> how do you have a whole ass readme for your image generation program and not have any examples of generated images in that readme
RyanT#1426: umm... I was scrolling through the YT recommend videos and apparently some people don't what soup is lol
PseudoGoose#2841: it's as simple as solving a linear equation for each pixel, in theory

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And walmart too
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: What's up with americans and amazon

Stefan#5422: red you coward answer me
Red_3D#3062: yes, any component adds its effects to bunch
RyanT#1426: Also, do accessories connected to the computer with lights count? I wanna test if this is true (||Ik it's a joke||)
Red_3D#3062: some combos grant special effects
Red_3D#3062: because
Stefan#5422: what about ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà

Red_3D#3062: mildly increased skill
Red_3D#3062: in which case
Red_3D#3062: or its dark orange

PseudoGoose#2841: oh heck even more https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_x3YyNS3h7g6RUV0Z-4Ivp1MP_FxPgsN
PseudoGoose#2841: this one
PseudoGoose#2841: oh heck this is the sequel to the other one
PseudoGoose#2841: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ2cZrhnsQ
RyanT#1426: at least not all of them are the gh add
PseudoGoose#2841: omg what have you done to my recommendations D:

ForLoveOfCats#4111: (and yes I know I'm doing UB by modifying the string literal lol, that's part of the demonstration)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: anything can happen
ForLoveOfCats#4111: when I ran it elsewhere it segfaulted
ForLoveOfCats#4111: in this case it didn't print anything and returned garbage value
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Here I've "accidentally" overwritten the `\0` at the end of the string with a `'!'` which results in printf keeping reading until it eventually finds a 0 somewhere
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Memory insafety
Red_3D#3062: lol
Red_3D#3062: ever
Red_3D#3062: I dont use const
Red_3D#3062: thats why
Red_3D#3062: yes
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Memory in-safety is very fun but oh god it causes so many problems
Red_3D#3062: ts a great show
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Welcome to silly semantics! Brought to you by our sponsor "C"!
Red_3D#3062: >:(
Red_3D#3062: that doesnt count
Red_3D#3062: well
ForLoveOfCats#4111: after
ForLoveOfCats#4111: 
ForLoveOfCats#4111: before
Red_3D#3062: show
Red_3D#3062: no way
ForLoveOfCats#4111: by tricking the compiler into not constant folding
Red_3D#3062: what
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I figured out how to actually do it
Red_3D#3062: but I am counting it as a win
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Hah check this out
Red_3D#3062: I am technically not changing the const
Red_3D#3062: but this does
Red_3D#3062: but my c version did not work in c++
Red_3D#3062: yes
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's the same concept of casting away const though
Red_3D#3062: I did it in c
Red_3D#3062: no
Red_3D#3062: what
Red_3D#3062: wait
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yeah you already did that
Red_3D#3062: i is irrelevant
Red_3D#3062: but thats your opinion
Red_3D#3062: you may say that this does not count
Red_3D#3062: I changed MyMind
Red_3D#3062: I did it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: hence the existence of memory safe languages of various kinds
ForLoveOfCats#4111: btw it is good to acknowledge that all of this is Very Bad ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and can cause a great many issues in real world software
Red_3D#3062: I did it
Red_3D#3062: I think
Red_3D#3062: :O
Red_3D#3062: trying to cout nullptr segfaults
Red_3D#3062: lol
Red_3D#3062: hmm
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've done some googling to back this up but I was unable to find anything concrete
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm going to make the educated guess that the compiler is performing constant folding in C++ due to the higher "guarantee" that it is not to be modified compared to C
Red_3D#3062: yay
Red_3D#3062: C++ is a little bitch
Red_3D#3062: yee
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Your code works in C but not in C++
Red_3D#3062: even casting to void* and memseting that does not work
Red_3D#3062: it must be doing some protection
Red_3D#3062: this is real sad
Red_3D#3062: ofc it works with two normal ints
Red_3D#3062: oh ffs
Red_3D#3062: kinda
Red_3D#3062: but shouldnt this have worked?
Red_3D#3062: this is ub af
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Red_3D#3062: was stupid
Red_3D#3062: nvm
Red_3D#3062: even c does not like that
Red_3D#3062: huh
Red_3D#3062: c++ is really not liking this
Red_3D#3062: :(
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: : )
Red_3D#3062: why
Red_3D#3062: ofc it does not allow me to do that
Red_3D#3062: oh darn
Red_3D#3062: allocate it in a struct and calculate the offset based of a not const int
Red_3D#3062: lets
Red_3D#3062: they really do be linking their consts
Red_3D#3062: darn
Red_3D#3062: const int* is incompatible with void*
Red_3D#3062: WOW
Red_3D#3062: string.h :|
Red_3D#3062: hmm
ForLoveOfCats#4111: stdlib.h I think?
Red_3D#3062: where is memset defined?
Red_3D#3062: wait
ForLoveOfCats#4111: C++ handles this somewhat by making string literals be `const char *` by default but you can still cast away the const iirc
ForLoveOfCats#4111: because the string is defined in your data segment which you are not supposed to modify
ForLoveOfCats#4111: which is very much UB
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ```c <[newline]> int main() { <[newline]>   char *string = "1234"; <[newline]>   *string = "4321"; <[newline]>   return 0; <[newline]> }```
RyanT#1426: C*?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: However C *will* let you do this
ForLoveOfCats#4111: it just means "immutable" (in big ass air quotes)
Red_3D#3062: this sounds like c was made to have this
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ok yeah so that's what I thought. In C const is not actually a constant
Red_3D#3062: gcc with .cpp has MyMind as 1
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Red_3D#3062: thats why g++ does not like it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: you defined it outside the global scope <[newline]> in which case I don't know
ForLoveOfCats#4111: actually
Red_3D#3062: oh no
ForLoveOfCats#4111: btw Red that is technically UB lol
Red_3D#3062: can also compile c++
Red_3D#3062: gcc = gnu compiler collection
RyanT#1426: oh
Red_3D#3062: gnu c++ compiler
RyanT#1426: g++??!!
Red_3D#3062: I changed MyMind
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: gcc with c has no such weakness
Red_3D#3062: hahahha
Red_3D#3062: ofc g++ does not allow me to
Red_3D#3062: duck
ForLoveOfCats#4111: üëÄ
Red_3D#3062: as always
Red_3D#3062: I stole it
Red_3D#3062: nah
ForLoveOfCats#4111: wait was that not you?
Red_3D#3062: tell the one who made the meme
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's not, I double checked before bringing it up lmao
Red_3D#3062: hey
Broyojo#2667: I do not know c++
Broyojo#2667: don't know if that is ok
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Hey Red I think you forget to specify the type :P
Broyojo#2667: add `#define const bool`
RyanT#1426: your not my mom/dad
Red_3D#3062: I
RyanT#1426: says who?
Red_3D#3062: thats not allowed
RyanT#1426: simple, edit the code to say <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> bool MY_MIND = true; <[newline]> MY_MIND = false; <[newline]> ```
Broyojo#2667: shrink yourself down to the nanoscale level and manually change the individual bits in memory
Red_3D#3062: now i will have to think of something else
Red_3D#3062: dont steal my idea
Red_3D#3062: hey
Broyojo#2667: ~~overwrites that region in memory illegally~~
Red_3D#3062: 
DanielGJ44#4557: :O
Red_3D#3062: coincidence?
DanielGJ44#4557: Exactly 2 weeks after mine
Red_3D#3062: thank you Daniel
Red_3D#3062: you are forgiven
DanielGJ44#4557: Happy birthday on the 25th of May!
Red_3D#3062: huh, I never mentioned that before
Red_3D#3062: sadly not, its the 25 of may
Saltypretzel#0321: your birthday is R E D 3 D
Nik#1011: in brain memory or my calendar
Red_3D#3062: sad
Nik#1011: I do not have it saved
Red_3D#3062: but do you remember my birthday?
Red_3D#3062: you're good
Nik#1011: that's my proof
Red_3D#3062: darn
Nik#1011: now I know this much: `3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937`
Nik#1011: I just memorized a few more
Nik#1011: hey guys
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Saltypretzel#0321: 30 or 40 idk
Saltypretzel#0321: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937
Saltypretzel#0321: I know 40 ish
Nik#1011: only knowing 12 pfshhhhh
Nik#1011: I knew daniel was the odd one out
Red_3D#3062: probably more then you are ever gonna need
Nik#1011: 2 more than daniel
RyanT#1426: I only know `3.1415926535897` lol
Red_3D#3062: :(
Nik#1011: so I only know 25
Nik#1011: I used to know 53 digits of pi, but there's a part in the middle I always struggled with, so I could only confidently do 25. but then over time since I only kept using 25, I've now completely forgotten the next 28
DanielGJ44#4557: Sad!
Red_3D#3062: I dont even know my phone number
Red_3D#3062: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: Which is only a few digits longer than my license number which I also have memorized
DanielGJ44#4557: Longest number I have memorized is my credit card plus expiry plus cvv
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Holy digits batman!
Red_3D#3062: I still know 60 digits
Red_3D#3062: I was wrong
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I only know pi to three digits lmao
Red_3D#3062: 
DanielGJ44#4557: So for someone in my field knowing 12 is a feat lol
DanielGJ44#4557: Honestly mechanical engineering involves approximating gravity to 10 and pi to 3 a lot
Red_3D#3062: ah pi, got 50 digits of that
Nik#1011: but seriously I would be surprised if only half or less of the active members here knew more than 12 digits of pi
Red_3D#3062: you cant just push the meme up while I am working on this
Nik#1011: jkjk
Nik#1011: I'm more mad that you only know 12 digits
Nik#1011: >:(
Red_3D#3062: hey
DanielGJ44#4557: I typed out pi from memory (about 12 digits, so nearly the precision of a double) and was marked wrong on an assignment
DanielGJ44#4557: Lol
Nik#1011: fuck I did an int lmao
DanielGJ44#4557: const double PI = 4*atan(1) was what I had to use
Nik#1011: fixed
Nik#1011: `int const pi = 3.14;`
DanielGJ44#4557: It was the inverse of something times something
DanielGJ44#4557: I'd have to find what it was
RyanT#1426: WHAT??!!
DanielGJ44#4557: There was a way in my programming class that they made me define pi using trigonometric functions since C++ doesn't have a PI constant
DanielGJ44#4557: So that's where my comment came from lol
RyanT#1426: 
DanielGJ44#4557: But any math in which I use pi like that, it giving me an actual number is completely useless
RyanT#1426: I was on exact
RyanT#1426: wait... nvm
DanielGJ44#4557: True
FacePox#2708: well...
RyanT#1426: it can just use the approximately equals instead of the normal equals
RyanT#1426: even if it's not exact it still does this
DanielGJ44#4557: That's the only way to give that exact answer so I guess kinda correct lol
Nik#1011: ty calculator
FacePox#2708: cause it's set to exact
Nik#1011: lmao
RyanT#1426: cheating much
DanielGJ44#4557: How am I to function
DanielGJ44#4557: I don't know what any of that means
Nik#1011: <@!284602593597194250> üëÄ
Nik#1011: if you feel like you comfortably understand this meme then you know enough english to function in an english-speaking society properly
Nik#1011: I feel like this is a good english test
FacePox#2708: 
ForLoveOfCats#4111: This is where the MacOS style of having each executable be a runable folder with all its stuff shoved inside is really intriguing
ForLoveOfCats#4111: imo portable != single file. I plan on distributing Superb Text as a portable executable but even it is going to have to have some other files for stuff like configuration (I have some plans on how to make this as user friendly as possible). I do agree that that could have just been a normal zip and allowed the user the manually unpack it
Nik#1011: and it feels so wrong
Nik#1011: so you take off *just* your shorts to go get pants
Nik#1011: but realize you're wearing shorts and it's cold outside
Nik#1011: that feeling when you put on shoes and all your other stuff
Red_3D#3062: thats kinda broken
Red_3D#3062: welp
Red_3D#3062: Qdirstat gang
Nik#1011: kinda sad
Nik#1011: windows tools are more often than not gross stuff like this lmao
Nik#1011: well that's fun
Nik#1011: ok
Red_3D#3062: ew
Nik#1011: gross lol
Nik#1011: with images like this
Nik#1011: it seems like WinDirStatPortable.exe is a launcher of some kind
Nik#1011: and it's fully functional
Nik#1011: and inside that folder is windirstat.exe
Red_3D#3062: doesn't sound right
Red_3D#3062: that
Nik#1011: you can delete literally everything except /app/WinDirStat
Nik#1011: but
Nik#1011: in the root directory of this folder is WinDirStatPortable.exe
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Nik#1011: this is the folder it unpacked
Red_3D#3062: oh no
Nik#1011: is all this shit
Nik#1011: the hell
Red_3D#3062: could be
Nik#1011: I wouldn't be surprised if it puts entries in your registry
Nik#1011: definitely
Red_3D#3062: maybe just a poor choice of words
Nik#1011: ugh
Red_3D#3062: that does not look like the 7zip thing
Nik#1011: because it's a portable
Nik#1011: it's not instgalling anything
Nik#1011: when
Nik#1011: it still calls itself an installer
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Nik#1011: but
Nik#1011: you're correct, no admin
Nik#1011: 
Red_3D#3062: since it is literally just decompressing and writing data
Red_3D#3062: id guess not
Nik#1011: lemmi go find it and see if it requires admin privs
Red_3D#3062: it will not install anything
Red_3D#3062: 7zip auto unpacking
Red_3D#3062: thats just
Red_3D#3062: ah
Nik#1011: and unpacked it
Nik#1011: *fuck that*
Nik#1011: so I was like
Nik#1011: the portable version
Nik#1011: it just asks you where you want to extract
Red_3D#3062: I used that
Nik#1011: idk
Red_3D#3062: why
Red_3D#3062: what
Nik#1011: a fucking installer
Nik#1011: is
Nik#1011: the windirstat portable version
Nik#1011: unrelated
Red_3D#3062: ye
Nik#1011: btw
Red_3D#3062: so even if you didnt use the installer
Nik#1011: I'd hope
Red_3D#3062: "by using this software"
Red_3D#3062: dont most licenses be like
Nik#1011: is it still legally binding
Nik#1011: and therefore never agree to it
Nik#1011: and never see the license
Nik#1011: if you go around the installer
Red_3D#3062: is probably not gonna help ya
Red_3D#3062: knowingly removing just the notice of the data stuff
Red_3D#3062: the software itself is probably also licensed in such a way that includes usage of any kind
Nik#1011: yay gray areas
Red_3D#3062: idk
Red_3D#3062: without you agreeing
Red_3D#3062: since it do be doing that
Red_3D#3062: that might be an issue
Red_3D#3062: "we can collect data"
Red_3D#3062: if there is some random crap about
Red_3D#3062: but then
Red_3D#3062: except use it yourself
Red_3D#3062: you still could not do anything with it
Red_3D#3062: in which case
Red_3D#3062: maybe it might count as unlicensed
Red_3D#3062: well
Red_3D#3062: yee
Red_3D#3062: even if you went around it
Nik#1011: mhm cuz it's not your software
Red_3D#3062: but you would probably still have to comply to the license
Red_3D#3062: exactly
Nik#1011: without checkign the checkbox or whatever
Red_3D#3062: yes
Nik#1011: like you can unpack software installers a lot of the time and manaully install software
Red_3D#3062: they could copy your stuff
Red_3D#3062: gotta make sure they dont have access to it without agreeing
Nik#1011: not as scary?
Red_3D#3062: but
Red_3D#3062: yes, I think it is
Nik#1011: and not having to bother the user otherwise
Nik#1011: wouldn't it be just as legally binding if you just said "By continuing to use this software you are agreeing to our EULA"
Nik#1011: yea honestly I don't like the installation checkboxes  / stickers / whatever that say stuff like that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: 
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah. Definitely think the length is the most contributing factor
Verlio_H#0201: would have been fine if they did to the part where he eats the burger, then they do some sort of transition to the end part
DanielGJ44#4557: I suppose one company is being garbage for low effort ads and the other is being garbage for making a garbage ad
DanielGJ44#4557: With the no copyright drum beat
DanielGJ44#4557: CAN ALSO BE ENJOYED HERE
DanielGJ44#4557: THE SAME PLATE YOU GET HERE
DanielGJ44#4557: Or the
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean the doordash ads are equally garbage in the opposite way with a no copyright sound beat track and a plate rotating at like 6RPM in jagged stop motion
DanielGJ44#4557: When I said similar composition I wasn't really reading as deeply into it as animation style as I don't believe that's the reason the Sprite Cranberry one was liked
DanielGJ44#4557: Yeah I figured it was overstaying its welcome
Verlio_H#0201: also the unecesary length
Deleted User#0000: i don't like that the hair looks like real hair on a clearly non human face / body
Deleted User#0000: but the animation style
Deleted User#0000: like the whole concept is cringe
Deleted User#0000: you know what i hate the most about the animation style specifically
Dragon Lord#6944: The people that it's targeting are parents of young children and young children, which leaves a very large gap in the middle of people that just don't like it.
Dragon Lord#6944: The animation style is much different, and almost exactly like the animation style in illumination animations. My guess is that it reminds people too much of things like hotel Transylvania 2 and the like.
DanielGJ44#4557: Maybe this one overstays its welcome a tiny bit more
DanielGJ44#4557: I mean the am Sprite Cranberry ad is pretty well revered and this one is apparently garbage despite them being pretty similar in composition
PseudoGoose#2841: Imagine seeing ads
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Though to be fair I've only seen the ad once so it's not too bad
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's not great, but it's certainly not quite the same level of annoying or cringe as some others
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't really get all the hate on the grubhub ad
That Guy#1215: i should of done crowbar swings on the person with the salad
That Guy#1215: Militarily grunts just yelling
Dragon Lord#6944: my only gripe: should have done **CLANGCLUNGCLACLACLUNGCLUNGCLASH** on the words on the end
That Guy#1215: Here it is with half life SFX
That Guy#1215: 
Dragon Lord#6944: oh no
That Guy#1215: and i made it worse :>)
That Guy#1215: is so bad
That Guy#1215: ad*
That Guy#1215: grub hub add
That Guy#1215: fuckin
That Guy#1215: so
That Guy#1215: alright
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Gnilux

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Now that I say that it kinda sounds like heaven after death and I don't like that
Deleted User#0000: uwu
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Like here I wouldn't plant my face in a pole, I'd just go through the pole and randomly get teleported to somewhere else
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Whenever I eventually "fail" though, nothing really happens
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't have them often, but they're always annoying when they happen
Red_3D#3062: yep, exactly
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: They start weird and pretty nice but whenever your brain decides to think "wouldn't it be a shame if..." Things go wrong and it just keeps getting worse
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I have those dreams sometimes
Red_3D#3062: but I was scared af
Red_3D#3062: it was not hard do do
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Or was it just easily swinging from left to right, rather than holding on for dear life so you don't smack into a pole or something
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Also that "flinging from one to another", i assume that had some kind of stressful environment?
Red_3D#3062: he chewed on it a bit longer
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Random can indeed be very funny
PseudoGoose#2841: https://i.imgur.com/FzUSIwz.gif
Red_3D#3062: lol, thx
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: > they were interviewed but elon just ate the microphone <[newline]> Even in your sleep your comedy is great
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That's gotta be one of the best transitions I've seen to date
Red_3D#3062: This happens sometimes, but the last one was over a year ago.
Nik#1011: I find this more relatable than when most people talk about their dreams
Nik#1011: your dreams flow exactly like mine do though
Nik#1011: I've never dreamed about LW I think

Nik#1011: that's hilarious that bobby appeared and you hugged yours

Red_3D#3062: I just think it's strange that I had this dream now, after all this time of normale dreams
Red_3D#3062: After going down some stairs that definitely didn't exist before we got to the waiting Plattform thing were the dude just disappeared. Empty trains were just passing by every few seconds. Then I heard a familiar voice, I went a bit into the tunnel and found a few friends standing there, we decided to try taking a train. We went back to that platform and the trains continued to pass by. After some time they got less frequent and at some point a single train passed after like 3min. We decided to just grab onto it, it had some cargo stuff on the back (later I found it that it transformed into a cargo train) we could grip onto. I remember holding onto a metal piece and constantly having to use my arms to fling myself from one to another because there were metal poles next to the track that would hit me otherwise, I had the brilliant idea to go to the front where there was one of these big lights, but that was too hot to keep standing in front of so back to flinging myself to those grips for a few minutes. When we finally got to another empty train station we could finally see the driver of the train, looked pretty weird and was staring at us. After we jumped of the door opened, a Buch of tiny bobby's (20cm diameter) appeared and entered the train. There also was the bobby I use in the beta (red with a black face), it was about 50cm in diameter and at eye level with me. My hands went over it's smooth and soft outer shell and I woke up after hugging it. <[newline]>  <[newline]> This was the strangest dream I had in a while and I am glad bobby pulled me out of it
Red_3D#3062: My dreams were ducking weird tonight, I was in a amusement park with some friends and we did random stuff, but then there was something‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I remember that many famous people were there, I specifically remember Elon musk, Angela Merkel and some random "soccer" player. They were interviewed but Elon just ate the microphone. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Then there was this weird subway station. For some reason I went down there and found this long well lit tunnel I walked through, after a few minutes I ended up in a large cave. There was one of those cat caterpillars so I took that and drove back through the tunnel. At some point the tunnel was too small and steep for it so I continued by fricking flying the rest of the way while eating cheese. When I was in that weird subway station again everything was green and wet and full of dirt. It was also full of short tunnels and I could not find an exit. After running through them for a while I found this strange bunker full of glass tubes with some sort of important crystals, they were glowing blue. Then, finally, after I walked away from that thing I saw the entrance to the subway again. Someone was running down there so for some reason I just followed them.

Red_3D#3062: All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
Verlio_H#0201: Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.
Red_3D#3062: The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.
Verlio_H#0201: Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.
Red_3D#3062: There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Verlio_H#0201: Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
Red_3D#3062: Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it.
Verlio_H#0201: but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Red_3D#3062: Linux is not an operating system unto itself
Verlio_H#0201: or as I recently taken to calling it gnu + linux
Dragon Lord#6944: Oh yeah, because it's GNU/LINUX! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Dragon Lord#6944: Wait... A triangle with an arm going in and an arm coming out? Like a prism? Your favorite color is rainbow?
Nik#1011: color of the alphabet is not the same as a regular color
Dragon Lord#6944: Oh! Your favorite color is a triangle with two arms! I see what you're saying now.
Nik#1011: idk what you're not getting about this
Nik#1011: my favorite color of the alphabet is spelled "4"

Verlio_H#0201: there is a mathmatical function that aproximates factorial and as it aproaches 0 it aproaches 1

Deleted User#0000: <@!119734190571913216> 0! = 1 for the same reason that x^0 = 1 {x!=0}

MiniStumpy#5653: Ohhhhhhhhhhh I remember these
Stenodyon#8192: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: now that's neat
PseudoGoose#2841: and whatever that DA15 connector is doing there, idk
PseudoGoose#2841: look at those fat pci pins
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ok now that's just plain cool
PseudoGoose#2841: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Sblive%21.jpg
PseudoGoose#2841: for whatever reason, me or my dad had that card laying around
PseudoGoose#2841: I think I put a soundblaster in mine at one point
PseudoGoose#2841: ü§£
PseudoGoose#2841: AND THE PCI SLOTS
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I think it's so that the fan could be made really big and spin at a low rpm to reduce noise
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Highlighted for anyone who hasn't seen one of these in person, all of that is the CPU fan and shroud
PseudoGoose#2841: that psu is an absolute unit
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I think this one would, but it has a tray which is not very easy to use sideways lol
PseudoGoose#2841: yeah
ForLoveOfCats#4111: The DVD drive?
PseudoGoose#2841: i guess it doesn't work sideways?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's like half the computer!
PseudoGoose#2841: oh right, was about to ask
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Had to mount the DVD drive with bread ties because I had to run the whole system on its side to accommodate the GPU
PseudoGoose#2841: that dang CPU shroud
PseudoGoose#2841: niiice yeah I remember that üòÑ
ForLoveOfCats#4111: mine on the floor with its guts hanging out
PseudoGoose#2841: 2018/2019 ish
PseudoGoose#2841: this is the one I built a few years ago
PseudoGoose#2841: hehe well it's not
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Wow, I would not identify that as an optiplex at first glance
PseudoGoose#2841: There's mine, hiding in the corner
ForLoveOfCats#4111: but the damn CPU shroud is so huge and because the whole system is mirrored the card is in the wrong orientation relative and uggg
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Like, it has enough slots on the IO shield to fit the card
PseudoGoose#2841: Mine had that too!
ForLoveOfCats#4111: You just gave a name to what was one of the most frustrating things about that old system for me üòÜ
PseudoGoose#2841: it's mirrored, kinda
PseudoGoose#2841: it's the BTX form factor
PseudoGoose#2841: YES
PseudoGoose#2841: I think mine was 4GB DDR3. From that I went to a ThinkStation with a crappy power-hungry Xeon and 8GB, eventually got an RX 460. <[newline]> One year into college I built my own, with a 1st gen Ryzen, SSD, and eventually RX 580. I still use it now
ForLoveOfCats#4111: mine specifically has the motherboard on the opposite side from most PCs which caused issues mounting the GPU as it would hit the absolutely massive CPU fan shroud, I had to run it in a cardboard box and a PCI-E riser cable lol
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Those old Optiplexs are strange beasts but for how cheap and plentiful they are ü§∑
ForLoveOfCats#4111: the R7 360 and SSD are now in this new system
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Eventually plopped a SATA SSD in there too
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It was old when I got it. Over the following years I plopped a Core 2 Quad in it, doubled the memory, added a Radeon R7 360 and used Win10 for a while (back in technical preview and then at launch) before moving to Linux
ForLoveOfCats#4111: The system I just moved out of was an Optiplex. Shipped with 2 GB DDR3 a dual core Pentium (forgot the model) and Vista Basic
PseudoGoose#2841: that thing had a core 2 duo in it :]
PseudoGoose#2841: I think it was the first time I got Win7
PseudoGoose#2841: that was one of my first pcs
PseudoGoose#2841: I had a dell optiplex, and slapped a radeon hd6570 in there
MiniStumpy#5653: Imma nub
MiniStumpy#5653: I have a gtx 950 loll
MetalQueer#2283: my brother is still using his
MetalQueer#2283: my sister and brother also got dell computer but my sister upgraded hers
MetalQueer#2283: was pretty poggers
MetalQueer#2283: had a gtx 1060ti in it
MetalQueer#2283: I used to have a dell optiplex tower

Jimmy#8080: I love how you just casually mention "GTA RP servers", an entire culture I have never even heard of but which is certainly rich and full of history. I always get this strange feeling of awe and wonder when people do that
Jimmy#8080: Interesting!
PseudoGoose#2841: there probably are but don't quote me. I just know that it is a law on GTA RP servers because the custom horns aren't "legit" / realistic
DanielGJ44#4557: Unless they did and the way they're advertising it is misleading
DanielGJ44#4557: There most certainly will be now, tesla should have gone the route of having a horn soundboard/secondary one on the screen and the main one be unchangeable
Deleted User#0000: "Oh, and before I forget. I think you dropped this back in Black Mesa. Good luck out there, buddy. You're gonna need it."
Deleted User#0000: "Hey Gordon! The Citadel's on full alert! I've never seen it lit up like that. Get out of City 17 as fast as you can, Gordon! Take the old canals, right? They'll get you to Eli's lab. It's a dangerous route, but there's a whole network of refugees and they'll help you if they can. I'd come with you, but I've got to look after Dr. Kleiner."
Deleted User#0000: i'm sure this will be very funny to mister jimbo
Deleted User#0000: uh... who copied who?
Deleted User#0000: speaking of video game quotes i was about to reference
Dragon Lord#6944: *moan sound effect*
Deleted User#0000: how about "I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store on the Citadel"
Deleted User#0000: how about "skyrim belongs to the nords"
Deleted User#0000: how about "stop! you have violated the law"
Deleted User#0000: how about "do you get to the cloud district"

Deleted User#0000: sound*
Deleted User#0000: can i upload a scout that, when i try to amplify it further in audacity, it just shows "Infinity" as the suggested amplitude?
Deleted User#0000: and also make it dischordant
Deleted User#0000: and have it max amplitude
Deleted User#0000: the frequency humans perceive as the loudest
Deleted User#0000: can i make it like
Deleted User#0000: also how loud can i make it
Deleted User#0000: *only use horn when you want people to stop*
Deleted User#0000: *replaces horn sound with filthy frank it's time to stop*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Rickroll people when you hit the horn
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That sounds unsafe
CrispyPin#1149: *replaces horn sound with horny sound*
Jimmy#8080: You want a horn sound that is instantly recognizable as "this is serious, be alert now!"
Jimmy#8080: Seems like it could be a safety issue
Jimmy#8080: Huh, I'm surprised there are no regulations about horn sounds that prevent custom sounds
PseudoGoose#2841: https://tenor.com/zzOK.gif

Jimmy#8080: One of my internet friends in Puerto Rico might be taking a trip to canada in 2021, and if she does I'd see her then... that'd be the first time
Jimmy#8080: I have never met one of my internet friends IRL
FacePox#2708:

Red_3D#3062: I am pretty sure I cant directly get your address or something, but I could approximate it with the status messages or see other information about it
Red_3D#3062: depends on what you consider safe
Red_3D#3062: well
Nik#1011: and if it isn't I still trust this community
Nik#1011: yes I'm pretty sure it's safe to do that
Nik#1011: it was a few bucks I don't feel like getting it back tbh
Stenodyon#8192: oof I hope you got your shipping money back

Red_3D#3062: Bro, did you just seriously leak your tracking number?

FacePox#2708: anyone here play eve?
PseudoGoose#2841: ok i see the problem now
PseudoGoose#2841: oh hmm
DustyAngel47#7299: was it trained on hexadecimal though
PseudoGoose#2841: if gpt can understand html syntax (it can, right)? then why not other formats
PseudoGoose#2841: but like
PseudoGoose#2841: maybe hexadecimal would be better because each byte corresponds to its own 2 bytes in the encoding, instead of bytes sharing characters like in base64
PseudoGoose#2841: eh maybe not so well
DustyAngel47#7299: but how well would it work?
DustyAngel47#7299: we could try that
DustyAngel47#7299: hmm
PseudoGoose#2841: so turn it into base64
RyanT#1426: also, good luck waiting
DustyAngel47#7299: hooray
DustyAngel47#7299: and it didn't finish copying

ForLoveOfCats#4111: 
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Then I saw this
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I was like, "only a million views? I thought it was more influential than that"
DustyAngel47#7299: ikr

Red_3D#3062: I have no clue
DustyAngel47#7299: lol
DustyAngel47#7299: why did that song even become so popular
DustyAngel47#7299: the absolute internet classic
Red_3D#3062: aka combine them
Red_3D#3062: then do the pen pineapple apple pen move
DustyAngel47#7299: thats better
DustyAngel47#7299: ok
Red_3D#3062: then have another ai that finds the best image for that text
DustyAngel47#7299: thats boring
DustyAngel47#7299: but
DustyAngel47#7299: oh
Red_3D#3062: no, just generate the text
DustyAngel47#7299: i dont think gpt can train on binary data
DustyAngel47#7299: well
Red_3D#3062: we going png my dude
Red_3D#3062: ppm?
Red_3D#3062: I already have too much to do
DustyAngel47#7299: BRB let me get the ppm converter
Red_3D#3062: no
Red_3D#3062: no

DustyAngel47#7299: and of course the pkgbuild for citra fails at the end
RyanT#1426: Nintendo DS?
DustyAngel47#7299: nvm
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Wat?
DustyAngel47#7299: v*bleep*m?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ooop nope, 300 kb/s
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I just compiled melonDS and am waiting on a download of the BIOS files at legit 500 kb/s
DustyAngel47#7299: am now compiling citra because why not
Verlio_H#0201: I am  now playing mario kart 64 because why not
DustyAngel47#7299: iirc
DustyAngel47#7299: at least
DustyAngel47#7299: when the best emulator for a system is a 5 dollar app on the playstore
Verlio_H#0201: the only emulator I have is openemu
ForLoveOfCats#4111: You need a BIOS dump (like a number of other consoles being emulated) but until very recently all the emulators are rather shit
DustyAngel47#7299: switch*
DustyAngel47#7299: and/or actually try modding my wii
ForLoveOfCats#4111: The NDS is stupidly annoying to emulate
DustyAngel47#7299: to find them
DustyAngel47#7299: and i cant be fucked to look on `insert legally obtained games website here`
ForLoveOfCats#4111: which have also started posting really cool deep dive blog posts
DustyAngel47#7299: however that requires files to run
DustyAngel47#7299: yes
ForLoveOfCats#4111: There's also Yuzu (same core devs)
DustyAngel47#7299: slightly less 2005 looking
DustyAngel47#7299: but
DustyAngel47#7299: same vibe
DustyAngel47#7299: https://citra-emu.org/
DustyAngel47#7299: unrelated: why did it search in google i should have it set to search in ddg

RyanT#1426: its a wii emu i think
DustyAngel47#7299: a pretty chad wii emulator
Verlio_H#0201: motion  controls cool sometimes
Verlio_H#0201: what the hell is dolphin
DustyAngel47#7299: but fuck motion controls tho
DustyAngel47#7299: imagine not having your wii plugged in 24/7
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Especially when it would be more comfortable to play in Dolphin on my PC
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've honestly not attempted to get Wiimmfi setup because I know I'll just get clobbered online and getting the Wii out to play is in itself a massive pita
DustyAngel47#7299: i've been mostly on the homebrew/backing up side
DustyAngel47#7299: i still havent delved into that side of wii softmodding
DustyAngel47#7299: lmao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Most of my pain has been trying to get *illicitly acquired* software running (an old Animal Crossing for my sister), You need specific version of the OS to get the launchers working and getting the correct version of the OS installed is a massive pain in the rear
Red_3D#3062: I thought you didn't get it
Red_3D#3062: then why are we still talking about this
DustyAngel47#7299: The Homebrew Channel
DustyAngel47#7299: have you heard of
DustyAngel47#7299: No
Red_3D#3062: Nintendo killed servers
DustyAngel47#7299: i still havent done wiimmfi yet so i wouldnt know
Verlio_H#0201: fuckjkks
DustyAngel47#7299: and
DustyAngel47#7299: thats easy
Red_3D#3062: You can't just play online anymore
DustyAngel47#7299: or the homebrewing in general
DustyAngel47#7299: the wiimmfi
DustyAngel47#7299: really?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: it's kinda a pain to deal with
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've soft modded the family Wii a year or so ago
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Dumping one is significantly harder than generating it iirc
DustyAngel47#7299: this post made by wii master race
Verlio_H#0201: Ialso have mario kart wii but I dont use wii veri often
DustyAngel47#7299: imagine doing that
DustyAngel47#7299: well how convienent i actually have a wii instead of having to generate one online
DustyAngel47#7299: thats a certified gamer classic
DustyAngel47#7299: fuck yea
Red_3D#3062: or else
ForLoveOfCats#4111: You can play it, but to be able to connect to the Wiimmfi servers you need to generate an identifier (I is slow to respond, was looking up the spelling of Wiimmfi lol)
Red_3D#3062: rn
Red_3D#3062: play
Red_3D#3062: What, you have mk wii?
DustyAngel47#7299: i'll just use my wii for online lol
DustyAngel47#7299: well
DustyAngel47#7299: i am blind
DustyAngel47#7299: > online
Red_3D#3062: but you can just play offline for now
DustyAngel47#7299: OH
DustyAngel47#7299: i think
DustyAngel47#7299: i have played mkwii in dolphin without doing that before
Red_3D#3062: There are community servers still running
DustyAngel47#7299: wait what part 2
DustyAngel47#7299: well they say, and i quote `To start playing commercial games, yuzu needs a couple of system files and folders from your switch in order to play them properly. To check if your Switch is hackable, visit https://damota.me/ssnc/checker and test your Switch‚Äôs serial number.`
ForLoveOfCats#4111: You also need a special file to play MKWII and others online but you can generate that
Red_3D#3062: I don't have it on me atm, sry
DustyAngel47#7299: interesting
Red_3D#3062: For some nsps you need a special key file, but that should not be hard to find online
Verlio_H#0201: f
DustyAngel47#7299: my o3ds is currently busted
DustyAngel47#7299: well
Verlio_H#0201: imagine playing mario kart in  an emulator
DustyAngel47#7299: has this been a recent development
DustyAngel47#7299: wait what, dont you need files for the switch emus?
DustyAngel47#7299: source: hasnt played double dash
DustyAngel47#7299: because switching players
DustyAngel47#7299: but that had a strategy to it
Red_3D#3062: You don't need any special files for cemu,dolphin,yuzu
DustyAngel47#7299: yes
Red_3D#3062: You ever heard of double dash?
Verlio_H#0201: and it has 2 item slotss  which is dumb
DustyAngel47#7299: i dont need all of horizonos lol
DustyAngel47#7299: the ones that i need to run the emulators
Verlio_H#0201: but see mariokart 8 removes a lot of stragety
Red_3D#3062: what do you need
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~send files~~
Red_3D#3062: I have one
DustyAngel47#7299: and/or have not been looking in the right places online
DustyAngel47#7299: i just dont have a RCMable switch
Red_3D#3062: oh
DustyAngel47#7299: no
Red_3D#3062: Well, yuzu might stutter a bit or run slow in some sections
DustyAngel47#7299: imagine not running mk8d
DustyAngel47#7299: ok
Red_3D#3062: That should be able to run mk8 on cemu and mk wii on dolphin
DustyAngel47#7299: CPU: Ryzen 5 3500 <[newline]> GPU: GTX1650 Super
Red_3D#3062: It is quite nice with a usb controller
Red_3D#3062: Maybe you can run a emulator
DustyAngel47#7299: so obviously i think its bets
Red_3D#3062: send specs again
DustyAngel47#7299: apart from wii with motion controls
DustyAngel47#7299: mk7 is literally the only mk i have played
DustyAngel47#7299: but
Red_3D#3062: But having them is still nice
Red_3D#3062: the mk wii version of bikes are still the best
Red_3D#3062: like
Red_3D#3062: and mk7 does not even have bikes
Red_3D#3062: Mk8 just has much more interesting courses
DustyAngel47#7299: fuck there goes my counterpoints
Red_3D#3062: I have played both
DustyAngel47#7299: ~~source: has not played mk7?~~
Red_3D#3062: mk8 is better
Red_3D#3062: nah
Verlio_H#0201: I agree bbut I've played mario kart 8
DustyAngel47#7299: source: guy who hasnt played mario kart 8
DustyAngel47#7299: mario kart 7 > mario kart 8
Verlio_H#0201: mariokart 7  stream when
Jimmy#8080: I remain interested in that
DanielGJ44#4557: ah I was going to stream a complete playthrough of H-L wasn't I
Broyojo#2667: so yeah we are still not at the top
Broyojo#2667: on a tor window I get this sadly
Broyojo#2667: I see this when I search up logic world on an icognito window
DustyAngel47#7299: also we gotta overtake logic as the first result for `Logic World`
DustyAngel47#7299: wait i think youtube is kinda fucked up for me rn

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Mathematicians: it will happen at infinity <[newline]> Programmers: whenever my float feels like it
Red_3D#3062: it will happen *at the end* with perfect precision, it will happen pretty soon with limited precision but it will never happen if you ask them stupid humans
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: In theory it will happen, in reality it will not
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: **There is no end, just eternity of not staying together for more than a moment**
Red_3D#3062: and at the end, it has happened
Red_3D#3062: but kinda does
Red_3D#3062: it will never happen
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yes
Red_3D#3062: at the end
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: And when will that be?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Which will take infinitely long
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: They will, once they reach infinity
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: So they will never stay together
Red_3D#3062: yes, at infinity
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: So they eventually do
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: They do so at infinity

FacePox#2708: 5 bucks
Nik#1011: How much does Santa pay to park his vehicle?
Dragon Lord#6944: Agreed
Nik#1011: I would rather mute someone spamming me than block them
Nik#1011: this is a mindset I can get behind
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (of which shitty bots are one)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I like that idea, but I do have my limits
Deleted User#0000: üò≥ yes
Dragon Lord#6944: As shadman once said, 'I have never blocked anyone; never will. Even my most egregious enemy should be able to contact me'.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: \x0
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I still didn‚Äôt really understand it at that time, but my reaction was roughly the same, though a few years back I started getting more and more involved with it, and I‚Äôm glad i reacted the way I did back then
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: and then a few years later on of my uncles came out as gay, and he‚Äôs currently married
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: because of that, one of them explained to me that she didn‚Äôt know either, but that they just liked each other
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I remember back in primary school (ages 4 to 11-ish) there was a girl couple, and quite a few classmates just kinda nagged them about it because it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù (can you blame the kids? they had probably never seen a same-sex couple before), and I didn‚Äôt really understand either, but my reaction was just to kinda ignore the couple (not the individuals, mind you), and that worked out pretty well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever done something online that would justify such a reaction towards me, as I‚Äôm generally quite ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù about things I don‚Äôt personally see the logic behind
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Neither of them I could have a human conversation with. It was all one-sided hate towards me, and I couldn‚Äôt figure out what they were actually getting at
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I believe two people?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Andd
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I have blocked one bot
Jimmy#8080: Sure, innocents get caught in the crossfire, but if your goal is to not be harassed it can be an effective technique
Jimmy#8080: But the point isn't to block people who won't have constructive conversation, the point is to block harassers
PseudoGoose#2841: All my homies use parler kappa

PseudoGoose#2841: Who needs twitter tbh
Deleted User#0000: who needs narrow when you have `THICC`
PseudoGoose#2841: Its just that it could be made narrower in scope
PseudoGoose#2841: But hey, it does effectively solve the problem
Deleted User#0000: sister: honey mustard pringles <[newline]> me: bringles prand money hustard
PseudoGoose#2841: 99% of harassers follow A, but that doesn't say anything (in and of itself) about what percentage of followers of A are harassers.
PseudoGoose#2841: Makes sense, but it also doesn't. P(X|Y) and P(Y|X) aren't correlated
Jimmy#8080: You may be a victim of that practice
Jimmy#8080: Some public figures in politics automatically block folks based on who they follow. It might seem like intentionally creating an echo chamber, but I can see the logic; if I'm getting harassed by dozens of people daily, and 99% of those people follow [public figure with opposing ideology], it kind of makes sense to auto-block anyone following [public figure with opposing ideology]

FacePox#2708: most of it is pretty left wing stuff too
DanielGJ44#4557: Some people have a mental breakdown if they see anything that doesn't agree with their politics on Twitter so that could be why
DanielGJ44#4557: I feel like I have a roughly equal personality both through text and in person
FacePox#2708: idk I retweet some political stuff
FacePox#2708: I'm much cleaner and less abrasive on twitter than I am in real life lol
DanielGJ44#4557: Huh
FacePox#2708: 30 people block me on twitter and I really don't know why
DanielGJ44#4557: Also I generally get content I can use against said person if I have to
DanielGJ44#4557: I generally don't block anyone as I have pretty thick skin and am pretty abrasive myself to the point where I can end a conflict
DanielGJ44#4557: LOL true
Verlio_H#0201: on discord I have an annoying ggirl from school blocked aand this guy who kept dmiing me random shit about a video game I told him i dont pplay aftter I told hiim to stop

Red_3D#3062: I only ever had to block 2 people

DanielGJ44#4557: I don't think I've blocked anyone on any social network/platform

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't like it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ```More interactive gameplay was developed for Part Two of Template Nibbler. This plays the game one step at a time, with each compile taking a single player input and computing a single frame. Because frames are computed individually, the compile time of each frame is low, often reaching very reasonable, single digit SPF (seconds per frame).```

Nik#1011: lmao this'll be ez.
Nik#1011: I'll just have 2 cups and ask someone to fill both of them so I don't have to ask many times through the day
AD#5988: fair
Nik#1011: I could but I don't like it lol
AD#5988: it probably doesn't have a bunch of dangerous lead in it
AD#5988: just use tap water
Nik#1011: my parents won't have filtered water
Nik#1011: steal it from the fridge lol
Nik#1011: I could
AD#5988: just get like a 2 liter jug of water
Nik#1011: yeah lol I work from home on a laptop
AD#5988: i'm trying to think of ways this can fail but i can not
Nik#1011: I hope she doesn't mind my stupid experiment
Nik#1011: hmm
Nik#1011: or refill my water etc.
Nik#1011: I'll ask my mom or something to bring me the food I already have in the fridge

Nik#1011: I can do literally everything else from bed technically.... I think it'd be funny to try
Nik#1011: except bathroom breaks are permitted
Nik#1011: so I've decided as of 5 minutes ago that tomorrow I'm going to do my whole live from bed for 1 day
FacePox#2708: well it's the most advanced math course they offer and there's like 15 kids in the class so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

DanielGJ44#4557: they're like, hey, lets make a kid do it for free
DanielGJ44#4557: so instead of training a teacher to do it
FacePox#2708: so I get to make these lectures every now and then
FacePox#2708: My high school doesn't have a teacher qualified to teach differential equations so the course is student lead
DanielGJ44#4557: In fact, the course I am currently in touches a bit on springs with regards to static and dynamic loading
DanielGJ44#4557: I remember doing those questions vividly

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The same way minecraft mods do
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: PA:T is a good example: many people play with a massive mod, which adds a lot of variety to the game's units, and does so in a fair way. I guess it is different in the way that this mod applies to everyone in a lobby/game, rather than one individual
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And besides that it depends on the game
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: You can see that people find modding purely singleplayer games to be completely fine
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But I play singleplayer or with friends, so it's fine imo
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Payday 2 doesn't know any real game-wide ban system. You can ban individuals, but that only applies to you
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I get why people see it as cheating, since payday is technically a multiplayer game. If you go any further than GUI, texture or model mods, people will immediately think of the large cheater peak that appeared when 5 million free copies were given away
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That mentality is also really well expressed with Minecraft mods
ForLoveOfCats#4111: All ~10 hours I have in it were with countless mods, invincibility, ect
ForLoveOfCats#4111: When I got Just Cause 2 on sale many years ago the first thing I did was mod the hell out of it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I do like your viewpoint on modifying singleplayer games to better enjoy it. I would go so far as to say that it is in no way cheating. A game generally exists to be enjoyable. With a singleplayer game if you are maximizing your enjoyment of it then you are just helping the game do its job :)
Deleted User#0000: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: With friends you could definitely muck around, get beaten into oblivion, and still have a lot of fun
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I also often played with strangers in my team, that certainly hasn't helped making teamkills enjoyable
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I guess that you like the unpredictability of online play, while I enjoy being able to modify the game exactly to my likings
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Not that I would be able to criticize such a personal opinion, but y'know
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well, a logical viewpoint
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That's also quite a...
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I didn't play to many video games when I was younger. We had a Wii that got turned on maybe once every few months. Eventually my sister and I both got DSs which were nice and got plenty of use as we were dragged around and spent tons of time in Dr offices and such (long story). However my main (as in most influential on my outlook) introduction to gaming as a medium was youtubers dicking around in private multiplayer matches of whatever random game they chose that day and having a hell of a time berating each other. That kinda cemented in my mind and I would point to it as a big reason for my outlook on gaming. I see gaming as largely a social thing, especially in this time of youtube/twitch/online multiplayer. PvP is just an extension of that. <[newline]>  <[newline]> I find it frustrating to play a section of a singleplayer game more than a few times, it really breaks my enjoyment of whatever work went into that area when I have to fight through it for the fifth identical time. A multiplayer game instead just keeps going even when you are respawning, time moves forward. Plus the random moments that just happen when players who don't know each other interact in various unexpected ways like making a truce with a specific player or you both kill each other and laugh about it in chat. Ultimately it is more rewarding to best real players than some annoying enemy with abusable AI. My most memorable gaming moments are these hard fought battles against players of similar skill and finally getting that last kill just before the time runs out and barely winning.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If you know them, that is
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Speaking of wich, what are the reasons you like pvp?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to get myself into pvp games again anytime soon, which is too bad
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It‚Äôs cheating, sure, but I‚Äôm not harming the experience of others and I found playing like this more rewarding (being careful can result in cleaning out every guard on the map), but also more challenging, because you only have a single ‚Äúloud‚Äù kill
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: On pve it‚Äôs trivial to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù by making some parts harder and others easier, and I found that to be very fun. For example: I always play with silent assassin. It allows for infinite stealth kills, but I set it so that I can only make one ‚Äúloud‚Äù kill (as opposed to the 4 total kills you normally get)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I think it might also be from the fact that I simply don‚Äôt like completely losing: if I know there‚Äôs a large chance I‚Äôll lose, I‚Äôll often just not do it or find a compromise
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That's an interesting point that I would agree with. The unpredictability makes it hard to avoid the parts of the game which you don't enjoy or frustrate you
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Teamkills, toxic teams, and the weird pressure to play well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I basically only played csgo and r6s before, and it was getting kinda stale, because while each match was unique, the same annoyances kept appearing, in a very unpredictable pattern
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I started playing payday 2 when I had a pretty massive pvp dip
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's interesting to hear a perspective on this that is so different from mine. I like multiplayer PvP games for exactly the opposite reason, the human element makes things more unpredictable and fresh keeping it from getting stale or routine
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But it's not really challenging by itself, I have to set restrictions on myself to make it challenging
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It feels like you're doing a dance through the levels and it's great
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I love pve cuz... Well, because of exactly this
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Loot spawns were mastered around 200 hours
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's gotten to the point that I know almost all possible enemy spawns
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Nah only pve
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: After 300 hours in the game, with the large majority playing stealth, I can exploit the shit out of it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's fun in it's own way
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Payday 2 stealth is the complete opposite
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Which ironically is part of the basis of that little fps game I'm building this month lol
ForLoveOfCats#4111: If you think about it, the ultimate stealth game is multiplayer with players instead of NPCs
PseudoGoose#2841: yeahh... I would totally play a stealth game with more realistic mechanics. It would be difficult as hell, but I think it would be fun. A higher awareness for noises, immediately being suspicious after noticing something, a wider field of view but with less chance of noticing things in the peripheral,

FacePox#2708: Expensive hot dogs imported from the Bavarian hamlet of schnitzelheim where they have been making them that way since the roman transalpine expansion.
Deleted User#0000: i like that on hotdogs
Deleted User#0000: also is there sauerkraut or not
Deleted User#0000: turkey bacon exists so surely turkey hot dogs must exist too
Deleted User#0000: do turkey hot dogs exist?
Deleted User#0000: turkey, beef or just regular `pork and chicken anomaly`
Deleted User#0000: <@!322937301846196224> what kind of hotdogs
FacePox#2708: <@456226577798135808> my mom said you could come over but since your the guest she wants to know if you want hotdogs or pizza
RyanT#1426: <@!154964593397989376>, does <#401255675264761868> use int64's?
Red_3D#3062: no int64 is in the file formats and they are not really that useful for games, Id say there is a ~79% chance of int64
Red_3D#3062: that is actually a good question
RyanT#1426: but Logic World prob. has at least 1 int64
Red_3D#3062: thats illegal
Red_3D#3062: no
Witness#6597: I can use int64
Red_3D#3062: if you use unix time you will be able to use the same timestamp (but -) by 2038

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Talk up patriotism and national ideals while undermining your supporter's view of everyone else in the system
ForLoveOfCats#4111: What scares me is not an armed takeover, I don't think the millitary would play ball with that. Instead the "soft" takeover where confidence in the general government is erroded to the point that supporters of an individual are willing to give them full control of the nation
Deleted User#0000: lmfao

Deleted User#0000: the comment is made
DanielGJ44#4557: if it makes you feel better he has committed to leaving the white house if the electoral college votes him out
DanielGJ44#4557: but I am more politically moderate so take that with a grain of salt
DanielGJ44#4557: so I'd imagine the "violent" part would need to be started and it also be January 21st without a successful transition of power

Deleted User#0000: also another thing i dislike about myself
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Relative to the last message
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: So
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Through text you often use "yeah I agree"
Deleted User#0000: what
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Before someone else can reply
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That way you can "intersect" the convo
Deleted User#0000: and that doesn't work
Deleted User#0000: but thru text
Deleted User#0000: it's like i'm trying to emulate the emphasis in my actual speech
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Cuz
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well
Deleted User#0000: like why the fuck do i put "and" on a separate message
Nik#1011: I've noticed the need to be funny thing too, I had another friend in the past who took it way too far tho
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: we she he me don't know why
Deleted User#0000: they don't know why
Deleted User#0000: idk why
Deleted User#0000: i'm randomly just a dick to people
Nik#1011: yeah splitting messages combined with talking more than others is a bad combo
Deleted User#0000: and
Deleted User#0000: i don't think i'm really funny or i try too hard to be funny
Deleted User#0000: and
Deleted User#0000: i've had people very upset with me about that
Deleted User#0000: i think people don't like that i split sentences up into multiple messages
Nik#1011: I used to use it way too much, I'm a bit better now but I still say like like a lot
Deleted User#0000: i think the main things i don't like about myself personality-wise is like
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *like* a lot a lot
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I use "like" a lot
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh I have one of those habits too
Nik#1011: understanding a problem is the first step to fixing it
Nik#1011: I disagree
Deleted User#0000: if that makes sense
Deleted User#0000: yeah but that's vague and not really helpful to help others help me (??)
Nik#1011: you could ask us for that as well
Deleted User#0000: what do i evene ask for help about
Deleted User#0000: but like
Deleted User#0000: this stupid habit i have of saying 'lmao' / 'lmfao' / 'xd' / etc. after me shitting on myself
Nik#1011: then here's my first suggestion to improve yourself: try not to feel bad asking for hekp
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: What if I ask you to ask
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well
Deleted User#0000: and
Deleted User#0000: i feel bad even asking lmfao
Deleted User#0000: yeah but like
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Regardless of being able to help, we'll at least try
Nik#1011: common social norms is for people to stay silent about advice to improve yourself. but this community is pretty good, I think if you ask for help we can suggest some things
Deleted User#0000: "i'm gonna leave server for 14 days again"
Deleted User#0000: into
Deleted User#0000: rewriting the "i'm gonna suicide" manipulation script
Deleted User#0000: how tf do you know i'm not just like
Nik#1011: if you were like "fuck everything guys I'm gonna suicide myself 200x times" then that's what I'd consider hunting for attention. this seems much more sincere
Nik#1011: I don't think talking about issues like this is "for attention"
Deleted User#0000: idfk
Deleted User#0000: "am i just doing this for attention because that just makes this even worse you piece of shit"
Deleted User#0000: and then you start complaining about it in the server and you wonder
Deleted User#0000: but like in your brain you are the only problem in the community and you've just been here for a while so it's hard for them to tell you to fuck off
Deleted User#0000: like people might say "repsi you're fine you just have heated gamer moments everyone does sometimes"
Deleted User#0000: and sometimes you don't even know if it's yourself or the community that is exiling you for being stupid
Deleted User#0000: pretty exactly yearly
Deleted User#0000: and by 'yearly' i mean
Deleted User#0000: 4. repeat
Deleted User#0000: 3. be exiled because you're a fuckin awful person
Deleted User#0000: 2. fuck things up and completely upset the balance of chillness
Deleted User#0000: 1. meet new group of chill people
Deleted User#0000: of like
Deleted User#0000: you ever feel like you have no drive to improve yourself or have no idea how to even go about doing that so everything's just a weird yearly cycle
Deleted User#0000: physical or not lmao
Deleted User#0000: you ever just wanna break shit
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000:

Deleted User#0000: now that's an epic gamer play
Deleted User#0000: <@456226577798135808>  please never @ me about this again
Verlio_H#0201: I think its more like 99.9
FacePox#2708: 
Nik#1011: it's not actually snow it's just bunny fur
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: so there's that
Nik#1011: no it's the easter bunny
Dragon Lord#6944: or wind
Verlio_H#0201: the only explaination is the giiant spagetti monster
Dragon Lord#6944: wind
Nik#1011: huh.
Nik#1011: ..............
Verlio_H#0201: checkmate aethiests, why is there snow on mount everest if its above the clouds
Dragon Lord#6944: yeah...
Nik#1011: so it's only natural for us to still be pretty stupid
Nik#1011: <@!282378798023049216> well if it helps, we only evolved juuuuuuuuuuuust enough to start taking over the world. Once we started, it became easier and easier to continue and we stopped evolving
Dragon Lord#6944: raven maybe... they got the smarts
Verlio_H#0201: I wish I was a bird
Dragon Lord#6944: a different reason, for sure, but I do wish that I didn't *have* to say I was strictly human.
Dragon Lord#6944: I often wish i weren't human just because I hate humanity, but don't want to be any other lifeform that is currently known to humans. Don't get me wrong, I have never met a person that I was capable of hating or wishing ill upon, but holy shit are we dumb and selfish fuckers.
Nik#1011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3-Y31ONZuI
Deleted User#0000: yes
Nik#1011: and your brain goes `-_-`
Nik#1011: so it's like those youtubers
Nik#1011: I just need to be agressive with my massaging
Deleted User#0000: feels like it'd just keep me awake lmao
Deleted User#0000: idk i mean maybe that'd help but i kinda doubt it
Deleted User#0000: owo
Nik#1011: owo
Nik#1011: what if I massaged you to sleep
Deleted User#0000: because i don't notice it as bad
Deleted User#0000: going to sleep during the day is nice too
Deleted User#0000: so like
Nik#1011: yeah
Deleted User#0000: night = quieter i guess
Deleted User#0000: it's only when i'm laying down that i notice it because like
Nik#1011: huh
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: it makes me feel like something is horribly wrong with my health
Nik#1011: is that something that bothers you frequently?
Deleted User#0000: i do not like feeling my heart beating in my extremities
Deleted User#0000: idk
Deleted User#0000: but i do that cause if i don't, then i start to focus too much on what i feel in my body and then like
Nik#1011: I don't believe you
Deleted User#0000: yeah but i'm not falling asleep yet
Nik#1011: you're thinking about ALL the things
Nik#1011: you're failing miserably
Deleted User#0000: i usually try to stay up long enough so i don't have to think about things before i sleep
Nik#1011: I do not like counting spiders
Nik#1011: I like imagining I'm a robot with a screen for a face, and my brain was scanned before I died just to be put in a superior robot body
Deleted User#0000: counting penises
Deleted User#0000: or counting spiders
Deleted User#0000: counting bears
Nik#1011: I like imagining my room is part of a centrifuge in a space station orbiting earth, and that the centrifuge only exists to put gravity in my room and make me feel comfortable
Deleted User#0000: what about
Deleted User#0000: or <insert animal>
Deleted User#0000: or cows
Deleted User#0000: or goats
Deleted User#0000: counting sheep
Nik#1011: there are a few things I like thinking about while trying to fall asleep.
Nik#1011: lol good
Deleted User#0000: yeah
Nik#1011: and not that you wish to stop living
Nik#1011: I hope you mean you wish to live without human traits
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: i do not like feeling it
Deleted User#0000: in all of my extremities
Deleted User#0000: and feeling my gross disgusting squishy heart beating
Deleted User#0000: like i don't like lying down in bed
Deleted User#0000: wish you didn't have a heartbeat
Deleted User#0000: you ever just like
Dragon Lord#6944: Oh, add 3 hour recordings of college seminars on neuromorphic computing to the second one.

Deleted User#0000: like you're even able to fall asleep listening to it
Deleted User#0000: and you can very easily ignore it
Deleted User#0000: it does not excite brain
Nik#1011: tbh it's what my brain is doing rn
Deleted User#0000: `-_-` in the sense that

Deleted User#0000: have oyu ever thought, nik
Deleted User#0000: they were fake ha ha but not really they exist
Deleted User#0000: you learned about imaginary numbers
Deleted User#0000: pranked, dumbass kids
Nik#1011: now go to bed
Deleted User#0000: and then later tell them
Nik#1011: I'm glad you wrote it down before you went to bed then
Deleted User#0000: teach children about imaginery numbers with colors
Deleted User#0000: i think this is a good idea
Deleted User#0000: the brain is good at visual pattern stuff
Nik#1011: it's scaring me
Nik#1011: you're behaving even more weird and sporadic than you already normally do
Nik#1011: repsiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Deleted User#0000: 5 quaternion thing
Deleted User#0000: 5 (semitransparent fuschia) =
Deleted User#0000: so like
Deleted User#0000: so you can have a bigger range of numbers
Deleted User#0000: have some scalar to multiply the whole color by
Deleted User#0000: and then like
Nik#1011: 3) go to sleep
Deleted User#0000: 0.0-1.0

Deleted User#0000: and then like
Deleted User#0000: green is the imaginary
Deleted User#0000: the real part
Deleted User#0000: red is like
Nik#1011: GO TO BED
Deleted User#0000: we should add colors together
Deleted User#0000: numbers are overrated
Nik#1011: the answer is aprox `0.0501256289`
Deleted User#0000: üò≥
Deleted User#0000: nah
Deleted User#0000: not anal
Deleted User#0000: no
Deleted User#0000: anal
Nik#1011: I have no clue what you actually meant
Deleted User#0000: anah
Nik#1011: the only thing I understand about that sentence is that you really need sleep
Deleted User#0000: kneek
Deleted User#0000: sleep is for the knee
Nik#1011: yes
Deleted User#0000: no
Nik#1011: get some rest

Nik#1011: you're just saying random stuff
Nik#1011: :(
Nik#1011: becuz you're not reading my messages
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: why are we even having this conversation
Deleted User#0000: i don't know
Nik#1011: back here
Deleted User#0000: they were really close roundinginignisngisngs
Nik#1011: I realized this already
Deleted User#0000: i didn't say they were exact because
Deleted User#0000: 0.0503...
Deleted User#0000: and
Deleted User#0000: 19.9498...
Deleted User#0000: i think it was really more like
Nik#1011: well why didn't you say they're not exact numbers earlier
Nik#1011: oh
Deleted User#0000: but those aren't exact numbers
Deleted User#0000: it's 19.95 and 0.05
Deleted User#0000: that is wrong
Deleted User#0000: that's -19.95
Deleted User#0000: no
Deleted User#0000: also
Nik#1011: I'm trying to answer `0=(k*k)-(20*k)+1`
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: we are talking about now
Deleted User#0000: what
Deleted User#0000: i'm not sure
Deleted User#0000: 19.95 and 0.05 are unrelated to the envelope problem because i forgot to divide the -20k by 10 in an earlier step
Nik#1011: where did you get that number
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: i'm really confused now
Deleted User#0000: what
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: 191.1915
Nik#1011: LMAO
Nik#1011: that was -19.95
Nik#1011: wait
Nik#1011: repsi did you see this pic
Deleted User#0000: parabole
Deleted User#0000: cause yknow
Deleted User#0000: the 19.95 thing
Deleted User#0000: or
Deleted User#0000: or,
Nik#1011: the answer to my version is aprox `k=0.05013`
Deleted User#0000: very boring
Deleted User#0000: 1 and 1
Deleted User#0000: the only solutions are obviouosly just
Deleted User#0000: it's kk-2k+1
Deleted User#0000: i forgot to divide the 20 by 10
Deleted User#0000: yeah no
Nik#1011: my math function is `=(k*k)-(20*k)+1`
Nik#1011: neither of the answers you provided were correct I think
Nik#1011: 0.00000000000015
Deleted User#0000: excel really excels at floating point mathematics
Nik#1011: that's not 0
Nik#1011: excel pls
Deleted User#0000: i'mtired dude
Deleted User#0000: repsi why are you getting mad at mathematical concepts
Deleted User#0000: dumb shit parabola
Deleted User#0000: those are the most interesting parabolas
Deleted User#0000: i really love when the discriminant is just 0
Deleted User#0000: boring
Deleted User#0000: but you're like
Deleted User#0000: yeah, parabola, you exist
Nik#1011: uh
Deleted User#0000: that's so boring
Deleted User#0000: is when the multiplier is 1
Deleted User#0000: the only time when the expected value is exactly equal to the first envelope
Deleted User#0000: that's so lame
Deleted User#0000: damn
Deleted User#0000: i am wrong
Deleted User#0000: kk-2k+1
Deleted User#0000: numbers
Deleted User#0000: but hey
Deleted User#0000: i have no idea how to interpret that back into the problem
Deleted User#0000: i am tired rn so
Deleted User#0000: yes
Nik#1011: 
Deleted User#0000: idk bro
Deleted User#0000: i'm dumb
Deleted User#0000: i think i did

Nik#1011: lmao
Nik#1011: I was trying to solve your thingy
Nik#1011: damnit repsi
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: no
Dragon Lord#6944: (10*2) - 10 = $+10 vs (10/2) - 10 = $-5 <[newline]> you have more to gain than to lose
Deleted User#0000: thonk
Deleted User#0000: k = 19.95 OR 0.05
Dragon Lord#6944: yes it is
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: YES
Deleted User#0000: kk - 20k + 1 = 0
Deleted User#0000: idk bro
Deleted User#0000: $10 or (5+20)/2 <[newline]> $10 vs $12.50 average

Broyojo#2667: I'll find some later
Broyojo#2667: we need some clean audio jimmy
Deleted User#0000: makes sense
Broyojo#2667: I think the heartbeats in these recordings is jimmy blowing into the mic or the wind blowing into the mic
Deleted User#0000: might try it later
Broyojo#2667: I'll stop doing this for now since I already  spend enough time
Deleted User#0000: ~~and that's the issue~~
Broyojo#2667: if you try
Broyojo#2667: It probably can
Deleted User#0000: unless it would run on google colab or similar
Deleted User#0000: I would try this, but chances are I can't run it because igpu
Broyojo#2667: 
Broyojo#2667: technically it only needs 5 seconds but really more is better I think
Broyojo#2667: with this git repo: https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning
Broyojo#2667: ai based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf
RyanT#1426: is the parts where its not speaking b/c it doesn't have that syllable?

Broyojo#2667: hmmm
Broyojo#2667: maybe artifacts
Broyojo#2667: I don't know what the heartbeats are
Buzz#6223: "im... gonna cum.... in my beard.... then shave it off"
Deleted User#0000: that sounds way better

ForLoveOfCats#4111: inb4 someone deepfakes me onto Jimmy's head

ForLoveOfCats#4111: In response to this
Deleted User#0000: turn audio into text and train gpt-2 on that audio and convert it back to audio
Verlio_H#0201: just find a clip of him saying each sylable

Red_3D#3062: wait a minute
Verlio_H#0201: beth is an ai
Verlio_H#0201: probably deep faked
Broyojo#2667: hopefully that's real jimmy and not deepfaked
Beth#0461: just so you know I'm not lying
Beth#0461: 
Broyojo#2667: ok I'll get to work
Beth#0461: <@!278221915787624448> Jimmy says yes
Red_3D#3062: uh, I think ima wait for jimmys full song
Broyojo#2667: from your youtube videos?
Broyojo#2667: hey <@!154964593397989376> do I have permission to replicate your voice?
RyanT#1426: are you gonna mention this?
Broyojo#2667: yeah true
Red_3D#3062: we probably have enough lww videos for that
Broyojo#2667: and put together a song or give to an ai to do it
Broyojo#2667: so you can extract mouth sounds
Broyojo#2667: how about you just ask jimmy to record a few minutes of him reading lots of sentences
Red_3D#3062: tbh, It would still be worth it
Verlio_H#0201: plot twist, jimmy is owner and he takes 99% of money
Jimmy#8080: Your donation will make the world better in a direct, real and tangible way
Jimmy#8080: PIH does amazing work, they are one of my favorite charities nowadays
Jimmy#8080: Bless!!

Jimmy#8080: If this community can collectively donate $20 to Partners in Health (https://www.pih.org/) I will release high-quality audio and video of me performing the entirety of Rick Astley's *Never Gonna Give You Up* (1987)
Red_3D#3062: I might be able to do something
Red_3D#3062: ok
RyanT#1426: <:bobby_sob:692807893023588363>
Red_3D#3062: I dont think it will be able to handle the whole video
Red_3D#3062: I only chose the ones under the bride because of color consistency.
Red_3D#3062: uh
RyanT#1426: can you add more lines to the dataset so we can see all the lines <@!520939910988038175> sent?
Red_3D#3062: sadly not
RyanT#1426: <:bobby_sob:692807893023588363> so you can't show us anymore of the true Jimmy roll?
Red_3D#3062: and only one of them happened to be in the deepfake dataset
Red_3D#3062: just a few lines
RyanT#1426: Did Jimmy send you him singing the whole song or just the first line?
Red_3D#3062: I considered doing some sort of audio deep fake, but eventually gave up on that
Broyojo#2667: it would be cool if you mimicked jimmy's voice through his videos
Red_3D#3062: the face is ai generated, yes.
Red_3D#3062: nah, the voice is a clip jimmy once send me
RyanT#1426: So you're trying to replace both the face and the voice of Rick Astley with Jimmy using AI?
Verlio_H#0201: lol
Red_3D#3062: haha, I forgot about this audio. <[newline]> sad that only this short segment is present in both.
Red_3D#3062: that is pretty cool

Dragon Lord#6944: <@!427964757492891649>, btw ^
Dragon Lord#6944: thank you, thank you! I'll be here all night
Dragon Lord#6944: ``` <[newline]>   SCP 100913-1 is a ficticious game refered to by SCP 100913-A and instances of SCP 100913-B as 'Logic World' or by the abbreviation 'LW'. It is described as 'a game about digital logic' by SCP 100913-A and instances of SCP 100913-B. SCP 100913-1 has been scheduled for release since at least march 2020, but SCP 100913-A and instances of SCP 100913-B are adamant that it has been scheduled for release much longer. It is unknown what a release of SCP 100913-1 would mean, but due to its fictitious nature, it is expected that the release of SCP 100913-1 would mean that the walls of reality are tearing and [REDACTED]. The release of SCP 100913-1 should be prevented at all costs. current efforts are mainly suggestions for SCP 100913-1 made to SCP 100913-A and instances of SCP 100913-B, prompting SCP 100913-A to spend more time on SCP 100913-1, thus delaying the release. <[newline]> ```
Dragon Lord#6944: ``` <[newline]>   SCP 100913-B are humans that have been exposed to the cognitohazardous effects of SCP 100913-A. These effects are mild for most, simply making them believe that SCP 100913-1 is real, but can also be much more severe. The more severe instances of SCP 100913-B are known to SCP 100913-A and other instances of SCP 100913-B as 'the beta testers', and have been observed to sit in front of a blank computer screen for up to 5 hours with the impression that they are interacting with SCP 100913-1. Other instances of SCP 100913-A may join in from time to time with the belief that they are watching a video stream of the beta tester's game. SCP 100913-A and all instances of SCP 100913-B that believe that they watched the beta tester interact with SCP 100913-1 seem to have a recollection of the same events occuring, prompting the hypothesis that these are mass hallucinations coordinated by SCP 100913-A. It is unclear how SCP 100913-A selects new instances of SCP 100913-B, nor how it selects beta testers. Little needs to be done to contain instances of SCP 100913-B, as they behave normally, and show no anomolous properties. <[newline]> ```
Dragon Lord#6944: ``` <[newline]> Description: <[newline]>   SCP 100913 is a designation given to objects relating to SCP 100913-A; a seemingly sentient humanoid that refers to itself as 'Jimmy from Mouse Hat Games'. SCP 100913-A is not hostile, and behaves similarly to a 2020's era 20 year old video game developer. The most notable visual feature of SCP 100913-A is a lack of facial definition similar to a blurry image. When asked about its appearance, SCP 100913-A simply stated, "It is not final, and will be improved before release". <[newline]> ```
Dragon Lord#6944: ``` <[newline]> SCP 100913: Primordial Jimmy <[newline]> Object class: Euclid <[newline]> Containment Procedure: <[newline]>   SCP 100913 is stored at site [REDACTED] in a small  windowless room designed to look like a standard canadian bedroom. The room is furnished in the style of the bedroom of a 2020's computerphile, and should be no smaller than 3mx2.5m with a ceiling no lower than 2m. The door does not need to be locked, as SCP 100913-A is content to program a ficticious game called 'Logic World' (see SCP 100913-1). Lights should be standard lighting bulbs not to exceed 100W and should be controled by a switch within the room. <[newline]>   a computer system of specifications listed in addendum A should be included in the room, as well as any supporting systems needed. Food should be brought into the room by casually dressed personel three times daily corresponding with breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the timezone of storage. A bathroom should be accessable, but may be shared with personel if needed, as SCP 100913-A is not agressive. Instances of SCP 100913-B should be monitored, but do not need to be contained. Any attempt by SCP 100913-A to release SCP 100913-1 will immediately upgrade SCP 100913's object class to apollyon. <[newline]> ```

Broyojo#2667: with decent quality
Broyojo#2667: yeah if only streaming had less delay
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Trying to express any complicated concept over text and with a large delay on feedback is extremely difficult, I've had similar experiences
PseudoGoose#2841: it just becomes a stream of consciousness that they have to follow to understand what i'm saying
PseudoGoose#2841: like with my edits ^
PseudoGoose#2841: mainly because miscommunication happens so often, or because the first time i write it isn't so clear, so i have to go back and clarify
PseudoGoose#2841: sometimes when there's an error or a problem, I solve it before they do and i try to help them through chat, which is just not a great idea, it feels awkward
PseudoGoose#2841: oh i have this issue with live coding streams
DanielGJ44#4557: I think schools and parents should do a better job of teaching people how to accept and adapt to criticism, but that would require an ideal world
Jimmy#8080: <@229403258278510593> I've also been in that situation. My recommendation is to ask if they want feedback on their code quality, and if they say no, just shut up
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: They published under ea
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I feel bad for the dev than
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: Nevermind it's ea
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: I feel so bad for the publisher of the game
Deleted User#0000: rip
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That touches on a fear of mine. Whenever someone shares code which I find issue with I have an urge to try and "help" them to the extent of my abilites. I try to repress that urge because I know I can come off harsh and I fear that I could say something which drives someone away from working on something they enjoy.
Dragon Lord#6944: had a really chill chemistry teacher in highschool <[newline]> one day she has a system of equations with two unknowns <[newline]> her: 'alright, who should we find first?' <[newline]> my dumb ass: 'waldo' <[newline]> her: 'get out. now' <[newline]> she must have been having a bad day, but i didn't want to crack a joke in her class for a long time after.
Dragon Lord#6944: felt similar, but not on something i worked hard on.
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: idk
Deleted User#0000: so then you doubt your own like
Deleted User#0000: but the way that you interpreted is why it felt so bad
Deleted User#0000: well maybe i overreacted i mean they could be having a bad day or they didn't mean it that way or some shit
Deleted User#0000: and then you think like
Dragon Lord#6944: D:
Deleted User#0000: and if it's code you don't even wanna touch it for another 6 months or some shit
Deleted User#0000: and it just drains all of your motivation towards whatever you were doing, away
Deleted User#0000: and even worse what you showed them was a small part of what you were working on
Deleted User#0000: you know when you think someone's your friend so you try to show them something or talk to them and then they react very aggressively very suddenly

Deleted User#0000: i think i'm just seeing the difference between sandbox and rpg here
Deleted User#0000: oh wait
Deleted User#0000: i wonder why some games don't do that
Jimmy#8080: Cities:Skylines also comes to mind
Jimmy#8080: That's how a lot of games go, i.e. Minecraft, KSP
Deleted User#0000: and then the people in the middle who like some modding sometimes or some vanilla or w/e
Deleted User#0000: and the people who just play the game in vanilla
Deleted User#0000: the people who write mods to do *everything* for them because that's pretty fun in its own right
Deleted User#0000: sometimes i wonder if LW will split into two camps
Deleted User#0000: trump.........
Jimmy#8080: I too am in favor of electoral reform in the US, but mr trump you had 4 years to do that and you didn't care until after you lost an election
Deleted User#0000: so are you with or against those damn canadian commies trump xd

Deleted User#0000: bitwise or is pretty fast
Deleted User#0000: i mean,
jrnvnjk#1582: And then, what i think the calculator did was a bitwise or
PseudoGoose#2841: sometimes it's just not zero
Deleted User#0000: somtimes it's 59 or 23 or 95
Deleted User#0000: sometimes it's 11111111
Deleted User#0000: sometimes true is just 1
Deleted User#0000: well it depends i guess
Deleted User#0000: then, true = (2^(word length)) - 1
jrnvnjk#1582: True is mostly everything except 0
Deleted User#0000: unless it's unsigned
Deleted User#0000: false = 0
Deleted User#0000: true = -1
Deleted User#0000: yes
jrnvnjk#1582: Yes cause -1 is all 1's in binairy

Saltypretzel#0321: more fun lesss effort
Saltypretzel#0321: it is easier to do
Saltypretzel#0321: yes so thats why EE is better
Nickproof#6817: Kinematics is boring? Depends on tasks that you are doing, it is core to engineering knowledge, and if you want to learn real applications(which are fun and painful) of physics you will need to understand and use power 3 derivatives/integrals (usually this is several equations for all 3 real world dimensions) and understand how kinematics work at least in general. Also kinematics is starting point for learning physics because it was first field discovered (Newton's laws are from it).
Nickproof#6817: And as bonus calculus helps to organize thinking, it will flush a lot of bad patterns from mind.
Saltypretzel#0321: EE is where it‚Äôs at
Saltypretzel#0321: Kinematics boring
Nickproof#6817: Also general understanding of calculus is great thing anyways, for statistics(calculating relative deviation, et cetera) for example or for programing (algorithm theory, graph theory and many more).
Nickproof#6817: Soviet teacher. He taught me a lot of useful things(despite being bad teacher compared to others that i had).
Stenodyon#8192: damn
Nickproof#6817: I did calculus at 9th grade.
Nickproof#6817: I think physics do need calculus almost for every case(at least at kinematics), at least to understand what is happening.
Stenodyon#8192: in france we learn calculus in 11th grade
Stenodyon#8192: depends on location
Ecconia#4929: No clue, but I will probably know by the end of this semester.
Broyojo#2667: I think college physics requires calculus?
Broyojo#2667: probably not though since no calculus involved
Broyojo#2667: but ap physics 1 so idk
Broyojo#2667: high school
Ecconia#4929: school or collage?

Verlio_H#0201: seems rather imposible for every single person to just randomly agge 69.420 yyears

Red_3D#3062: lets say you flip a theoretical perfect totally random magical math coin. <[newline]>  <[newline]> you know that it has a 50% chance of showing heads or tails. <[newline]>  <[newline]> after flipping it you know the result of that flip. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Even though you know the result it still had that 50% chance of being the opposite.
Verlio_H#0201: probably would be a subnormal number
Verlio_H#0201: I dont know about that but sure
Verlio_H#0201: well uhh
Red_3D#3062: it still had that chance though
Red_3D#3062: yes
Verlio_H#0201: *but it didn't*
Red_3D#3062: for example
Red_3D#3062: but it still could have happened
Red_3D#3062: yes
Verlio_H#0201: but if it did happen wwe would have already seen it happen
Red_3D#3062: but it still had a chance of happening
Red_3D#3062: yes
Verlio_H#0201: but but if you go into passed we already experienced it
Red_3D#3062: "knowing" what happend does not remove the probability of it happening
Verlio_H#0201: well then it would have happened wouldn't it
Red_3D#3062: well
Red_3D#3062: if someone figures out how to play with time it could happen
Verlio_H#0201: and it didn't happenm
Verlio_H#0201: but that instant aalready passed
Red_3D#3062: if repsis theory is correct someone someone could let us age
Red_3D#3062: well
Verlio_H#0201: the chance of everyone suddenly aging 69.420 years this instant is 0
Red_3D#3062: there are not that many things that have a 0% probability
Red_3D#3062: well
Deleted User#0000: i think the probability of us living in a self-imposed matrix is nonzero

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I always use caps on my macros/defines

Red_3D#3062: that being *make sure to check that it actually does what you want it to do*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Only for you to fix it with more defines
Red_3D#3062: well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yes, that being "stop using defines"
Red_3D#3062: wasting hours really teaches you something
Red_3D#3062: it gets better with time
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Assembly without defines is hell
Red_3D#3062: well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But to be fair
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Defines are fun in the short term

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...yes, that's probably gonna be me
Red_3D#3062: (that person being me)
Ecconia#4929: If you have noone in your project who #defines some crap, you can be pretty sure about it
Red_3D#3062: you can never be 100% certain
Red_3D#3062: but
Ecconia#4929: From now on, you all should be 100% sure about it - cause its super easy üôÇ
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (understandably so, coming from "normal" languages)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's pretty fun to hear people complain that it's backwards, because, to them, it's super weird
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Actually some assembly syntaxes use a reverse notation for that
Red_3D#3062: well, I was like 70% sure about it
Red_3D#3062: nah dude, idk how to english
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But that's a good way to remember stuff
Ecconia#4929: So we should change assignments!
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because you grab y, and put it in x

Red_3D#3062: Yes
Deleted User#0000: oh ok
Red_3D#3062: hat
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Idk
Deleted User#0000: what does ^ mean in that context
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Welcome to ~~hell~~ modern c++
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: arr[^pos]
Deleted User#0000: lmfao
Deleted User#0000: `no`
Red_3D#3062: No
Deleted User#0000: arr[++pos]
Deleted User#0000: -1-indexed arrays
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: arr[pos++] looks sleek tho
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: First you read a thing, then you increment the value
Red_3D#3062: But arr[pos++] is starting to sound better and better
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The longer version splits it into two operations
Red_3D#3062: Tbh, I agree
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (yes, two on the same line, asm programmers rise up)
Red_3D#3062: Well
Red_3D#3062: Hmm
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I prefer arr[pos]; pos++; for reading
Red_3D#3062: Yeah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I still find it odd to do stuff like arr[pos++]
Red_3D#3062: Hell yeah, x++ gang
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Exactly this reason
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I never use ++x cuz uh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: When both appear in the code my brain shuts down and it becomes unreadable
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But only when the programmer uses either ++x or x++
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I find ++ easy to read
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm in/lurk in several different communities and the difference in commitment to having an actual conversation on a topic varies wildly even between nerdy communities
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ~~developer debate with reasonable points and not devolving into memes about bad code~~
Red_3D#3062: Developer debate > presidential debate <[newline]> Change my mind
Red_3D#3062: Lol, well that is true
Red_3D#3062: You don't have to read it if you just rewrite it until it works
ForLoveOfCats#4111: just say what you are god damn it! <[newline]> (libc is horrible about this)
ForLoveOfCats#4111: that's also why I dislike shortened names which remove information
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I don't know about you but I spend vastly more time reading code than writing it, that's how it goes
Red_3D#3062: And that's all I need
Red_3D#3062: Tbh, it is just more comfortable to type
Red_3D#3062: But for stuff in loops I'd rather save that one byte of extra text
ForLoveOfCats#4111: the more you think about it the more you realize that `++` and `--` don't really seem to solve any problems
Red_3D#3062: Well yes
ForLoveOfCats#4111: and sometimes you want to do more than just 1
ForLoveOfCats#4111: which is useful as more than just + and - exist
ForLoveOfCats#4111: and it reuses an existing construct
Red_3D#3062: Yes
ForLoveOfCats#4111: that evaluates to the new value
ForLoveOfCats#4111: how about `variable += 1`
ForLoveOfCats#4111: exactly
Red_3D#3062: Nah
ForLoveOfCats#4111: But would you be 100% confident in that without looking it up?
Red_3D#3062: I'd say ++v evaluates to a new value
ForLoveOfCats#4111: which is part of the problem lol
Red_3D#3062: Lmao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I have no f-ing clue
ForLoveOfCats#4111: which one is which?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: One increments and evaluates to the new value, the other increments and evaluates to the old value
Red_3D#3062: Yes, and I hate it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: fun fact `++variable` and `variable++` mean different things
Red_3D#3062: Nah dude, you can't just not use ++ when working in C++
Deleted User#0000: ^

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Variable shadowing is very useful, take the following example <[newline]> ```rs <[newline]> fn do_thing(value: Option<u64>) { <[newline]>   if let Some(value) = value { <[newline]>     //Here I can use `value` as just the u64 <[newline]>     println!("{}",  <[newline]>   } <[newline]>  <[newline]>   //`value` here is still the `Option<u64>` <[newline]> }```
Red_3D#3062: Well, ok
ForLoveOfCats#4111: then you name it something else lol
Red_3D#3062: If I need it
Red_3D#3062: How would I access the other i
Red_3D#3062: But
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Naw, variable shadowing is extremely useful
Red_3D#3062: But I sure don't like it
Red_3D#3062: Well, I guess that makes sense
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So variable shadowing is legal in C, I completely forgot about that
Red_3D#3062: Oh boy
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ``` <[newline]> 0 <[newline]> 1 <[newline]> 0 <[newline]> 1```
ForLoveOfCats#4111: this is valid C which prints
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ```c <[newline]>   for(int i = 0; i < 2; i += 1) { <[newline]>     for(int i = 0; i < 2; i += 1) { <[newline]>       printf("%i\n", i); <[newline]>     } <[newline]>   } <[newline]> ```
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Oh what
ForLoveOfCats#4111: No that was the point of what I was saying is that it would not be ~~possible~~ reasonable to ommit providing an index name
Red_3D#3062: Oh
Red_3D#3062: How can I access the index
ForLoveOfCats#4111: wait
Red_3D#3062: Hmm
Deleted User#0000: lmao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Valid C and prints "Hello world" four time
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ```c <[newline]> #include <stdio.h> <[newline]>  <[newline]> #define FOR_RANGE(LOWER, HIGHER) \ <[newline]> for(int __for_range_prefix ## __LINE__ = LOWER; __for_range_prefix ## __LINE__ < HIGHER; __for_range_prefix ## __LINE__ += 1) <[newline]>  <[newline]> int main(void) { <[newline]>   FOR_RANGE(0, 2) { <[newline]>     FOR_RANGE(0, 2) { <[newline]>       printf("Hello world\n"); <[newline]>     } <[newline]>   } <[newline]>  <[newline]>   return 0; <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
ForLoveOfCats#4111: This is what I came up with
Deleted User#0000: not bad var names but what the fuck are those comments
Deleted User#0000: so it shouldnt have anything to do with lines of code
Deleted User#0000: its in `touch`
Deleted User#0000: (now in proper simushell) <[newline]> this one doesnt even have a convienent comment, I have no idea what this means
Deleted User#0000: granted, it does include comments in simushell, but still
Red_3D#3062: not that nice though
Red_3D#3062: I guess this works
Red_3D#3062: ```cpp <[newline]> #include<iostream> <[newline]> #define range(i,low,high) unsigned int i = low; i < high; i++ <[newline]>  <[newline]> int main() { <[newline]>  <[newline]>     for (range(i, 0, 10)) { <[newline]>         std::cout << "Hi\n"; <[newline]>     } <[newline]>     return 0; <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
Deleted User#0000: that is *a lot* more than I expected
Deleted User#0000: 430
Deleted User#0000: holy fuck
Deleted User#0000: as compared to simushells current 430
Deleted User#0000: HSRE is still only 91 loc
Deleted User#0000: that is
Deleted User#0000: in hackshell-reloaded
ForLoveOfCats#4111: `indiemath`
Deleted User#0000: there are no other bad ones
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm going to hack that together now
Deleted User#0000: why the fuck are my vars named well
Red_3D#3062: stop
ForLoveOfCats#4111: that can be added to a predefined prefix to achieve the expected results
ForLoveOfCats#4111: there is a way for a macro to get the line number
ForLoveOfCats#4111: boo
Red_3D#3062: you can just pass that in as a parameter
Deleted User#0000: it appears it stands for `is command executed`
ForLoveOfCats#4111: you could combine a set prefix with the line number
ForLoveOfCats#4111: well actually
Red_3D#3062: one sec
Red_3D#3062: > Red I would think that would run into name conflicts if one attempted to use it nested within another as iirc C/C++ preprocessor macros have no way to generate unique names? <[newline]> uh, well.
Deleted User#0000: after looking at my code
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Red_3D#3062: all the ice has melted my dude
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Red I would think that would run into name conflicts if one attempted to use it nested within another as iirc C/C++ preprocessor macros have no way to generate unique names?
Deleted User#0000: what does this mean
Deleted User#0000: the *second* version of hackshell, `HackShell-Reloaded`, still not simushell yet tho
Red_3D#3062: you can just make a quick macro to get similar functionality
Red_3D#3062: ngl
ForLoveOfCats#4111: There goes the Blub programmer looking down the power scale again lol
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ```rs <[newline]> for _ in 0..5 { <[newline]> }```
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Sidebar but oh god I've been spoiled by range based for loops
Deleted User#0000: i even name variables well here
Deleted User#0000: shockingly
Deleted User#0000: this is literally all of the code
Deleted User#0000: idk what it is about the original hackshell but it feels so foriegn and small to me
Deleted User#0000: time to go to the original simushell, hackshell
Deleted User#0000: i appear to actually have reasonable variable names in my bot
Deleted User#0000: ok
Red_3D#3062: oh god
Red_3D#3062: no
Deleted User#0000: iterates through pokemon
Deleted User#0000: pokedex
ForLoveOfCats#4111: `chardex` to be character index ect
ForLoveOfCats#4111: the closest to shortening I do commonly is adding `dex` to the end of something to signify index but I've been moving away from that
Deleted User#0000: but i dont want to write 3 more characters *and* i want to include a reference to current popular media
ForLoveOfCats#4111: use longer lines and split over multiple lines <[newline]> I don't care, just say what you are
ForLoveOfCats#4111: we have code formatters
ForLoveOfCats#4111: we are no longer on tele-type machines
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I vehemently dislike unnessesary shortening of names
ForLoveOfCats#4111: that also reminds me of acronyms and shortening names in code

ForLoveOfCats#4111: `imp` ü§î
Deleted User#0000: but its a secret
Deleted User#0000: i know
Deleted User#0000: well
Deleted User#0000: what the fuck does imp mean
Deleted User#0000: no
Red_3D#3062: > caught it before deletion <[newline]> aka bd
RyanT#1426: generally, I use `i` and `j` for indexers and for other variables I name them descriptively. ex: the variable for the size of the grid in my simple DLS is called `gridSize`
Deleted User#0000: > more like meth line lmao <[newline]> is what he said <[newline]> caught it before deletion
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Red_3D#3062: math string
Deleted User#0000: independent math?
Red_3D#3062: in die math
ForLoveOfCats#4111: `character_index`, `line_index`, ect. Gotta describe what it is the index *of*
ForLoveOfCats#4111: or even better
Deleted User#0000: what the fuck does `indiemath` even mean
ForLoveOfCats#4111: `index` ftw
Deleted User#0000: i am finding some epicly bad names in my code
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I only really ever use single character names for type parameters
Deleted User#0000: hold on
Jimmy#8080: Whenever I see a single character variable name (`x`, `t`, ect) that isn't a for loop indexer, I lose my fucking mind
Red_3D#3062: using numbers in var names is a much bigger sin
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's hard to hold a concept in your head when the code describes it in a way which is contrary to the actual behavior
Red_3D#3062: oh god
Deleted User#0000: i use `i2`
Red_3D#3062: what if you have loops in loops
Deleted User#0000: using it for anything else is a sin
Deleted User#0000: ~~like a good person~~
Deleted User#0000: in for loops
Deleted User#0000: i only use `i` for iteration
Red_3D#3062: haha, i,j,k,x,y go brrrr
ForLoveOfCats#4111: In all seriousness I do think that naming things well is *one of* the most important things to producing quality code
Deleted User#0000: but it actually does something entirely different
Deleted User#0000: it does the illusion of logic
Deleted User#0000: illusionary logic unit
Deleted User#0000: alu <[newline]> more like ilu
Deleted User#0000: ~~owo~~
Jimmy#8080: I'm jk ilu bro ‚ù§Ô∏è
Deleted User#0000: you fucking beat me to it
Jimmy#8080: then I call it "drake"
Deleted User#0000: if X variable is annoying
Jimmy#8080: I keep it all in a little notebook
Deleted User#0000: for example
Deleted User#0000: he bases the variables function after their personally in real life
RyanT#1426: > I have a variable named "David", a variable named "Jennifer", ect <[newline]> How do you remember what each variable does <@!154964593397989376>?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: (very unoriginal joke lol)
Red_3D#3062: lmao
ForLoveOfCats#4111: There are two hard things in programming: naming things, cache invalidation, and off by one errors
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Red_3D#3062: this makes me uncomfortable
Red_3D#3062: idk
Red_3D#3062: (David << 8) + Jennifer
Deleted User#0000: not name your variables somewhat descriptively
Deleted User#0000: do you guys like
Deleted User#0000: holy fuck
Jimmy#8080: I have a variable named "David", a variable named "Jennifer", ect
Jimmy#8080: I like to give my variables personality by naming them after people I know

Verlio_H#0201: yes
Saltypretzel#0321: Then you die
Saltypretzel#0321: No farmers, no food
Saltypretzel#0321: Because farmers are very important
Verlio_H#0201: probably too late
FacePox#2708: I‚Äôll find a list of the important ones
FacePox#2708: Don‚Äôt read them all, most of them are about weird things like the navy and the economy
Jimmy#8080: Thank you, I have added it to my reading list
FacePox#2708: I highly recommend reading the important federalist papers, they‚Äôre works of political genius imo
FacePox#2708: See ancient Athens for a great example of that
FacePox#2708: Pure, direct democracy leads to mob rule
Verlio_H#0201: yeah but if you thiink about it sometimes the rural should win, reason 1, if rural never win then rural people move out or move into cities which is bad, reason 2, if only 1 party rules then bad things happen, reason 3, if rural makes up lets say 40% of people (idk the number) I would say that it is fair to have the rural win 40% of the time
FacePox#2708: Where minority rights are ignored
FacePox#2708: That can lead to a tyranny of the majority
FacePox#2708: Well
Jimmy#8080: Government is about doing what's best for the highest number of people, yes?
Jimmy#8080: But also here's a thought: why should few people living rurally have the same influence as many people living urbanly?
jrnvnjk#1582: I thought so already
Verlio_H#0201: they have ddifferent live styles so see things differently
Verlio_H#0201: yes thats how it works
jrnvnjk#1582: I looked at the map, people in most larger cities are more likely to vote for democrats, the rest is more likely to vote for republicans
Verlio_H#0201: the issue to me is lets say a state with a large city and lots of rural area is close to 50 50 like georgia for example, even though only 50% of the people voted for 1 party all the votes go to that party
FacePox#2708: I think the system they have in place should be expanded
Verlio_H#0201: well I mean if we did it like nebraska or maine iit would be all fine and dandy
FacePox#2708: James Madison makes a very compelling argument for this type of thing in federalist paper 10
Verlio_H#0201: true
FacePox#2708: I actually support the electoral college because it stops the urban states from trampling the rural states
Verlio_H#0201: like come on now why do we have to vote for someone to vote
Verlio_H#0201: yeah
Jimmy#8080: (god the electoral college is so stupid)
Jimmy#8080: Which totals 36 electoral votes -- way more than enough to win the presidency for Biden, if they hold. Counting is not finished in either state
Jimmy#8080: Yes <@!350975527324221451> , in the past 24 hours both Georgia and Pennsylvania have flipped from Trump to Biden
RyanT#1426: wait... so another state went with biden?

Jimmy#8080: I always use January 1st 1990
Dragon Lord#6944: it's close enough to my actuall bday to give a really good approximation, but far enough that it's hard to use it as an identifier
Dragon Lord#6944: january 21 1999
Dragon Lord#6944: i use a fake b-day online, but it's always the same fake birthday
Verlio_H#0201: if it wasn't tomorrow would be ur birthday
RyanT#1426: ok, so you were born in late 98'
Dragon Lord#6944: about 2.25 months off
Dragon Lord#6944: it's approximate
Verlio_H#0201: nice

Dragon Lord#6944: they still are if you want to go on a nostalgia trip

Buzz#6223: i had pizza hut for the first time like     3 days ago or smth
Verlio_H#0201: but NO ONE OUT PIZZAS THE HUT
Stefan#5422: even if there were any nearby to me, there is no way it could beat that one Pizzeria
Verlio_H#0201: f
Stefan#5422: Yeah because it goes without saying that I have never eaten any pizza hut
Buzz#6223: nobody has anything against the hut <:o_o:755226331817574412> <:gun:746348566234005505>

Dragon Lord#6944: but xnor...
Saltypretzel#0321: well xnor is technically a xand gate
Dragon Lord#6944: *but why?*
Dragon Lord#6944: ``` <[newline]> x|y|o <[newline]> ----- <[newline]> 0|0|1 <[newline]> 0|1|0 <[newline]> 1|0|0 <[newline]> 1|1|1 <[newline]> ```
Saltypretzel#0321: aeugh xand sounds nasty
Dragon Lord#6944: why would you have 2 names for the same gate?
Dragon Lord#6944: > trick xand treat <[newline]> <@!371851806067654657> so apparently that's an actuall gate... but it's literally xnor...

Saltypretzel#0321: hhhhh whats trick transformer treat
Saltypretzel#0321: ok fine
Buzz#6223: outside is when it's low
Buzz#6223: inside the circle is when the input is high
Buzz#6223: <:o_o:755226331817574412>
Buzz#6223: that's what the outside being white is for
Saltypretzel#0321: no it blocks one direction
Buzz#6223: not at all
Buzz#6223: that's not trick diode treat
Buzz#6223: no
Saltypretzel#0321: trick diode treat version
Saltypretzel#0321: hmmm trick diode treat has too version
Buzz#6223: because voltage drop
Buzz#6223: yeah maybe that's trick diode treat
Saltypretzel#0321: trick diode treat?
Saltypretzel#0321: mmm

Saltypretzel#0321: oh i need to make trick inductor treat
Saltypretzel#0321: sure
Buzz#6223: you could apply that to any of them-
Saltypretzel#0321: trick is treat when it really isnt and short circuits

Buzz#6223: trick is treat
Buzz#6223: nO
Buzz#6223: maybe doable
Saltypretzel#0321: Trick resistor treat so you don‚Äôt get the short circuit

Buzz#6223: that's also not a logic gate hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Saltypretzel#0321: ~~How about trick ALU treat~~
Saltypretzel#0321: Idk
Saltypretzel#0321: I mean
Saltypretzel#0321: mmm
Buzz#6223: cringe
Buzz#6223: that's
Buzz#6223: it's b implies a
Buzz#6223: you flip the inputs and boom

Saltypretzel#0321: ~~I bet the gate will haunt your dreams~~
Buzz#6223: NOOOOOOO
Saltypretzel#0321:

Saltypretzel#0321: The **imply** gate
Saltypretzel#0321: Fine we will use the gate you hate
Buzz#6223: that's illegal
Saltypretzel#0321: who says that. We force it to be a logic operation
Buzz#6223: >>>>>>:((((
Buzz#6223: it wouldn't be anything because thats nOt a logic operation
Buzz#6223: <:o_o:755226331817574412>
Saltypretzel#0321: Idk what that would be
Saltypretzel#0321: Trick diode treat
Saltypretzel#0321: Trick monostable treat (trick is treat only for a bit)
Dragon Lord#6944: trick and treat unless you look, then trick xor treat.
Dragon Lord#6944: schrodinger's halloween
Buzz#6223: that's not a logic gate >:(
Buzz#6223: lol
Saltypretzel#0321: How about trick Schmitt trigger treat (trick will be treat soon)
Saltypretzel#0321: sure
Buzz#6223: trick buffer treat xd
Buzz#6223: not
Buzz#6223: i think that'd just be "trick is treat"
Saltypretzel#0321: Trick buffer treat says that trick = treat. If it isn‚Äôt, then your logic has a short circuit and will self destruct
Dragon Lord#6944: don't want to give people seizures
Saltypretzel#0321: How about trick buffer treat

RyanT#1426: also, apparently there's a metric foot
RyanT#1426: what's a "real unit"?
Red_3D#3062: darn
Red_3D#3062: thats 15.24 real units
Verlio_H#0201: yes but in america we get to stand like 6'' closer than europeans
BekfastStealer#9784: As an American, I can confirm this. I think of the 6 feet social distancing as "around a person height."
Red_3D#3062: Americans trying to use anything but the metric system:
Broyojo#2667: how about express all of your distances in planck lengths
Red_3D#3062: "dude, I just went 0,000...1 on a highway"

Nik#1011: I guess you'd go through a 2 phase randomness generator..... phase 1 is select the type of output, and phase 2 is the exact output
Nik#1011: but more complicated than that.... something like <[newline]>  <[newline]> 2+2 = `823478052` <[newline]> 3+3 = `0.16` <[newline]> 3+2 = üçß  <[newline]> 2+3 = `football`

Jimmy#8080: ah nice
FacePox#2708: so the image states the theorem in it's entirety
FacePox#2708: which by the way excludes 0
FacePox#2708: natural numbers
FacePox#2708: N
Jimmy#8080: I think they all must also be positive numbers, because `(-1)^3 + 1^3 = 0^3`
Dragon Lord#6944: quote of the century: <[newline]> '1^3 + 1^3 = 1^3' -<@!154964593397989376>
Jimmy#8080: oh shoot yeah I do
FacePox#2708: you mean if they're all zero
FacePox#2708: 2 does not equal 1
Jimmy#8080: IIRC part of the theorem is that A B and C must all be different, but the image doesn't specify that
Jimmy#8080: If üçé , üçë and üü† are all 1, then üçç can be any number >2
Verlio_H#0201: they could have just reduced it to 2 lines by having pineapple - 2
Verlio_H#0201: but it covers the pineapl
Verlio_H#0201: oh I guess te other ones
Verlio_H#0201: ye wwell the third covers the > 0 part so
Dragon Lord#6944: the second line says that they must be integers and > 0
Saltypretzel#0321: yeah
Verlio_H#0201: ah yes so I was right basically
Saltypretzel#0321: N means natural number
Saltypretzel#0321: ‚àà means set of
Verlio_H#0201: I think its like a^n+b^n‚â†c^n where n is greater than 2, and idk what the second line means but I assume its sying it has to be an integer or something
RyanT#1426: I dont even know what the middle one means or what Fermat's last theorem is so... good on you
Dragon Lord#6944: I knew that theorem, and i knew 99.9repeating == 100, but i didn't notice the bar and didn't recognize the theorem recontextuallized as a viral fruit math puzzle

Stefan#5422: Also we were told to get up and be ready for class at 07:40 at our pc but the teach is not showing up
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Old code is incompatible with my new system, and making them compatible is a waste of time since i'm gonna replace the old code anyways
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I'm re-writing stuff so that happens
Stefan#5422: great
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And I won't be fixing it for at least 5 days
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I just did that yesterday
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Which is great
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Without consequences
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Break the codebase
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I can just
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But because I am the only person to ever commit in there
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: So i went to dms
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because they asked some stuff in a server (server owner doesn't really like talk about "illegitimate" songs cuz taito's legal team is *really* active)
Stefan#5422: That avoids this kind of thing
Stefan#5422: The thing is if I use a tool and talk to other people I just assume they know more than me
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But they were asking me
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: They didn't remember
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And they went "oh"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And then I pointed them towards the person making 100% of the commits in that repo
Stefan#5422: And they did?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because I couldn't remember something I coded a few months back
CrispyPin#1149: imagine having eyes
Stefan#5422: do they have eyes
Stefan#5422: Yeah still
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Just an individual that told me
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That wasn't for a job or whatever
Stefan#5422: Wait the fuck
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: There hasn't been a single commit from someone else on that repo
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I am the person who made that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That I didn't know anything about GCST file manager
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Someone once told me
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Actually
Stefan#5422: Yeah so we dont think you know enough about the tool you created
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And then it's like 5 years old
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But they're like "oh we want this tool looks old must be 20 years old at least"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That's fine
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Alright
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: 6 years of experience in coding in general

Buzz#6223: 0 , o
Saltypretzel#0321: Year... I got it in 6th grade summer
Buzz#6223: oop
Verlio_H#0201: my school computers have 16gb storage lmao
Saltypretzel#0321: But I did root the phone (it was a pain in the ass to root) and install an SD card
Buzz#6223: `2005`
Buzz#6223: what year's this bitch from lmao
Buzz#6223: <:chefskiss:600065479910096925>
Saltypretzel#0321: So more like 6 times as much ram usable lol
Buzz#6223: lovely
Buzz#6223: ah
Saltypretzel#0321: So 2 gigs usable
Saltypretzel#0321: 2 gigs used by android itself
Saltypretzel#0321: It‚Äôs 4 gigs available
Buzz#6223: my computer has 3 times that much *ram*
Saltypretzel#0321: And not even 4 gigs free
Saltypretzel#0321: I was basically managing storage to the megabyte
Dragon Lord#6944: not flags...
Dragon Lord#6944: i used üá≥ üá¶    üá≤ üá¶ üáπ üá™
Buzz#6223: jEsus
Saltypretzel#0321: yep
Buzz#6223: O _ O
Buzz#6223: `storage?`
Buzz#6223: wait
Saltypretzel#0321: It had 4 gigabytes of storage
Saltypretzel#0321: And believe me I‚Äôm not exaggerating
Buzz#6223: ah
Saltypretzel#0321: well I do have an old android phone that was very slow and bad
Dragon Lord#6944: not sure what happened with that...
Buzz#6223: oh i see
Verlio_H#0201: I think actually discord just loads its own images for most emojis
Buzz#6223: namate
Dragon Lord#6944: üá≥üá¶  üá≤üá¶üáπüá™
Buzz#6223: `>:(`
Buzz#6223: and it's
Buzz#6223: but apple phones dont use discord emojis they use apple emojis
Buzz#6223: `emoji font`
Saltypretzel#0321: prob need to ubdate
Verlio_H#0201: and I think it same font
Buzz#6223: hm
Verlio_H#0201: on macos I can see wand so
Saltypretzel#0321: m y phone
Buzz#6223: apple be like
Buzz#6223: what brand phone smg
Saltypretzel#0321: p h o n e
Buzz#6223: 
Buzz#6223: whh
Saltypretzel#0321: 
Buzz#6223: what device are you using smhhhhhhh
Saltypretzel#0321: that‚Äôs a question box
Buzz#6223: poof
Buzz#6223: ü™Ñ
Saltypretzel#0321: Give me some magician power
Buzz#6223: magic
Saltypretzel#0321: how you even make compute form marble
Saltypretzel#0321: you are too smort
Dragon Lord#6944: ||provided that it's turing complete||
Buzz#6223: <a:PensiveExtreme:664621705108652044>
Buzz#6223: and enough memory
Dragon Lord#6944: given enough time, anything can
Dragon Lord#6944: again, not sure if it'll ever be built bc of cost, but fun to design
Buzz#6223: but can it run crysis <:GWbruhGalaxyThink:405065193287319552>
Dragon Lord#6944: but more paralellized and programable
Buzz#6223: damn
Dragon Lord#6944: i'm planning on something similar to turing tumble
Dragon Lord#6944: yeah, but the alu will be easy if i can get the inputs right
Dragon Lord#6944: figured that i could save design time by using the same design for standard registers as the pc
Buzz#6223: sounds pretty difficult O-0
Dragon Lord#6944: in the planning phase, not sure if it'll ever get built
Buzz#6223: :0
Buzz#6223: oooh?
Buzz#6223: pushing it onto the stack
Dragon Lord#6944: it's what i plan on doing with the marble computer
Buzz#6223: and then youre just
Buzz#6223: but then you just gotta multiplex it again to read it
Buzz#6223: yeah
Dragon Lord#6944: you could use reading/writing to the pc as a stand in for a `call` and `ret` on simpler cpu's
Buzz#6223: well, reading the PC is important for things like subroutines ü§î
Buzz#6223: smg
Buzz#6223: program counter
Saltypretzel#0321: What about the computer
Buzz#6223: <@!282378798023049216> it's not really possible when your PC is a different size, and there's never really any reason to read the PC
Saltypretzel#0321: Just an existence check in so people know I exist
Saltypretzel#0321: M
Dragon Lord#6944: idk, seems easier to have every register looking the same to the computer
Nik#1011: ok probably mine
Nik#1011: pshhhh what lame ass computer can't read the program counter
Buzz#6223: The program counter doesn't work the same as other registers. typically you cant read from it, for example
Nik#1011: also, can confirm. getting haircut helps with feeling gross.
Nik#1011: so if the program counter is 8 bit then the computer is at least 8 bit as well <:Kappa:374412912078356481>
Nik#1011: <@!427964757492891649> isn't a program counter technically just a register with extra features? I mean you can read/write to it
Buzz#6223: ;-;
Buzz#6223: me too
Red_3D#3062: I should try that
Red_3D#3062: *looks at hair*
Red_3D#3062: wait really?
FacePox#2708: Hey so it turns out that if you get a haircut you stop feeling so disgusting
RyanT#1426: oh
Buzz#6223: <@!119734190571913216> not 8 bit registers, that'd make it an 8 bit computer
Buzz#6223: <@!350975527324221451> real life, with discrete RTL logic :P
Nik#1011: sure you're limiting yourself in interesting ways but where do you draw the line I guess. what still counts as a 4 bit computer
Nik#1011: could you have a 4 bit computer with 8 bit op codes and 8 bit PC and 8 bit registers and all that stuff
Nik#1011: so like
RyanT#1426: üëÖ? <:LogicWorld:568323807731908608>?
RyanT#1426: whatca making it in?
Buzz#6223: don't ask why <:gun:746348566234005505>
Buzz#6223: my CPU that im makin is going to have like... 8 "NOP when Carry and Zero are high" instructions <:bigbrain:729154250613194863>
Verlio_H#0201: also instruction length can be longer
Verlio_H#0201: ye multi word op
Buzz#6223: also on the Z80, for example, there were several (a fuck ton of) 2-byte opcodes
Buzz#6223: you can also have more than 2 bit opcodes with a similar method
Buzz#6223: ask jimbo
Buzz#6223: idk man
Buzz#6223: so i just typed :blaze and then tab
Nik#1011: is that female shrek
Buzz#6223: i forgot i dont have nitro anymore
Buzz#6223: i did not mean to use that emoji
Buzz#6223: oops
Buzz#6223: addressing more than 4 2-bit words of memory <:shrek_ablaze:741795098391740436>
Nik#1011: but what about reading. what is the program counter bigger number useful for
Nik#1011: ok writing to the counter with multiple uses of the bus I understand
Nik#1011: hmmm
Buzz#6223: almost like multiplexing
Buzz#6223: as it was done with all them CPUs
Verlio_H#0201: ^
Buzz#6223: you can use more than one register and load it into the PC, or use multiple immediate values
Verlio_H#0201: easy
Nik#1011: used
Nik#1011: but if the whole cpu only supports 2 bit everything, how is an 8 bit program counter
Nik#1011: lol
Verlio_H#0201: lol
Buzz#6223: 4004 more like 12012  <[newline]> -nik probably
Buzz#6223: guess the fuckin 4004 is a 12 bit CPU
Buzz#6223: guess the 8080 is a 16 bit CPU
Buzz#6223: even though that's how it's been done since at least the early 70s, dont know about specific CPUs before that
Buzz#6223: somehow
Buzz#6223: nik disagrees .-.
Buzz#6223: yes
Verlio_H#0201: exactly
Buzz#6223: say all your RAM is 2 bits and all of your registers are 2 bits, all your math operations are 2 bits, everything's 2 bits, but your program counter alone is, say, 8 bits. That doesn't make your computer an 8 bit computer because "8 bit computer" means that the word size that the computer works with is 8 bits. that's not the case. It makes it a 2 bit computer with an 8 bit address bus.
Verlio_H#0201: f
Nik#1011: life is a lie
Nik#1011: great
Nik#1011: ok I have now realized the bit depth of a computer architecture is subjective
Buzz#6223: the address bus width doesn't have to be the same as the bit width of the computer itself and that's just how it is .-.
Verlio_H#0201: what about we do this other way then, 128 bits woorth of memory addresses
Buzz#6223: o h m y g o d
Buzz#6223: no because the computer can still work with 64 bits
Verlio_H#0201: ok well then if you have a 64 bit computer but only 32 bits worth of memory and stuff that means its a 32 bit computer?
Nik#1011: wat
Buzz#6223: no
Buzz#6223: or whatever
Buzz#6223: your computer has a 64 gigabit CPU?
Nik#1011: nah bad definition
Buzz#6223: no
Buzz#6223: ok so a turing machine is an infinite bit CPU? .-.
Buzz#6223: no, because the fact that the numbers youre working with are 64 bit makes it a 64 bit CPU
Nik#1011: 1 bit cpu
Buzz#6223: wha
Nik#1011: ok then I'll put a 64 bit cpu connect to 64 bit ram connected by a 1 bit bus that uses time-based data transfer
Buzz#6223: o_o
Buzz#6223: it wouldn't have a 4 bit bus
Nik#1011: if you say hey I made a 2 bit computer, but it has a 4 bit bus and 4 bit counter and 4 bit memory address and 4 bit cpu instruction coding then it's not a 2 bit computer anymore
Buzz#6223: xd
Buzz#6223: amount of memory =/= word size
Nik#1011: lmao
Buzz#6223: no it isn't wtf
Buzz#6223: the PDP-8 has 1 register lol
Nik#1011: cheating, then <@427964757492891649>
Verlio_H#0201: in mc there is a lot of redstone computers with 4 registers that are turing complete
Buzz#6223: even on CPUs like the Z80 and 6502 the program counter is double the size of the actual data
Nik#1011: wouldn't you only be able to address 4 words of ram
Buzz#6223: which is 4 in this case :P
Nik#1011: but how do you use reasonable amounts of ram
Buzz#6223: i dont know if anyone has made one, but literally the only difference between that and a 64 bit computer is the biggest number it can represent
Buzz#6223: the only difference is the biggest number that can be held in one "cell" of memory
Nik#1011: show me a 2 bit computer with finite resources :o
Buzz#6223: 2 and 3 bit are definitely turing complete tho lmao
Nik#1011: disgusting
Verlio_H#0201: its a 1 bit computer with infinite ram and pmem built on branching
Nik#1011: ugh
Buzz#6223: yes
Nik#1011: *no*
Buzz#6223: so then yes a 1 bit computer is turing complete lol
Buzz#6223: yeah
Nik#1011: so in that sense sure it's 1 bit
Nik#1011: the classic turring machine example only reads/writes single bits to the tape
Nik#1011: I mean
Buzz#6223: the tape is infinite, the number of symbols is finite (i think)
Nik#1011: and infinite tape I guess too xd
Nik#1011: not really, it has infinite states you can program into the tape reader
Buzz#6223: ü§î
Buzz#6223: in fact, im pretty sure a turing machine is a 1 bit computer
Buzz#6223: smh
Buzz#6223: a one bit computer can
Red_3D#3062: hm
Nik#1011: i mean can a 2 bit computer even be turring complete? I know a 4 bit computer can, not sure about 3, 2 seems absolutely impossible
Stefan#5422: You can grow infinity
Stefan#5422: If you produce enough product to double your production
Buzz#6223: e
Stefan#5422: That would be fun
Red_3D#3062: oh god
Red_3D#3062: O-O
Stefan#5422: every night the bits of your pc doubles
Buzz#6223: 2 bit computer when
Red_3D#3062: sounds nice
Buzz#6223: ***aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa***
Stefan#5422: build a 1 bit system then
Buzz#6223: it'd be really easy, i just dont want to build a 4 bit system xd
Stefan#5422: <@!427964757492891649> its just a normal cpu with 4 bits but you do some software magic on it
Stefan#5422: 
Buzz#6223: ; - ;
Stefan#5422: <@!427964757492891649> I challange you to build a 4 bit system and add two 128 bit numbers
DanielGJ44#4557: Seems legit
DanielGJ44#4557: 
Stefan#5422: This would work the reverse way of doing 128 bit addition on a 2 bit system
Buzz#6223: lmao
Buzz#6223: if you're using a processor with that kind of bit width do you even need carry flags ;-;
Stefan#5422: I mean you probably would reserve some of the bits for overflow bits so
Buzz#6223: 0-o
Stefan#5422: ok you could design a 512 bit pc and split it into multiple 64 bit parallel units
Verlio_H#0201: me who has a bit for every x aand every y on my plotters in mc
Buzz#6223: that's pretty wild
Buzz#6223: apparently GPUs have 256 bit data busses? ü§î
Stefan#5422: I knew it could do that but not that fast
Stefan#5422: holy ü¶Ü
Stefan#5422: How a quantum computer could break 2048-bit RSA encryption in 8 hours
Buzz#6223: 256 maybe
Buzz#6223: im pretty sure 128 bit has been done
Buzz#6223: i think it *has* been done
Stefan#5422: The math it could do would be astonashing
Red_3D#3062: poor registers
Red_3D#3062: oh god
Stefan#5422: Do you think that would be feasable to do
Buzz#6223: 2048 bit computer when
Buzz#6223: oh jesus
Stefan#5422: Does 256 bit machine
Buzz#6223: it's pretty easy when youre just doing 8/12 bit stuff ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Stefan#5422: It takes to much effort for my taste
Buzz#6223: hell ye
Stefan#5422: Hardware stuff is awsome
Buzz#6223: now i mostly just do hardware stuff üòî
Buzz#6223: never touched it again
Buzz#6223: and then
Verlio_H#0201: f
Buzz#6223: i made a cookie-clicker type game with java and jframe once
Stefan#5422: I tried Java like IÕèÕú ÃµÕÅdÃ∂ÕÄÕÅoÃõÕèÕ†nÕÅ“âÕèÕ†ÃßtÃ¥Ã∑Õû ÕüÕúrÕ¢Ã®ÕûeÕüÃ∂Ã∏mÃ∂“âÕúÕ°Ã°bÕèÕ†Ã°eÃ¥ÕÅÃ®“âÃ∂Ã∑“ârÕùÕúÕ° years ago and I gave up quickly because I was young and not able to do simple stuff
Buzz#6223: other than like HTML lol
Verlio_H#0201: you cant do switch(string) it says that you are bad and idiot an stupid and bad
Buzz#6223: i think C++ was the first real language i tried to learn
Stefan#5422: and use the number of that
Red_3D#3062: lol
Stefan#5422: just make it a hash
Red_3D#3062: I could swear that I did that not so long ago
Stefan#5422: wait what
Verlio_H#0201: yes
Red_3D#3062: really?
Verlio_H#0201: in c++
Red_3D#3062: in python?
Red_3D#3062: huh
Verlio_H#0201: ~~but not being able to use strings in switch statements = pain~~
Red_3D#3062: what
Stefan#5422: what
Verlio_H#0201: am I the only who leaarned c++ first and found it easy because of all the computational redstone that do
DanielGJ44#4557: Is how it was explained to me anyways
DanielGJ44#4557: Knowing the language I think is secondary, it's more about teaching problem solving
Buzz#6223: damn
DanielGJ44#4557: Most universities teach Python for engineering here to my knowledge
Stefan#5422: yes
Buzz#6223: or middleschool
Red_3D#3062: like... as a bride between c++ dlls for example
Buzz#6223: a highschool
Buzz#6223: maybe like
Stefan#5422: I know a school that teaches python
Buzz#6223: i guess
Red_3D#3062: well, python can be super awesome if used right
Buzz#6223: lol
Buzz#6223: teaching python in a professional environment doesn't make much sense to me but ü§î
Red_3D#3062: ok, that sounds reasonable
Buzz#6223: i guess that might maybe make sense then
Buzz#6223: ah
DanielGJ44#4557: Although maybe advanced is the wrong word, more specialised is how I'd describe the program
Red_3D#3062: ah
Stefan#5422: Plague doctor
Red_3D#3062: > [|87 <[newline]> you learning regex?
Buzz#6223: python is truly a very complex difficult language
Stefan#5422: [|87
Red_3D#3062: why
Red_3D#3062: wait, what
DanielGJ44#4557: LOL so I'm technically in the less advanced engineering program and we learn C++ while the more advanced one learns Python
Stefan#5422: [|87
Stefan#5422: 2-0
Red_3D#3062: O-O
Stefan#5422: ... unless
Stefan#5422: haha just kidding
Red_3D#3062: :(
Stefan#5422: but without learning
Stefan#5422: I am the right one right now
Red_3D#3062: was both at some point
Red_3D#3062: can confirm
Red_3D#3062: yes

Red_3D#3062: I thought: <[newline]> 110: bad person <[newline]> 112: ouch
Red_3D#3062: I can call the police through 112?
Red_3D#3062: what
Ecconia#4929: What... No, what Daniel said applies in Germany too. <[newline]> 110 is just police. 112 is the generic one: police/fire/hospital.
Red_3D#3062: Germany is quite different when it comes to emergency numbers
Red_3D#3062: interesting
DanielGJ44#4557: It's my understanding that 112 is the universal one but most advanced countries any number emergency number will get you the emergency operator
Red_3D#3062: interesting
Stefan#5422: <@284602593597194250> that only works per country otherwise try 112
Deleted User#0000: gonna go make myself have a heart attack to call 110 in america brb
Red_3D#3062: Let's call 911
Deleted User#0000: but i also do
Deleted User#0000: i dont wanna try
Red_3D#3062: Idk
Red_3D#3062: As in... 110 would also go to a 911 thing
Deleted User#0000: probably not
Red_3D#3062: Wait, ain't the emergency numbers routed to the nearest station regardless of which on you call?
Deleted User#0000: safer place to whistleblow epic us gaming info
Deleted User#0000: while i'm in russia
Deleted User#0000: no
Red_3D#3062: They definitely will
Deleted User#0000: while i am in the uk
Deleted User#0000: the german police will protect me from the us tanks
Red_3D#3062: lol
Deleted User#0000: good to know incase i have anything to whistleblow
Deleted User#0000: nice
Red_3D#3062: It be german police
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: some emergency number i'm to murrican to understand
Deleted User#0000: probably the weird europe number
Red_3D#3062: German police is very competent when it comes to tanks
Deleted User#0000: the fuck is that
Red_3D#3062: Try 110
Deleted User#0000: shit
Deleted User#0000: 991
Deleted User#0000: they said to call the police
Deleted User#0000: well
Red_3D#3062: I think 911 won't help you with that
Red_3D#3062: Lol
Deleted User#0000: *991 whats your emergency?* Yes I think a Main Battle Tank is following my computer and  watching my everymove waiting to strike

Dragon Lord#6944: especially in places that need to transport things away from theirselves while having their portal lead out in the center of a lava lake
Dragon Lord#6944: the air would be a lot of updrafts around lakes with drafts towards the shore where air is allowed to cool more. might be useful for unpowered baloon transport
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *especially* cargo transportation
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Not only would it make travel faster, it would also make travel less hard on the ecosystem
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And even if it's unsafe, train networks could be built to run automated cargo trains on
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But, I agree, if it could be made safe, it'd be amazing for travel
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Not to mention dangerous ghosts (which somehow collide with walls) which actively attack you
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And oxygen? Where would that come from?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I wonder how air moves around? It's an enclosed space after all (yes, it moves around, I know. I just don't know in what way)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That'll be a hard sell
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Everyone melts in the lava below
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If the plane accidentally hits the roof or something
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The only problem in the nether is
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Specifically steam trains but that wouldn't really work if your water vanishes
Deleted User#0000: speed travel
Deleted User#0000: 1.75 hours
Deleted User#0000: now imagine if it was more like
Deleted User#0000: tokyo -> new york is apparently around 14 hours
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But I like trains
Deleted User#0000: which means even faster transportation
Deleted User#0000: planes go faster than trains
Deleted User#0000: no, planes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Might as well use trains or something
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: There's no humans there
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: because `mmmmmmmmmm we must purchase all of this 8x reduction of distance even though there's infinite amount of it`
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Why use planes though
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Lol
Deleted User#0000: only planes are allowed entry
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Imagine the sea just not being able to enter
Deleted User#0000: it would be like
Deleted User#0000: if nether portals existed in real life
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because our country has flooded several times in the past. Most recently in 19something, with quite some deaths as a result
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Actually that'd be nice

Deleted User#0000: i mean i'm sure a lot of alzheimers patients and families would love to remove the plaques forming on their brain
Stefan#5422: You do not want to remove anything stuck inside your head
Deleted User#0000: oh shit
Deleted User#0000: you actually want to remove RAM sticks from your brain if you do in fact have them embedded into your brain
Deleted User#0000: attaching RAM to your brain actually sucks memory out of your brain in the same way
Deleted User#0000: that's why metal is often cold even if it's room temperature
Deleted User#0000: so you know how metal likes to `suck` energy
Stefan#5422: Ramming Ram into your brain isnt good
Deleted User#0000: ...no
Deleted User#0000: but wouldnt it be better for your brain because it would have more ram in it
Deleted User#0000: [proceeds to toss boomeRAM directly at friend's cranium, causing irreversible brain damage]

Red_3D#3062: I can hear the fans

Broyojo#2667: gpu go brrr

Red_3D#3062: ok
Red_3D#3062: changing the window has no effect on the fps
Red_3D#3062: the 512x512 is just the domain size though
Red_3D#3062: nah, am too lazy to change that much code
Broyojo#2667: render at 8k then downsample maybe
Red_3D#3062: let me see if I can change something in the code
Red_3D#3062: I cant make the window that large

Buzz#6223: God damn, randomly spewing out horny shit at any given opportunity was finally actually funny?
Jimmy#8080: The pun on "platonic", the specific weirdness of being sexually attracted to the Utah teapot, the contrast between a clinical discussion of geometry and an expression of lust -- not to overanalyze the joke, but it's a great one :P
Buzz#6223: Aaaaaaaa
Jimmy#8080: completely unsarcastic haha
Buzz#6223: I don't know when people are being sarcastic on the internet anymore but that barely qualifies as a joke so I'm gonna go with `yes sarcasm`
Jimmy#8080: <@!427964757492891649> usually I'd just leave a üòÇ reaction but that was too fucking funny. You had me laughing out loud for a solid thirty seconds. Great joke my dude.

Saltypretzel#0321: Back in the 8086 days that was handled by the math coprocessor
Saltypretzel#0321: The ‚ÄúMMX technology‚Äù and ‚ÄúAVX technology‚Äù in modern processors is to do floating point faster it‚Äôs basically an FPU inside of the processor
Dragon Lord#6944: and it lets you handle larger numbers! ||nevermind that you could do that already by using parallel operations on any number of bits and that even with 8/16 bit systems the bottleneck is usually cache speed... nevermind that quite a few 32 bit processors actually use 8 bit ALUs because of this...||

Verlio_H#0201: iit was cause 64 sounds cooler

Dragon Lord#6944: shouldn't be *too* big of a problem other than speed
Red_3D#3062: You can definitely allocate all the memory you want
Dragon Lord#6944: it has swap space, right?
Dragon Lord#6944: lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Let me tell you: windows doesn't give the slightest shit about how much memory you use

Deleted User#0000: but bikes are made in the world too
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Go by bike
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Don't buy cars
DanielGJ44#4557: I know someone who used that reasoning to not buy a toyota/honda
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Exactly
Deleted User#0000: dont buy cars from the entire world because all regions have done something bad
DanielGJ44#4557: that's still very much a thing and is the only reason some people buy American cars, btw
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yes, things have happened, and they should never happen again, but *that* germany is far from what the current germany is
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That's like saying "don't buy german cars cuz x many years ago terrible things happened because of that country!"
Deleted User#0000: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: and they are also just gonna ignore they're both gonna be made in china, cool
DanielGJ44#4557: maybe if any massive US company actually produced a decent product, I'd be open to buying US stuff

DanielGJ44#4557: most games I play require my thumb on the LS and face buttons, making it the "offset position"
DanielGJ44#4557: yeah that's certainly a preference thing as well
Deleted User#0000: i dont really like symmetrical analog sticks
Deleted User#0000: also personal preferance again
Deleted User#0000: i will say, the 360 we have does sound like a jet fan lol
DanielGJ44#4557: I have the original Xbox and the 360, I definitely got more use out of the PS2 and PS3 though
Deleted User#0000: and i havent really had any issues like that with mine
DanielGJ44#4557: Likewise, I've never enjoyed using a One or 360 - personal preference
Deleted User#0000: it just feels very slow half the time
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I know nothing about the new Xbox but I've watched some dev talks about the PS5 and it looks like a lot of thought went into it (I've never owned any console in either line so I have no predisposition to either)
Deleted User#0000: it might just be the console itself, but I've never had a good experience with our PS4
DanielGJ44#4557: I think cooling is probably going to be an issue on the PS5 vs. the SeX and the SeS
DanielGJ44#4557: I personally believe the PS5 is the more innovative console and it will provide the best user experience, but until I get my hands on it I am not gonna make a definitive opinion
Deleted User#0000: afaik
Deleted User#0000: why yes it is
DanielGJ44#4557: I thought the PS5 was 499

Deleted User#0000: switching to a new xbox tweet
DanielGJ44#4557: back when release date and pricing was revealed like more than 2 months before release
DanielGJ44#4557: I still remember the whole PS4/XOne thing when I was in school
DanielGJ44#4557: I don't understand the cavemanish behaviour by some people re: hardware releases but it is certainly funny to observe

DanielGJ44#4557: However, I cannot see the Xbox's claims of performance being true either; AMD has not competed to that level of TFlops even in enthusiast cards on a PC, don't understand why they'd hold that R&D cost back to only be on console
Deleted User#0000: not sure if they use the same exact chip

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Just replace them with like
Deleted User#0000: especially with wireless connection
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Fair enough
CrispyPin#1149: It could alter your movement so you avoid walking into them

Deleted User#0000: of course
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That sounds dangerous

CrispyPin#1149: But
CrispyPin#1149: Ye
Red_3D#3062: maybe some mice in some lab are sitting there with a machine writing to its brain
Deleted User#0000: whenever they start writing data tho
Red_3D#3062: I only heard about reading
CrispyPin#1149: But i'm not sure
Deleted User#0000: good
CrispyPin#1149: I don't think they have started writing data yet

CrispyPin#1149: if there is a way to hack them
Deleted User#0000: probably
CrispyPin#1149: tbh they could probably kill you or give you serious brain damage
Red_3D#3062: how nice
Deleted User#0000: rickrolls for days and days on end, injected directly into the brain
Deleted User#0000: is why you shouldnt be a early neuralink adoptor

DanielGJ44#4557: was considering replacing it with a Dell XPS but the Latitude is cheaper
DanielGJ44#4557: big F
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ouch üá´
DanielGJ44#4557: and I've stumbled upon Dell selling laptops with Ubuntu which is neat
DanielGJ44#4557: While that computer does have an 8th gen i7 I don't really believe it to be worth repairing
DanielGJ44#4557: pretty dumb
DanielGJ44#4557: So, the broken hinge on the laptop I sent an image of in here (I think yesterday) has broken the LCD on the laptop
Dragon Lord#6944: ^^

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That only transfers face positions to the main system
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: You use a second system
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: this is why
MetalQueer#2283: with the vtuber
MetalQueer#2283: just saw the one meme
MetalQueer#2283: NOOO
Saltypretzel#0321: Make LW able to communicate with dumb terminal
Dragon Lord#6944: ^^
Red_3D#3062: would still be nice
Red_3D#3062: ok
Dragon Lord#6944: unless you're loading the io (on lw side) in paralell, you'd be limited in the number of bits per second by the tickrate
Dragon Lord#6944: arduino has a base baude of 9600
Red_3D#3062: and I think you could transmit more with more io
Red_3D#3062: that would be fine for controlling simple stuff
Red_3D#3062: well
Dragon Lord#6944: (with default tick speed)
Dragon Lord#6944: the max speed you could really do straight from lw would be ~37 baude
Red_3D#3062: ok
Red_3D#3062: well
Dragon Lord#6944: might be weird having to accumulate the signals
Red_3D#3062: if you can haz C hashtag
Red_3D#3062: and probably not even that hard of a mod to make
Dragon Lord#6944: so many real uses of this :)
Red_3D#3062: that would be awesome
Dragon Lord#6944: dsp classes where you can make the circuits you're talking about trivially
Red_3D#3062: yes
Dragon Lord#6944: computer organization and design class that actually designs a computer without needing a super expensive piece of software
Dragon Lord#6944: yee
Red_3D#3062: that would also be such a great tool for teachers
Red_3D#3062: imagine pressing a button in game to turn your irl light on
Red_3D#3062: this would be amazing
Red_3D#3062: please
Red_3D#3062: yes
Dragon Lord#6944: serial tx/rx componont to communicate with arduino
Red_3D#3062: > i would love a lw computer controling a smart home irl XD <[newline]> that would be so ducking cool
Red_3D#3062: yeah, just something that my mind thought of lol
Dragon Lord#6944: i would love a lw computer controling a smart home irl XD
Dragon Lord#6944: not what i meant, but hype
Red_3D#3062: inb4 someone uses lw as the screen for their 8bit computer
Red_3D#3062: someone make a mod that can communicate to external devices
Red_3D#3062: oh yes
Red_3D#3062: yes
Dragon Lord#6944: make a microcontroler and plug it into peripherals XD
Dragon Lord#6944: :poggers:

DanielGJ44#4557: What you're seeing there is the rear cover and screen falling out of the hinge and the hinge protruding through the front bezel
DanielGJ44#4557: Current plan is to buy sheet metal and screw what is left of the hinge into that
DanielGJ44#4557: the hinge supports broke because there is no cross brace between the two hinges/screen supports
DanielGJ44#4557: No
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Put it in the microwave for fast charging
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's a feature

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I thought it was just about
Red_3D#3062: Yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: is the meme even about an array?
Red_3D#3062: And that fits nicely into this scene of the lion king
Red_3D#3062: > I'm not smart enough for red's meme :sad: <[newline]> : (, Local arrays have a fixed size that can be set by the number of elements in the curly brackets. They are like a start and end pointer but it's handled for you. So any address outside of the array is considered out of the bounds of the array.

Red_3D#3062: What
Nik#1011: $18
Red_3D#3062: I would say 50$ for everything
Nik#1011: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071L5YR25/
Red_3D#3062: :O
Jimmy#8080: My guess: $40
Jimmy#8080: :O
Nik#1011: <@!154964593397989376> jumping back to the topic of my mic, if you're stunned at the size to quality ratio, you'd also be surprised at the quality to price ratio

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The one where you use your feet
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Where we started with foot- err, soccer?

DanielGJ44#4557: what did you do in PE today <@!319035388868034560>
DanielGJ44#4557: it does happen that way
Red_3D#3062: > I fogot <[newline]> I hate when I forget how it looks outside
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Today was just cold though
DanielGJ44#4557: nah it wasn't warm lol
DanielGJ44#4557: specifically european and american football
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well, if it's warm it'd be fine
DanielGJ44#4557: I used to enjoy PE in the rain
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Also through the rain
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And a nice 20 minute trip back home, by bike ofc
DanielGJ44#4557: it was actually annoying, because it was just wet enough to need windshield wipers but not wet enough that they move smoothly; a shitty misty day
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Had PE out in the rain today
Jimmy#8080: I fogot

DanielGJ44#4557: the real meme is me buying a good mic so I won't sound like trash during online lectures and then my professors mic sounding like it came out of a mcdonald's happy meal
Stefan#5422: 2 kinds of people
DanielGJ44#4557: üò¶
Red_3D#3062: lmao
Stefan#5422: that makes me want to shatter your bones even more
DanielGJ44#4557: the whole process is designed to harden the exterior while retaining a little flexibility
DanielGJ44#4557: the outside, yeah, kinda, but only the outside of the material is most affected while retaining a little more malleability of the inside (unaffected) steel
Stefan#5422: aka more brittle
Stefan#5422: ah ok but that makes it more prone to shattering does it not?
Red_3D#3062: yes
DanielGJ44#4557: basically diffusing more carbon into steel to increase the rigidity of the outside layer
Stefan#5422: le explaine
Red_3D#3062: it makes stuff go *strong*
Red_3D#3062: ah
Red_3D#3062: Oo, whats that?

Red_3D#3062: yes
Red_3D#3062: : ]

DanielGJ44#4557: Sad!
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Rip
Red_3D#3062: when your windows vm commits die :(
Red_3D#3062: exactly
Red_3D#3062: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...the fact that this is sorted makes it a lot worse

Red_3D#3062: yes

Nik#1011: ok be right there
Red_3D#3062: get me pasta?
Red_3D#3062: lmao
Nik#1011: standard conversation with my mom
Red_3D#3062: the file contains all the data but when I copy the pixels I only get about half of it
Red_3D#3062: there are still errors in my code
Red_3D#3062: huh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Okay that's good then
Red_3D#3062: I always get the same image files back
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It does sound like a discord thing to do
Red_3D#3062: I dont think discord compresses images
Red_3D#3062: wrong file name
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yeah idk if discord does that
Red_3D#3062: oh
Red_3D#3062: the bmp should work
Red_3D#3062: uh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Inb4 discord compresses the images
Red_3D#3062: that looks so cool
Red_3D#3062: 
Red_3D#3062: :O
Red_3D#3062: that is nice
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I am quite pleased that the largest bottleneck in my program currently is the speed at which your hdd can read/write data
Red_3D#3062: not it be giving be one high images
Red_3D#3062: uh
Red_3D#3062: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: When u switch from debug to release and the processing time goes from 10 minutes to 0,5
Red_3D#3062: oof
Red_3D#3062: darn, cpp is fast
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Nice
Red_3D#3062: I was too stupid to use my own struct
Red_3D#3062: nvm, fixed it
Red_3D#3062: no, I dont think so
Red_3D#3062: uh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Or double pointers or whatever
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: No incorrect pointers?
Red_3D#3062: I checked how many bytes should be written, the values I entered, everything.
Red_3D#3062: I use the same code to write the values as everything else, but it just wont work
Red_3D#3062: argh, it works if I manually change the garbage.
Red_3D#3062: ah, it is writing the right length of garbage instead of 0
Red_3D#3062: but for some reason it is broken now
Red_3D#3062: I like the pattern that appear
Red_3D#3062: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well it sure is a colorful image
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Darn
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But bmp is still easier
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Tga is also pretty decent
Red_3D#3062: yes, thats why I use it
Red_3D#3062: lmao
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Tfw discord doesn't embed world's easiest image format
Red_3D#3062: oh duck dc
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yeah
Red_3D#3062: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Your converter
Red_3D#3062: yes
Red_3D#3062: what
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That was for turning them into colorful images wasn't it
Red_3D#3062: huh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <@284602593597194250> that was...
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Rant over, let's continue the conversation
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That screen I sent in <#631004929762525204> ? That's from a tool someone wrote to bruteforce all possible links on their site for finding song packs (which are paid!), Because they just let you download them without any verification
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...and now everyone uses that ID because it has all the DLC packs and taito doesn't do anything about it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But someone decided to share their ID with the world
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Which is fine
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The mobile version of the game for example has an id-based login system for example
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Despite their legal team, they are hopelessly bad at programming...
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I'd love to try and use the tracks for a small project on psp
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *but*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Creating new content mostly, since taito has quite an active legal team
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Planning on reimplementing the game or creating new content?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And now in three days I figured out most of the game's "song" format (so that is camera + track + model placement & movement + notes)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The steam version uses the aqualead framework which is a gigantic PITA, that's what I worked on 3 months ago
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I've got most of the game files figured out now
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And started again two days ago
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I worked on it like 3 months ago
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yes it was directed to you lol
Red_3D#3062: > I don't think it was directed at me, but on groove coaster reverse engineering stuff <[newline]> that also sounds very cool
Red_3D#3062: lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't think it was directed at me, but on groove coaster reverse engineering stuff
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I need to take a look at that, it seems really cool mate
Red_3D#3062: please, dont look at the code once it is on github
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ah
Red_3D#3062: fixing my .tungboard to bmp converter
ForLoveOfCats#4111: If I may ask
ForLoveOfCats#4111: What are you working on?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Depending on what filetypes you're doing operations on
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Sometimes it just continues without warning you
Red_3D#3062: lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Sometimes it errors out
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh God I just realized how incredibly inconsistent I am with error handling
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: #define thing_you_type thing_that_it_ends_up_being
Red_3D#3062: yep
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I believe it's
Red_3D#3062: it is the other way around
Red_3D#3062: ah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: For being the #1 version control platform, github sure has an awful code viewer in their mobile app
Red_3D#3062: no
Red_3D#3062: argh
Red_3D#3062: yes, that works
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yes I have to fix that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: #define then?
Red_3D#3062: make it stop
Red_3D#3062: oh god
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: 
Red_3D#3062: visual studio says "no"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: U just go
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Like when the compiler yells at you for using const char as string
Red_3D#3062: lmao
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's me
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Because if there's anyone that follows bad practices
Red_3D#3062: thanks for the tips
Red_3D#3062: But I am bad at programming lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Don't take that as a "ur bad at programming lmao"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I have just been telling you about better practices (imo) but
Red_3D#3062: I will
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: \:(
Red_3D#3062: ok ok
Red_3D#3062: Not poggers
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yes
Red_3D#3062: no
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Now typedef (or define) uint16_t as u16
Red_3D#3062: well, I try to keep it within reason
Red_3D#3062: haha
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: How bout yours?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But my code quality sucks
Red_3D#3062: lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ~~mostly cuz it's less typing tho hehe~~
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: So you can always see exactly what you're writing to your file
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Whenever using files I like to use types which tell me exactly how large they are
Red_3D#3062: yes 16bit
Red_3D#3062: short is 2bytes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Short is 16 right
Red_3D#3062: uh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: u16
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Uint16_t or
Red_3D#3062: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *unsigned short??*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Now I can understand unsigned int but
Red_3D#3062: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: *unsigned int*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Do I see
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oof
Red_3D#3062: couldn't you say that earlier?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...though my code can use some other improvements
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But I should
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ~~I just thought this up to the spot I've never actually used it lol~~
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Especially when you make tools that basically do nothing but read and write to and from files
Red_3D#3062: huh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: All my homies hate writing reinterpret_cast
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: #define wrchar(x,y) write((char*)(x), y)
Red_3D#3062: what's that?
Red_3D#3062: huh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: You can use something I call big brain
Red_3D#3062: oh god
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: When using file writes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Personal thing
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Ps
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Oh I love it
Jimmy#8080: beauty
Red_3D#3062: oh god
Red_3D#3062: you are evil
Jimmy#8080: Whenever I do so, I switch the font to comic sans, just to fuck with him
Jimmy#8080: I have a friend whom I sometimes send screenshots of my code to
Dragon Lord#6944: A true programmer sets their ide's font to purisa bold oblique.
Red_3D#3062: I just had a calm, casual conversation about someone having a different opinion than me in the YouTube comment section.

Red_3D#3062: I will assume that it goes at least 5m
Stefan#5422: assume everything that makes it simpler
Stefan#5422: yes
Red_3D#3062: do we assume a constant air density?
Stefan#5422: <@!284602593597194250>  do distance calc for a baseball at march 1.3 with a firing angle of precisely 45 degrees
Stefan#5422: Huh
Red_3D#3062: that baseball went ducking mach 1.3
Stefan#5422: umm
Red_3D#3062: definitely if you fired that thing.
Red_3D#3062: yes
Stefan#5422: In germany you probably would get swatted
Red_3D#3062: they manufactured that in their garage
Red_3D#3062: build by some random people, yes.
Stefan#5422: That's a artillery piece

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Drake has a tendency to break OS installations beyond repair, hence my joke for him to stay away from the project
Stefan#5422: mhm...
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It's the name of the OS that Andreas is writing (and a word meaning "the state or quality of being serene, calm, or tranquil")
Stefan#5422: What is a Serenity
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ?
Stefan#5422: Again what does that mean

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Andy then cracked the joke with Andreas' name resulting in him changing the quote "I am become death, destroyer of worlds" to play into the joke <[newline]> Andreas is the lead developer of SerenityOS <https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/> <[newline]> Andy is the lead developer of Zig <https://github.com/ziglang/zig>
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Andreas posted a poll about people's opinions on using nicknames vs irl names for contributing to FOSS projects, nicknames heavily won out hence his tweet about code is king
Stefan#5422: I mean we have no clue

DanielGJ44#4557: I wouldn't be able to get the support of the left or the right
DanielGJ44#4557: It's something I considered after high school, but I think I am too moderate to do anything other than municipal (non-partisan) politics
FacePox#2708: though with my beliefs I could probably make it only as far as house of representatives
FacePox#2708: Recent events have made me want to be a politician
DanielGJ44#4557: pretty sure the US, Canada, UK, Australia, Russia etc. would withdraw/not start anything if they thought it would have significant repercussions/invasions on their own soil
DanielGJ44#4557: People only want war if it doesn't affect their way of life
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Some people might "want" war, but those are not aware of what war is actually like
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: At least
DanielGJ44#4557: so, like 95% of people
FacePox#2708: True
DanielGJ44#4557: well that is incorrect, but I don't think a majority of non-politically or global-financially motivated people want war
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: No, and they weren't exactly treated that well after the war either, cuz "it was the germans fault!"
FacePox#2708: Cough cough eternal war in the Middle East
DanielGJ44#4557: I don't think anyone is "in favour" of war
Red_3D#3062: they just wanted a better life and listened to the wrong people
Red_3D#3062: well, I don't think they liked it.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Nobody really likes war normally
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I mean
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I don't think the German inhabitants really liked the war all that much themselves, honestly
DanielGJ44#4557: was gonna go back on that and say that technically we weren't Canadian then, but we were British beforehand and the statement is still accurate
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The German government at the time
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Or rather
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Not our fault for not taking the side of the germans
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Well fair enough
DanielGJ44#4557: We had to save their asses in WWII, that's how I see it üòâ
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I mean... While world war 2 was more recent, somewhere in "the golden age", as it's called here, we did slavery and mass colonization and whatnot
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Dutch people are seen as people with a good history

Zaxabock#0013: Tutorialspoint I can respect, they are AA
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yeah it‚Äôs not the greatest quality but
Zaxabock#0013: Cheap flaky electronics and thousands of (no offense) broken English indians trying to make it big on youtube

Red_3D#3062: encoding is easy
Stefan#5422: I didn't bother to decode
Red_3D#3062: I think the best thing you could do is rank all possibilities by how close they are to correct english words

Red_3D#3062: lmao

spider8ite#3222: starting with the first til the last
spider8ite#3222: and then you just append the nth letter of each word to the nth element
spider8ite#3222: the list has as many elements as the longest word in the plaintext has characters
spider8ite#3222: you just have a list of words
spider8ite#3222: lmao
spider8ite#3222: nooo red
spider8ite#3222: oh wait
spider8ite#3222: they do though lmao
spider8ite#3222: chances are it's ryan's cipher method
spider8ite#3222: and also if you see a lot of "t" in the first word, "h" in the second word, and {vowel} in the third word
spider8ite#3222: the problem with ryan's is that it'd be very easy to detect based on how quickly it drops off after the 5th "word" in the ciphertext
Red_3D#3062: The first letter of the last three don't go in the first row
spider8ite#3222: anyway
spider8ite#3222: what?
Red_3D#3062: Uh, this is stupid. I have to check for every word In the English dictionary because of the last three bits

spider8ite#3222: `that`
spider8ite#3222: then i looked at the first letters then i realized `oh there's a message here`
Red_3D#3062: > saw the encoding <[newline]> You are part of *The Oracle*, you can just see things
spider8ite#3222: like at first i tried rearranging the words around but they weren't really anagrams
Red_3D#3062: Time to write a simple (what's that encoding method called?) encoder & decoder
spider8ite#3222: lmfao
spider8ite#3222: saw the encoding
spider8ite#3222: i am surprised in myself that i just sorta
Red_3D#3062: The phrase itself, the fact that it was encoded and that google translate was used to send us that text

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <@350975527324221451> what's the model name?
Red_3D#3062: Rule 420: if it has a cpu and some memory (maybe even a screen and some buttons) it can run doom
Red_3D#3062: well, you can do other stuff with those 4 functions
RyanT#1426: Ok, mabye on my model but there's no way DOOM can run on a standard 4 function calculator
Red_3D#3062: you might even be able to get the buttons working
Red_3D#3062: > adding more memory is modifying it <[newline]> yes, but it would still run on the calculators cpu & display
Red_3D#3062: you can't expect many fps, but I am sure you could get it working on it if you really wanted to
RyanT#1426: adding more memory is modifying it
Red_3D#3062: and it can do large calculations is just under a second
RyanT#1426: i mean if i can run with the same amount of rom and ram
Red_3D#3062: well, you might have to replace some memory chips
RyanT#1426: this calculators "OS" prob. isnt that complex
Red_3D#3062: I think it would do something
Red_3D#3062: and use the ram

RyanT#1426: oh
RyanT#1426: how do you know the amount of rom in my calculator model
Red_3D#3062: but then you would need additional ram for storing variables
Red_3D#3062: if you replace the os maybe
Red_3D#3062: hmm
Red_3D#3062: the game is 2.4mb
Red_3D#3062: well
Red_3D#3062: uh
RyanT#1426: i dont think this has enough rom/ram to code DOOM
Red_3D#3062: well, the res might be low, but I am pretty sure that you could put some hacky components in there.

Red_3D#3062: 10/10 comment``` <[newline]> at this point, im convinced doom and crysis are two sides of the same coin. <[newline]>  <[newline]> one can run on anything, and the other runs on nothing. <[newline]> ```

Stefan#5422: Chrome tells me to change the "password" password for my localhost
Red_3D#3062: and you know how much the internet loves to annoy everyone they can get their hands on
Red_3D#3062: well, it is not much effort.
RyanT#1426: i think thats to much effort just to annoy 1 person

DanielGJ44#4557: might as well talk here as all the other channels just devolve into a Windows-Linux war
DanielGJ44#4557: My PlayStation 1, laptop, phone, and iPad were all built at Foxxconn, all by different OEMs, now that's a big meme
Red_3D#3062: Haha, so much fun.
Zaxabock#0013: Wow that is a big meme ;D
DanielGJ44#4557: one of the current corporate-hate buzzwords is Foxconn and how bad they treat their workers, but I REALLY don't think people understand the sheer amount of things that are built by Foxconn
Red_3D#3062: Yeah, it is kinda a big mix. It is so crappy but the things they give us are also so great
DanielGJ44#4557: like everyone bitches about it, but here I am typing on my laptop with my phone on me that were definitely not ethically sourced
DanielGJ44#4557: I sincerely think that a majority of the time companies don't even care
Red_3D#3062: It is very interesting that such a big gap even exists considering how much they are in contact
Red_3D#3062: It is going to be a very difficult time getting the whole world to agree on those very important things
DanielGJ44#4557: many of those countries view any sort of push to change that from companies as "foreign interference" and it's a good way to get your supply chain blacklisted
DanielGJ44#4557: if the only country that has what you need has no labour laws, what else are you supposed to do
Red_3D#3062: Am not sure how much the material gathering will be able to change though
Red_3D#3062: I am looking forward to what the future has for us
DanielGJ44#4557: I'd even argue in most regions an electric car would be more polluting, and while I do have research to back that up, more research needs to be done
Red_3D#3062: Also a big deal in the computer area
DanielGJ44#4557: In many large regions, for the average lifecycle of a car, it's less polluting to produce and drive a gas-powered vehicle
Red_3D#3062: Yes, that whole thing is also not considered by most people
DanielGJ44#4557: and there's more to sustainability than just not polluting while driving, mining for all of the metals in a battery has a huge carbon footprint and causes environmental harm in general
Red_3D#3062: I have thoroughly enjoyed your input
DanielGJ44#4557: business ethics and environmental sustainability are important topics though, I wanted to provide my input on the conversation
DanielGJ44#4557: very true
Red_3D#3062: <#403343343775383552> was very on topic today lmao
Red_3D#3062: lol
DanielGJ44#4557: and providing all of their automotive patents to others is a pro gamer move
DanielGJ44#4557: They are primarily a luxury/performance car brand with the added benefit of reducing emissions
Red_3D#3062: Thats true, but they have made some advances in batteries and stuff. Let's see what happens in the next years
DanielGJ44#4557: I am OK with Tesla receiving money, and any other manufacturer that is trying to actually innovate, but Tesla isn't really "for the people" yet IMO
Red_3D#3062: lol, I think it depends on what part of auto manufacturers the money goes to. If it goes into parts that actually make cars better I am fine with it. If it just gets pumped into the actually manufacturing of cars it's a different story.
DanielGJ44#4557: and it's not like what they do produce has any decent level of reliability anymore
DanielGJ44#4557: Ford, GM and Chrysler should have collapsed and/or restructured several years ago. Little to no innovation/research has come from GM or Chrysler in the past 20 years (they still sell cars on chassis designed in the 90s)
DanielGJ44#4557: hey, I am studying to be an automotive engineer, and even I think government funding should be stopped for auto manufacturers
Red_3D#3062: Research is fine imo
Red_3D#3062: Well, I am not an expert in American taxes but tax money probably should not be spend on luxury things.
DanielGJ44#4557: I would argue the largest ethics issue is the amount of taxpayer money that has gone into manufacturing luxury vehicles that the average person will have no chance of owning
Red_3D#3062: Well, the government probably wants the companies to succeed. Making rockets cheaper is always nice
DanielGJ44#4557: and even SpaceX was basically burning money until recently. Without government support, both Tesla and SpaceX would likely be very dead by now
DanielGJ44#4557: also, the main things that have made him money were PayPal and SpaceX. Tesla still hasn't pulled a full (4 consecutive quarters) year of profits and pretty much continues to lose money annually - correction, Tesla JUST had it's 4th consecutive profitable quarter reported in July
DanielGJ44#4557: I will say that I am not a fan of Tesla and I will not consider their cars ever, but they have made efforts to make their sourcing sustainable and ethical
Red_3D#3062: Hmm, the only things I can find under those terms are how some materials in Tesla batteries are bought from somewhere where there might be child labor. <[newline]>  <[newline]> I am not an expert in that area but I think that it is not directly his fault. although I think that if there are better alternatives they should be used.
Red_3D#3062: I can't find any information on that on his wiki and always thought he got his first big money from selling PayPal

DanielGJ44#4557: Possibly, I am referring to the open forums now though when someone asks "how to max performance in (program) with (specific existing hardware)" and the answers is a bunch of "lol dumby, just buy a $500 processor instead" and not actually answering the question
Zaxabock#0013: Wait, wasn't this discussed earlier in another thread? üòÇ It seems so familiar
DanielGJ44#4557: same with AMD/NVidia
DanielGJ44#4557: I've actually seen it go both ways, in that regard
DanielGJ44#4557: like that doesn't help the person who already purchased the Intel processor several years ago
DanielGJ44#4557: or the PC gaming scene, "what is the recommended overclock speed for (Intel processor)" and almost ALWAYS there's some edgelord with the immediate "don't do that, Buy an AMD processor bro"
Zaxabock#0013:

Zaxabock#0013: Guys, how does Bruce Wayne charge his inventions?
Red_3D#3062: worst case would still only require time
Red_3D#3062: the threads finish at different times, and they only wait for each other when writing to the file
Red_3D#3062: thread id is basically the number of the password it generated
Red_3D#3062: still the time and thread id
Red_3D#3062: yes, I probably should
Saltypretzel#0321: Wait where are you getting seeds from anyways
Red_3D#3062: well
Saltypretzel#0321: So no one can reverse seed you
Saltypretzel#0321: Well to make pseudorandom passwords even more safe, you can mix around the output numbers and letters
Red_3D#3062: note to self: [multithreading passwords is totally unnecessary] but now I got all the passwords I am ever going to need for at least 10 lifetimes and each and every one of them is basically uncrackable
Red_3D#3062: 30mb of passwords in no time
Red_3D#3062: computers are already *very very very* fast
Red_3D#3062: lmao
Saltypretzel#0321: Instead of ‚Äúupgrading your computer‚Äù upgrade your ‚Äúlava lamps‚Äù
Saltypretzel#0321: And the more lava lamps, the more numbers
Red_3D#3062: well, does it change 4069 times a second?
Red_3D#3062: ok
Saltypretzel#0321: Well microwaves move fast, so the number should change pretty quickly
Red_3D#3062: still only so much data you can read from that
Saltypretzel#0321: Another one used double pendulums because those are chaotic
Red_3D#3062: that sound cool
Saltypretzel#0321: Well some place used lava lamps to get random numbers
Red_3D#3062: and you can only read so much data of that antenna
Red_3D#3062: but it is very easy to do
Red_3D#3062: I did not say that someone actually would
Saltypretzel#0321: Well how would someone know if it is in a private place. And you could just use a tv antenna
Red_3D#3062: that would be very impractical and could be tampered with by others
Saltypretzel#0321: Well just turn the background microwave radiation to numbers and it‚Äôs really random
Red_3D#3062: but I use time and the thread id
Red_3D#3062: there is no real random number generation
Red_3D#3062: well
Saltypretzel#0321: Is it real random or pseudorandom?
Red_3D#3062: well, it would take some time to hash
nice#6969: Imagine a 4000000 char long password, hashed
Red_3D#3062: yes

Red_3D#3062: ok, random password generation is multithreaded now. <[newline]> does anyone want 4069 512 char long passwords?

FacePox#2708: 
FacePox#2708: Nice thesis bro
Zaxabock#0013: Not everyone is so lucky to have mental support tho, that's a fact. Could be because of poverty, or stubbornness. Fear for what people might say or do if they find out you're seeing a psychiatrist is a big setback. There are so many factors.
Zaxabock#0013: Some would say surviving bullying at an early age makes you emotionally stronger, since you learn to shrug things off.. That can be good and bad, depending on how much empathy you manage to save. I dunno.
Zaxabock#0013: You'll be judged no matter what, we are a lot of differing humans.. And it's up to you how to respond to that judgment
Zaxabock#0013: A group of friends can be anything, from childhood school buddies to biker gangs and way worse things
Zaxabock#0013: You can get by in life without any friends but they are, to most, a very very nice bonus
Zaxabock#0013: Sometimes we learn, other times we close ourselves off into dreamland
Zaxabock#0013: We deal with it one day at a time and see where it takes us
Zaxabock#0013: Life is complicated
Zaxabock#0013: People always gather into groups they feel a connection with no matter how vague it may be, good or bad
FacePox#2708: Anyways the point is I have a probably misplaced level of compassion for incels because I understand the feeling of falling through the cracks.
Zaxabock#0013: I like Joker's quote, from the movie
Zaxabock#0013: Others reach out to institutions made to support such groups
Zaxabock#0013: Some of them refuse to admit they have difficult feelings over it. They refuse help and want their gratification no matter the cost
FacePox#2708: and the mainstream media just dunking on them kinda proves their point
Zaxabock#0013: That is true, and scary things have happened because of people being pushed into a corner of desperation
FacePox#2708: I feel like the feeling of being completely abandoned and neglected by society is enough to push anyone into some fucked up coping mechanisms
Zaxabock#0013: It is understandable but not justified to lash out at people for feeling abandoned
FacePox#2708: it really sucks feeling like no one loves you
FacePox#2708: and I've been on their forums before
FacePox#2708: to be fair
Zaxabock#0013: Incel / femcels think the world owes them something, I think. Never studied that behavior üòÖ
FacePox#2708: I think I got into that weird incel-esque (new word!) mindset that sex would fix all of my problems
Zaxabock#0013: I mean if you're unhappy in your own company, that is most times visible, and it doesn't give a good motivation to others to be around you :b <[newline]> Sure friends can be happy and cheerful and support you, but you can't base your existence on the approval of others, that's unhealthy
FacePox#2708: didn't make me less sad though ü§î
Zaxabock#0013: You're with yourself all the time so it's important learning to like who you are
FacePox#2708: but I got a girlfriend about halfway through my career as a 17 year old
FacePox#2708: I wish I had an inspiring story about how I learn ed to live with myself
FacePox#2708: I got really lonely and upset about not being in a relationship when I was 16
Zaxabock#0013: They get pressured because "it's cool and popular", etc
FacePox#2708: ouch
Zaxabock#0013: I know teens who're kinda suicidal about being virgins at 12-14 years, it's a sad reality
Zaxabock#0013: Lol, it's not directed solelly at you ;P
FacePox#2708: I was just more confused about the age of the kid
FacePox#2708: what do you take me for?

Red_3D#3062: that sounds nice
Red_3D#3062: :O
DanielGJ44#4557: my coding education basically goes from knowing nothing to being able to program a car's microcontrollers and a bit of self-driving logic
Red_3D#3062: together with the basic syntax and so on
Red_3D#3062: yes, that is basically coding 101
Zaxabock#0013: Modulus Magicus
Red_3D#3062: lmao
DanielGJ44#4557: I don't know the full scope but what you listed was literally day 1 of university coding
Red_3D#3062: yes, far more interesting
Red_3D#3062: oh
DanielGJ44#4557: well this one is more about doing algebraic equations and integrals, beyond to infinite/finite series, etc
Red_3D#3062: sorry
Red_3D#3062: I feel like that is insultingly oversimplified
Red_3D#3062: the [this is how you] +,-,*,/,%,++,-- class
Red_3D#3062: ah yes
DanielGJ44#4557: I have a class specifically on performing mathematic operations throughout code
DanielGJ44#4557: fair enough
Red_3D#3062: but that would be *too* simple lmao

DayDun#2309: it's addition
Stenodyon#8192: hmmm
DayDun#2309: nope
Stenodyon#8192: that looks like a random number generator
DayDun#2309: try figuring out what it does
DayDun#2309: something I actually stumbled upon once though is this <[newline]> ```java <[newline]> public static int m25783(int i, int i2) { <[newline]>   while (i2 != 0) { <[newline]>     int i3 = i ^ i2; <[newline]>     i2 = (i & i2) << 1; <[newline]>     i = i3; <[newline]>   } <[newline]>   return i; <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```
DayDun#2309: that works too
Stenodyon#8192: literal stack overflow
Stenodyon#8192: ```cpp <[newline]> bool is_even(int n) { return n == 0 ? true : !is_even(n-1); } <[newline]> ```
DayDun#2309: how professionals do it
DayDun#2309: ```java <[newline]> private bool IsEven(int number) { <[newline]>   while (true) { <[newline]>     if (number == 0) return true; <[newline]>     if (number == 1) return false; <[newline]>     number -= 2; <[newline]>   } <[newline]> } <[newline]> ```

Deleted User#0000: its my joke about how I could not type earlier
Red_3D#3062: And I don't think many people are gonna be interested in 8D Chess

spider8ite#3222: ok
Red_3D#3062: ok
spider8ite#3222: they were called zenzers
spider8ite#3222: they weren't called genders
DanielGJ44#4557: and not even calling them genders in game
DanielGJ44#4557: I would expect something more like a Character A and Character B or something that has basically no connotations to existing genders
spider8ite#3222: "there is no zenzerlez or zon-zizazi option"
spider8ite#3222: "these are the only options"
spider8ite#3222: "are you a zale or a zezale"
spider8ite#3222: you open a game and it's like
DanielGJ44#4557: It's an intricate topic I admittedly do not know all of the science behind
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: But in most well-developed and (self proclaimed) 1st world countries, it is a preference you can freely have
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: There‚Äôs still plenty of countries where it‚Äôs far from acceptable to ‚Äúdiffer from the norm‚Äù
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: actually, it‚Äôs not just a preference in some countries
DanielGJ44#4557: I am just proposing hypothetical scenarios to encourage conversation
DanielGJ44#4557: fair enough
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: And even then there's plenty of options to adopt kids etc, so it's now completely a personal preference
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The time will come when it matters, but that time is not now
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Personally I wouldn't care much, because I don't care much for gender in the first place
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I still think many people won't buy it
DanielGJ44#4557: because that is theoretically different to having a different universe but using the same gender names
DanielGJ44#4557: what if there were 2 original genders in the game that don't parallel to any human genders
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If there was only one gender in that universe, for example, I think that'd already be a lot easier to live with for a lot of people
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Personally I'd be okay with that but I think that's too similar to our world for people to accept that "there's only two" in that universe
DanielGJ44#4557: what if the game takes place in a universe where only 2 genders exist
Jimmy#8080: Lots of folks aren't described by either of those words, there's no reason they should be excluded from the game
Jimmy#8080: I agree with painting person, there's no reason to restrict it to "he" and "she"
DanielGJ44#4557: Well

Red_3D#3062: yes
Red_3D#3062: hm
Ecconia#4929: Me continues derping: *listen to that man, he speaks truth!*
DayDun#2309: and OpenGL doesn't require you to use indices
Ecconia#4929: But its also important for me to know
DayDun#2309: I'm talking to Red_3D, not you
Ecconia#4929: How did I even write OpenGL up to this date, you opened my eyes man!
Ecconia#4929: They are NOT???!!!
DayDun#2309: indices and vertices are not the same thing
Ecconia#4929: Weird meme
Red_3D#3062: when you can not collapse a case in visual studio <:bobby_upset:692790277307367484>
Red_3D#3062: maybe that is the wrong mindset
Red_3D#3062: but I am not using *that* much memory so I would rather sacrifice that than those 15 nanoseconds
Red_3D#3062: I guess I could do some math on the vectors to figure out the length
Red_3D#3062: I think I actually need all of those values If I don't wanna do a bunch of if statements
Red_3D#3062: and it is not a multiple either
Red_3D#3062: oh god, indexCount != vertexCount
Red_3D#3062: I think, I might have to do some testing on that
Red_3D#3062: And passing in one int for less processing is something I am ok with
Red_3D#3062: Kinda yes, but That would require more processing and ram
DayDun#2309: I'm not very experienced with c++, but you could probably represent the verticies as `vector<array<float, 3>>` or something as well
Red_3D#3062: Will do that now, thanks for the tips
Red_3D#3062: Lol
Red_3D#3062: But I did that at 1am, do you really think I could have made an intelligent decision at that time
DayDun#2309: the size data is already stored in the vector so you're passing duplicate data
Red_3D#3062: Well yes
DayDun#2309: well just divide then
Red_3D#3062: color count and uv count depend on the model id
Red_3D#3062: But index Count = vertexCount
Red_3D#3062: Not really, vertices.size = 3 x vertexCount
FacePox#2708: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KXlSrcE8G4
DayDun#2309: <@!284602593597194250> vertexCount, indexCount, colorCount and uvCount can just be `vertices.size()` etc. right?

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Update on the pic I posted earlier of the new CPU. I've assembled the new system, it posts, my boot drive boots into grub and then the initramfs but then cannot find the correct drive UUID to continue booting which is an issue I've fixed before when moving this OS from the original disk to the ssd it is currently on. However all live USB media I've tried results in an input out of range error on the monitor after booting into their respective kernels (their grub menus are fine though). The onboard gpu has been disabled and I'm running a memtest currently which is almost halfway done with no errors. I'm confident that I'll be able to sort this out but this is proving to be an annoying issue

Deleted User#0000: what happened
Red_3D#3062: oh god
FalsePattern#7777: Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.
Red_3D#3062: calling that is also fun
Red_3D#3062: sometimes I am not sure if I even should separate my code

Red_3D#3062: ima tell python
DayDun#2309: that doesn't do the assignment
DayDun#2309: ...
Red_3D#3062: it would just be arr[i+4] though
Red_3D#3062: you can
Red_3D#3062: oh
Red_3D#3062: I don't think so
DayDun#2309: can you do something like `arr[i+=4]` in python though?
Red_3D#3062: oh god
CrispyPin#1149: Haha python go `arr[i:=i+4]`
DayDun#2309: when writing parsers I often end up writing stuff like `arr[i++]` a lot, but as soon as I need to increase `i` by more than 1 the code becomes a lot messier, I end up having to write `arr[i]; i += 4;` which is kind of ugly imo
DayDun#2309: would be nice to generalize that behaviour to more operations
DayDun#2309: such as `x++`
DayDun#2309: is delayed operations
DayDun#2309: well one thing that I've thought about actually
PseudoGoose#2841: maybe for eso / golf langs it would be considered
PseudoGoose#2841: `x = !x` is already concise and descriptive
PseudoGoose#2841: though we are also ignoring that the concept of an invert-assign operator would probably be defeated even before a syntax is decided
PseudoGoose#2841: not a problem in rust <:topkek:504572505638567946>
DayDun#2309: `*(x + 1) = y`
PseudoGoose#2841: eh i guess
PseudoGoose#2841: if the language even allows it to be overridden like that
DayDun#2309: you can have an expression on both sides of the assignment
DayDun#2309: if you override the operator you could right?
PseudoGoose#2841: the left hand side of an assignment is typically just a variable name
PseudoGoose#2841: you can't have `(x!) = ...`
PseudoGoose#2841: hmm
PseudoGoose#2841: actually...
PseudoGoose#2841: thanks
Bobby Bot#3513: Sorry, I don't know how to do that!
PseudoGoose#2841: != is not the same token as !
DayDun#2309: `x !=` or `x! =`
DayDun#2309: well what would `x!=` mean then
PseudoGoose#2841: two different positions in an expression, before and after
PseudoGoose#2841: its completely unambiguous
DayDun#2309: I'm not really sure if it would be possible to have the same character as both a prefix and suffix unary
Red_3D#3062: bye Obama

spider8ite#3222: factor real
spider8ite#3222: yes
Red_3D#3062: yes
Red_3D#3062: x factorial
spider8ite#3222: since !x is typically to invert
spider8ite#3222: or maybe it could just be shortened to `x!`
Red_3D#3062: just as a joke
Red_3D#3062: nah, it was like... Java != Javascript
spider8ite#3222: amazing
spider8ite#3222: you save a single character by not reusing `x` on the right side
spider8ite#3222: bc it's a unary operation
spider8ite#3222: `x!=;`
spider8ite#3222: would the line of code just be

Red_3D#3062: time to stop != true
Ecconia#4929: "Its time to stop" -> NO.
Red_3D#3062: ugh
DayDun#2309: technically `!=` could be interpreted to mean `x = !x` similar to how `+=` etc works
Red_3D#3062: ok

ForLoveOfCats#4111: A worn walking path is a trace left behind. Leaving no trace means to not litter or damage the ecosystem and the organisms which live there. Someone took the time to stack those stones so seeing them is in a way a connection to whoever was there to do that. Nature will knock it over in due time, all it takes is a small gust of wind or a scurrying critter running through the underbrush to knock it over. The person who set it up made a very small and extremely temperary mark on the area in a non-distructive way with what was already there.

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Probably, I saw some people talking about it a few days ago. It's a "suprising" feature in that it is not expected and I don't like it as when I post something it shouldn't hide the fact that I'm linking to an image hosted elsewhere but that's the world we live in now where "simplification" is the goal of so many UI designers. One example is how Chrome wants to start hiding all portions of the URL not part of the domain and Safari already does that

FalsePattern#7777: Xtreme Download Manager
Ruthenic#3083: what download manager is it?
FalsePattern#7777: iirc they do that for multiple files (like website content), but not for single large files. this manager just chops up the file into about 30+ smaller parts, and downloads them separately, then assembles the parts at the end, a bit like torrent blocks. (it abuses the download resuming protocol to do this)

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.```

Deleted User#0000: though i doubt it
Deleted User#0000: if you are a very RaNdOM!!! individual dropping a "cheeej" in the discord may help

Deleted User#0000: and which fish do not exist in mucho quantidad
Deleted User#0000: which fish it be
Zaxabock#0013: 6.5 tons fish was smuggled out of Norway in 2018 xD
Deleted User#0000: yeah i guess part of it depends on like
Zaxabock#0013: Atm it's $800 for illegall salmon fishing
Deleted User#0000: i can't fine-d exact numbers for that
Zaxabock#0013: Mmmhm, correct, but those $10 add up >:O
Deleted User#0000: 'cost varies from one state to another'
Deleted User#0000: if you have a license but you did not possess it at the time of fish, it's only $10
Deleted User#0000: $50 for first time offender <[newline]> afterwards, $100+ but under $500 usually
Deleted User#0000: after some research it seems
Zaxabock#0013: It DO be like that in Norway though, siiiick fines for fishing one fish too much while the trawlers are raking in tons :b

Deleted User#0000: okay jackson redstone
jackson535#1361: sandstorm isn't really what I'd label as trance, but its very close and uses the musical tastes and ideas of that time
jackson535#1361: and its punishing to many people to know that the style that they grew up with is long gone and is actively pushed away
jackson535#1361: there is an entire timeline of the fate of old edm, especially trance music, where it evolved, adopted drops, became more pop focused, and is now just a shell called "trance" filled with modern junk
jackson535#1361: if I was darude, and those artists made something like that, I'd be very upset
jackson535#1361: original sandstorm was the one that sounded like music
jackson535#1361: bruh
FacePox#2708: yeah it's like that image

Red_3D#3062: I have never heard of anyone saying that Nutella is some other gender though
Red_3D#3062: I generally use [das] because it is actually gender neutral (can't be used for living stuff though) <[newline]>  <[newline]> But some people have a very strong opinion about it/him/her being male/female
Red_3D#3062: wow
DanielGJ44#4557: <:bobby_thinking:692790276938399835>
DanielGJ44#4557: ü§î
Deleted User#0000: lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It contains nut so I'd say male
DanielGJ44#4557: because Nutella ends in "a" I think I would assign it feminine gender in french

Red_3D#3062: So much simpler
Red_3D#3062: Yes
Deleted User#0000: we must all communicate via telepathy
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Languages bad
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: English bad
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Dutch bad
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: German bad
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Anyways that was a useless spinoff
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ~~You'd almost think she's named after "hot cocoa" (as in hot chocolate milk), the same way other characters are~~
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Hmm
Red_3D#3062: (there is [das] but you can't use it for living things)
Deleted User#0000: lol
Red_3D#3062: Yes, it is just so painful to work with. <[newline]> And there aren't even any gender neutral ones, so you have to assign a gender to everything.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...hazelnut spread with cocoa
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It has no actual benefit to the language, like many other constructs, but this one just has to be an elaborate joke
Red_3D#3062: That is also one of the hardest things to learn when learning German.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I hate it when languages assign genders to objects, and then use that arbitrarily assigned gender in grammar
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Yeah that's fun about german
Red_3D#3062: Oh my, english peps don't have to worry about which gender to assign to inanimate objects. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Here in germany there are often debates about the gender of Nutella, they often occurr after someone uses a different gender for the pronoun of Nutella when asking for it/him/her. <- that sounds so ducking wrong is english
Zaxabock#0013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuRXVMSG3po

Broyojo#2667: 
Red_3D#3062: actually, it misinterprets other sounds as the notification sound. <[newline]> I guess that is because I am awaiting that sound or something
Red_3D#3062: my mind likes to make them when my headphones are on 0 volume as well
Red_3D#3062: you ever just hear the dc notification sound even if there is no computer near by?

Deleted User#0000: yes

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ummm Jimmy, I'm concerned. Suicide is not something to joke lightly about...

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Kurt does it for charity, his far lands journey is a fundraiser
ForLoveOfCats#4111: It feels a bit anti-climactic, Kurt's been walking for like ~6 years now and now someone else is the first to walk the whole distance
CrispyPin#1149: kurt is doing it for content maybe
Jimmy#8080: I expect it's that Kurt walks for about an hour a week, and this guy was doing lots and lots and lots of hours per week
Jimmy#8080: I have the same question
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I don't want to lessen the accomplishment, I'm just confused by this turn of events

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it just sounds fun is all
jackson535#1361: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I'm definetely not going to listen to it for more than like 10 seconds
jackson535#1361: it opens with a freaking axe blasting full volume
jackson535#1361: instead of opening with a primarily sine wave bass
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: no dithering also sounds... well, fun in it's own way
jackson535#1361: sorreh
jackson535#1361: caught me off guard lol
jackson535#1361: the audacity thing
jackson535#1361: yeee
Nik#1011: nice.
Nik#1011: it sounds just as impressive.
jackson535#1361: yes xd
Nik#1011: that's good
Nik#1011: "squarey" lol
jackson535#1361: also they both looked squarey in the waveform thing
jackson535#1361: that should limit our audio to a max of 7 positions
jackson535#1361: so since 1 bit gives us 6.02db of headroom
jackson535#1361: is -78.3db
jackson535#1361: exact attenuation of the 3 bit songs
jackson535#1361: your dynamic range gon
jackson535#1361: bing bong
jackson535#1361: 
jackson535#1361: 
jackson535#1361: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: so yes please do
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: de-ear-rapify is implying that it's earrape
jackson535#1361: "yes"
jackson535#1361: like -6db
jackson535#1361: should i de-ear-rapify it
jackson535#1361: looks promising
jackson535#1361: this
jackson535#1361: 
Nik#1011: in this vid he also implements his own improved audio system for these SFX which quadruples the bitrate of the sounds
jackson535#1361: yes
Nik#1011: and 3
Nik#1011: including 1 bit
Nik#1011: in the vid I linked, at 2:40 he plays the same audio sample at many different bitrates
jackson535#1361: to make sure 100%
jackson535#1361: I'll show you what im doing now
jackson535#1361: putting the new amplitude file back in
jackson535#1361: no not changed the amplitude
jackson535#1361: audacity kept reverting to 32 bit float whenever i changed the amplitude or did an export
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: yeah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or what audacity settings actually
jackson535#1361: audacity xd
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <@!491262532917657600> what did you use to export as 3 bit?
Nik#1011: it's in the context of playing audio files on the original nintendo gameboy
Nik#1011: this is a very good video about really low bitrate audio
Nik#1011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fooSxCuWvZ4
jackson535#1361: I'll try with fl studio
jackson535#1361: maybe it switched back to 32 bit float when it dithered
jackson535#1361: i pulled that from the audacity folder
Nik#1011: yeah.
jackson535#1361: is that the dithered one?
jackson535#1361: dang
jackson535#1361: bruh
Nik#1011: looks like way more than 7
jackson535#1361: 7 positions?
jackson535#1361: it should be
Nik#1011: that waveform has a lot of detail to it
Nik#1011: dude are you sure this is 3-bit audio?
jackson535#1361: yeah me too
Nik#1011: like for the quiet parts of the song (first and last second, for example) the control signal can basically be muted
Nik#1011: I wonder if it's possible to make the control signal quieter when it's not as needed
jackson535#1361: each bit is halving the amplitude of the noise/control signal
jackson535#1361: the noise is extremely quiet then
jackson535#1361: at 8 bits, it makes high definition 8 bit music completely viable
jackson535#1361: ikr
jackson535#1361: it is a controlled signal that compares itself to the original file, the 16 bit WAV, and then sort of intercepts the music waveform in a way that adds back much of the missing content
Nik#1011: I can't believe how good it sounds
Nik#1011: that's amazing!
Nik#1011: holy shit
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: not exactly white noise no, but it's what I think of when i hear this
jackson535#1361: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: well it's noise
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but for 3 bit, with such a detailed voice...
jackson535#1361: its not exactly white noise
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: the white noise is of course annoying
jackson535#1361: yeah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: that doesn't sound as bad as I imagined it
jackson535#1361: its still a 3 bit waveform
jackson535#1361: but the quality is almost entirely restored
jackson535#1361: yes, horrible loud white noise
jackson535#1361: is the magic of dithering
jackson535#1361: this
jackson535#1361: 
Jimmy#8080: This is my favorite cover of *Bulletproof* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKeVQca3kQo
Nik#1011: I see
jackson535#1361: these are actually 16 bit files but the audio waveform was reduced to 3 bit
jackson535#1361: and, disclaimer
Nik#1011: ok
jackson535#1361: do you want to hear something even more impressive with the same amount of bits
jackson535#1361: now
jackson535#1361: yes
Nik#1011: I mean..... earrapey but still not bad
Nik#1011: it's actually kinda cool
Jimmy#8080: not bad
jackson535#1361: 
jackson535#1361: yeetus
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I haven't, but it doesn't sound appealing

jackson535#1361: because undervolt cpu
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: photoshop handles it amazingly
jackson535#1361: I was nervous about bluescreening too during such a long render+export
Red_3D#3062: time to develop a new image format optimized for storing insanely large files
jackson535#1361: and it said, 6553`5`
Red_3D#3062: Oh no
jackson535#1361: "whats the maximum resolution of a png"
jackson535#1361: and then i googled
jackson535#1361: but it was acting goofy and aborting exports
jackson535#1361: it was originally 65536x65536
jackson535#1361: yes!
Red_3D#3062: But the fact that 64k is possible at all is amazing.
Red_3D#3062: Ask Linus with his 1TB of ram
jackson535#1361: i think thats the only reason its viewable on there
jackson535#1361: see disk activity vs ram
jackson535#1361: during render and stuff
jackson535#1361: paintdotnet seemed to transfer ram to the ssd
jackson535#1361: I was fascinated by the task manager during rendering

jackson535#1361: oh

Nik#1011: jackson wtf
Deleted User#0000: lol
Nik#1011: me when drake says he gave up on the original one
Deleted User#0000: so I used an online generator
jackson535#1361: 
Nik#1011: :(
Saltypretzel#0321: but just with skinnier lines
Deleted User#0000: yes I gave up on my original one because there is no way afaik to make a gradient
Saltypretzel#0321: nice that looks like the photoshop version
Nik#1011: instead of pasting it onto a clean gradient
Nik#1011: if you paste it onto the original jimmy PFP, the black borders make it seamless
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: I did end up using your picture template from up there
Nik#1011: oh is that my crop?
Nik#1011: pretty color I mean
Nik#1011: that's pretty tbh
Nik#1011: damn
Deleted User#0000: well this is looking better already
Saltypretzel#0321: that looks like if you put jimmy in a disco bar and also stole his guitar

Nik#1011: I know it's a secret I was just surprised at your effort levels
PseudoGoose#2841: is secret nik, dw i think i've figured out the hard parts now
PseudoGoose#2841: is probably a better question
Nik#1011: also you can just hue-shift the original jimmy PFP, paste this on top, and that effectively changes the background color (which works well because jimmy's black outline hides my poor crop job
PseudoGoose#2841: who here can actually proficiently use lisp
PseudoGoose#2841: who here loves lisp
Nik#1011: what the hell are you working on xD
Nik#1011: oh damn
PseudoGoose#2841: i'm practicing my script-fu

PseudoGoose#2841: i got it üòÑ
PseudoGoose#2841: no wait don't worry about it
Deleted User#0000: yea, this is all hand-drawn
Saltypretzel#0321: who needs help
Saltypretzel#0321: what
Saltypretzel#0321: photoshop does it all for you for 1/20 of the effort
PseudoGoose#2841: halp
Saltypretzel#0321: Nice for something without photoshop
PseudoGoose#2841: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Nik#1011: btw I think I just figured out an easy way to do this
Nik#1011: not bad
Nik#1011: haha
Deleted User#0000: pre-alpha
Saltypretzel#0321: and the music notes
Nik#1011: oh I just noticed two tufts of hair got hue shifted too
Nik#1011: mine's like *clean edges? what're those*
Nik#1011: wow that's way more precise than mine
Saltypretzel#0321: 
Saltypretzel#0321: ok if jimmy wants, here is a pride background
Deleted User#0000: teaser 2
Saltypretzel#0321: but i mean
Saltypretzel#0321: if jimmy wants a brown background, its up to him
Deleted User#0000: yes but ^
Nik#1011: AAH BROWN <:BabyRage:374410444447809536>
Saltypretzel#0321: 
Saltypretzel#0321: ok i made one but its brown so it is unusable, but a proof of concept
Deleted User#0000: (I should note I have been using GNOME which is bad on resources so that doesnt help either)
Nik#1011: yep
Nik#1011: maybe it's just firefox displaying transparency weirdly
Nik#1011: oh wait
Nik#1011: my last one didn't work when you downloaded the original so I'm trying again
Deleted User#0000: good luck having these things running though my computer dies with Discord and a youtube tab open
Saltypretzel#0321: i know, but you dont need that to make a gradient
Nik#1011: gimp has lots of adavanced tools and plugin support
Nik#1011: probably not as good as gimp
Saltypretzel#0321: or some online photoshop clones
Deleted User#0000: fair point
Nik#1011: which is mightly powerful
Nik#1011: everyone has access to GIMP
Deleted User#0000: not my fault the best tool I have is kolourpaint
Deleted User#0000: lol
Saltypretzel#0321: so ill leave it up to him
Saltypretzel#0321: but i dont want to steal Drake's fame
Saltypretzel#0321: wait... I can easily do this by using photoshop magic wand and a gradient tool
Deleted User#0000: ok thanks this will go in my archive
Nik#1011: maybe <@!118121598388666375> wants it
Nik#1011: take it anyway
Deleted User#0000: but thanks anyway
Deleted User#0000: no, at least the outline leaves less of a chance for it to look off and the head to be slimmed down
Nik#1011: might make it easier for you
Nik#1011: like, outline replaced with transparency
Nik#1011: <@456226577798135808> do you want my jimmy pic with the outline removed
jackson535#1361: wo
Deleted User#0000: yay
Nik#1011: my power is back
Nik#1011: oh yay
Deleted User#0000: yes you can finally have a pfp worthy of your old new-found favorite color
Jimmy#8080: HYPE
Deleted User#0000: a sneak peak on my jimmy pfp but blue v2
Saltypretzel#0321: yeah, you should probably turn the computer off or it can die and data can be corrupted
Nik#1011: anyway the only battery source we have is a UPS that my dad has plugged into his computer. It only has maybe 20 minutes left on it right now
Saltypretzel#0321: yeah. wall power isnt DC, you cant just plug AC into AC. Any slight difference in phase, voltage, waveform, or frequency = catastrophy
Nik#1011: you use the breakers to disconnect the wires in your wall from city power, then you generate your own power and plug it into the wall to power those wires yourself. It's a simple concept but it's definitely risky if the only thing stopping a catastrophy is 1 breaker
Saltypretzel#0321: jacob's ladder
Nik#1011: the guy in that vid
Nik#1011: whatever
Nik#1011: Mehdi
Nik#1011: this isn't the most dangerous thing that Medhi has demonstrated by a longshot
Saltypretzel#0321: backfeeding power is pretty illegal
Deleted User#0000: well boys it's kolourpaint time here once more
Nik#1011: you can technically die doing anything
Saltypretzel#0321: dont actually try this you can 1. die 2. get hurt 3. get in a lot of trouble
PseudoGoose#2841: just need to do a bit of script-fu
Saltypretzel#0321: ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At0advb9_fA~~

Nik#1011: hey for the record I didn't purposefully make his hair all disastrous like that. I removed the black lines by contrast, but then manually added his face and guitar strings back. Then I tried using blurring to restore the missing colors where the outlines were (seems like I missed a few stray black pixels)

Red_3D#3062: by the stress
Stefan#5422: oh I see where the unhealthy mentality is at

CrispyPin#1149: 1/3 instead of 1/2 of all integers
CrispyPin#1149: Instead of checking every odd number you can check every number one away from a multiple of 6
Red_3D#3062: 2000000 in seconds instead of 30+min
Red_3D#3062: Ok, primes are fast now.
Red_3D#3062: Hahaha, frick that little bug. Now it works.
Red_3D#3062: I think the problem appears because I only check even numbers. (the same thing happened in a test file). Now I just need to find where that happens in my main file.
Red_3D#3062: And stupid internet challenges.
Red_3D#3062: Oh, yes
Red_3D#3062: ?
Stefan#5422: Is it not the primery thing of security
DoctorVWA#1917: you're welcomea

Dragon Lord#6944: then i'll throw wood pelets to distract them
Red_3D#3062: What if hamsters come to hack you?
Dragon Lord#6944: password with the index 'x' takes x*access time to retrieve
Red_3D#3062: That sounds not very ideal
Dragon Lord#6944: in my ideal website everyone's password is stored in a single, one direction, unencrypted, ascii based linked list
Red_3D#3062: That would work.

Deleted User#0000: no
Deleted User#0000: opis
Deleted User#0000: open vorbis
PseudoGoose#2841: `.ogg` is just the container format
PseudoGoose#2841: yea
PseudoGoose#2841: opus is successor to vorbis
Deleted User#0000: i think it's also better quality at lower bitrates
Nik#1011: I confuse opus and vorbis all the time
Nik#1011: or wait, is that opus?
Nik#1011: it's optimized for voice I believe
PseudoGoose#2841: - that's all i know
PseudoGoose#2841: - is open source

daimondweter#8284: 8-¬°¬° people can be proud of their codes, I mean like: <[newline]> Be extra proud when you cleaned a whole city only with your toes, but be proud when you make a cool code.
Red_3D#3062: why?
Deleted User#0000: no
Red_3D#3062: yes
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: no
Red_3D#3062: you deserve to be proud.

Deleted User#0000: ok brb
Red_3D#3062: Unicode and utf-8 are a pain.
Red_3D#3062: I would not recommend it.
Deleted User#0000: lmao

DoctorVWA#1917: live overflow was advertising one recently
DoctorVWA#1917: me, they are cool
Deleted User#0000: i am now done
Deleted User#0000: ```cpp <[newline]> int SumFibonacci() { <[newline]>     double s5 = sqrt(5); <[newline]>     double PHI = (1.0 + s5) / (2.0); <[newline]>     int sum = 0; <[newline]>     int num = 0; <[newline]>     for(int i = 3; num <= 4000000; i+= 3) { <[newline]>         sum += num; <[newline]>         num = (pow(PHI, i) - pow(-1/PHI, i)) / s5; <[newline]>     } <[newline]>     return sum; <[newline]> }```
Red_3D#3062: Euler is much better (for me)
Red_3D#3062: I tried, but I did not stick to them.
daimondweter#8284: XD, did any of you also get on those weird CTF hacking websites?
Deleted User#0000: no it's not
Deleted User#0000: there this is better
daimondweter#8284: And what is it that makes alright so alright to me?
Red_3D#3062: lol
CrispyPin#1149: i think i did the easiest ones straight in the interpreter

Red_3D#3062: yes, you should
daimondweter#8284: Yep
DoctorVWA#1917: this website looks really cool, I should get on it
CrispyPin#1149: ok
Red_3D#3062: 2
CrispyPin#1149: what number is this
Deleted User#0000: actually hang on
Red_3D#3062: yes

Red_3D#3062: my ugly ass code: <[newline]> ```cpp <[newline]> #include <iostream> <[newline]>  <[newline]> using namespace std; <[newline]>  <[newline]> int main() { <[newline]>  <[newline]>     int max = 4000000; <[newline]>     int sum = 0; <[newline]>     int prev = 1; <[newline]>     int prevv = 0; <[newline]>     int curr; <[newline]>  <[newline]>     while(curr < max) { <[newline]>         curr = prev + prevv; <[newline]>         if(curr % 2 == 0) { <[newline]>             sum += curr; <[newline]>         } <[newline]>  <[newline]>         prevv = prev; <[newline]>         prev = curr; <[newline]>  <[newline]>     } <[newline]>  <[newline]>     cout << sum; <[newline]>  <[newline]>     cin.get(); <[newline]>     return 0; <[newline]>  <[newline]> }```
daimondweter#8284: I hope I already made some codes to solve them without knowing it
Red_3D#3062: nice
Deleted User#0000: w00t
Red_3D#3062: oh no

CrispyPin#1149: its always just a number
Red_3D#3062: you enter your solution
CrispyPin#1149: you have to enter the answer
Red_3D#3062: there is a box
daimondweter#8284: Do people check whether they solved it for themselves or is it made in a way that the website can check it for you?
CrispyPin#1149: you can also add ppl as friends to get access to their stats
daimondweter#8284: oof
Deleted User#0000: no

Deleted User#0000: wut
daimondweter#8284: That makes it pretty hard to do lol
CrispyPin#1149: thing is for most of the hard ones i don't understand the question
daimondweter#8284: 62 50%
daimondweter#8284: Cool lol
daimondweter#8284: lol
daimondweter#8284: 21
CrispyPin#1149: so far

CrispyPin#1149: yes they do
CrispyPin#1149: https://gyazo.com/8d37c1012f026bfa25255982f4c8d8dc
daimondweter#8284: Does 100% exist?
CrispyPin#1149: ive mostly done 5% ones
CrispyPin#1149: #587 is only 20%
daimondweter#8284: XD
Red_3D#3062: haha, cpu fan go brrrr while finding 10001 primes.
CrispyPin#1149: #600 is 35% difficulty
daimondweter#8284: Ok
CrispyPin#1149: its not exactly ion order of difficulty
daimondweter#8284: like supeerrr hard?
daimondweter#8284: Is problem 600 like "super hard"?
CrispyPin#1149: basically "solve later"
Red_3D#3062: oh
CrispyPin#1149: pinned problems
Red_3D#3062: what does the blue color mean?
CrispyPin#1149: https://projecteuler.net/problem=587 this is the hardest one ive done
Red_3D#3062: nice
Red_3D#3062: oh
CrispyPin#1149: click on progress
Red_3D#3062: where can I find that list?
daimondweter#8284: Lool, what's with 587?
CrispyPin#1149: 60
CrispyPin#1149: https://gyazo.com/4a18e22d6735285121cbcf36dcaacd98
CrispyPin#1149: ive not done them since february but yes
daimondweter#8284: Yes
CrispyPin#1149: you mean solve?
daimondweter#8284: Crispy, do you also make them?
Red_3D#3062: I would definitely recommend them.
CrispyPin#1149: do it
daimondweter#8284: Ok, pretty cool üëç  I will maybe start making them too
Red_3D#3062: am currently at the 3rd one, haven't had much time.
daimondweter#8284: How many did you do?
daimondweter#8284: But I don't think that means we should feel bad when we didn't.
Red_3D#3062: it does
Red_3D#3062: yes
daimondweter#8284: It feels great when you managed to do one, doesn't it?
Red_3D#3062: maybe a little too fast for me, because I did not have much of it in school. But it is manageable if you know how google works.
CrispyPin#1149: but the first 100 or so are not too hard
CrispyPin#1149: there is some really advanced stuff on euler
Red_3D#3062: yes
daimondweter#8284: Does it feel like it builds up pretty nice in difficulty?
Red_3D#3062: it really helps to grab your knowledge and skills and pulls them into plain sight.
daimondweter#8284: XD
daimondweter#8284: Yeah boi
Red_3D#3062: it is pretty awesome
Red_3D#3062: I did start
daimondweter#8284: Or did red mean that you could do it?
daimondweter#8284: Did red start?
daimondweter#8284: Xd, I wanted to do it too
Deleted User#0000: red suggested doing project euler lmao
Deleted User#0000: idk
daimondweter#8284: *trying* to work on it and wanting to get better at doing the stuff you want to is good, but feeling like crap if we don't is not good. (even the negative emotions can be good to some extent, but they are often too strong)
daimondweter#8284: And you know, you are probably going to feel bad again, and that's ok, but try to keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with what you do and that your feelings only mean that you care. I used to feel frustrated, because I wanted to make something I thought about for multiple weeks. I never got myself to do it and it felt bad, but actually, I think its sometimes actually important to just follow that feeling (I hate saying this myself, I'm used to telling myself that I'm being worthless and not doing what I am supposed to do). Its alright if you don't feel like doing it at the moment, but try to do stuff that only intimidates you a little and can keep you interested for a while, but seriously. Its ok not to feel like doing it at the moment even though there are so many people talking about procrastination as a bad thing, I think that in some cases its a healthy thing, but that it hurts us because we view it as something bad.
Deleted User#0000: xd
daimondweter#8284: Its something, even though its small. It still shows you are capable of creating OwO UwU things
Red_3D#3062: ^w^
Alright#2304: uwu
Red_3D#3062: UwU
Deleted User#0000: 
daimondweter#8284: XD
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: OwO UwU midi conversion thing
Deleted User#0000: i made a stupid
daimondweter#8284: Ha, those are the successful little moments that you should use to build faith in that you can make something again
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: ha
Deleted User#0000: take that, what daimond just said
Deleted User#0000: i mean at least C# let me make the TUNG music mod
daimondweter#8284: But eventually they feel like crap, because they do nothing
Alright#2304: shit, it's a bit past 6am
daimondweter#8284: You are not the only one feeling that way. A lot of people (including the ones that eventually managed to do something) want to actually create something cool that *they* made. There are so many people downloading multiple languages apps, art apps, programming apps, music apps (or just wanting to grab a piece of paper, but feeling overwhelmed by the idea and not doing it) while hoping that one of them is going to be different and actually making them do something.
Alright#2304: you shouldn't compare yourself with other people's progression repsi, that's a toxic mindset and tends to get things not done
Red_3D#3062: someone already made rockets, is SpaceX not satisfactory?
Deleted User#0000: i guess the one thing was the TUNG music mod
Deleted User#0000: and it's hard to get satisfaction from that
Deleted User#0000: usually it was just something someone's already done
Alright#2304: not all things have to be large to feel good of an accomplishment, progress is progress, and it can be slow or fast depending on the day
Alright#2304: it may help to think of things you did before that you feel you did well at, even if it's a small accomplishment
Deleted User#0000: but just "you're shit at everything" it is painful xd
Deleted User#0000: like i could live with "ok you're good at programming but shit at everything else"
Deleted User#0000: but now it's sort of bleeding over into programming too which has been my main thing
Deleted User#0000: which i internalized as "you cannot be solo game developer"
Deleted User#0000: I remember I used to be upset at myself because i'm not good at art / music / etc. or whatever
Alright#2304: then it's more like.. discipline, but that depends if you really want to discipline yourself in things that may not be interesting or passionate
Alright#2304: unless you have a somewhat similar mindset like me trying to find the easy solutions in difficult problems
Alright#2304: and like i said before, i dont think you found things you did before to be interesting or challenging
Red_3D#3062: (me neither)
daimondweter#8284: (me neither)
Alright#2304: (i dont think its garbage)
Deleted User#0000: is the feeling unskilled thing
Deleted User#0000: the most debilitating feeling in that entire garbage paragraph thing
Deleted User#0000: I think for me
daimondweter#8284: I mean, I used to keep writing vertically too lol
Deleted User#0000: i guess if i haven't noticed then it's not really conscious lmao
Alright#2304: no idea why
Deleted User#0000: so idk
Alright#2304: i also write somewhat vertically but it used to be super bad back then
Deleted User#0000: i haven't taken notice of that
daimondweter#8284: I mean, did it feel like it "plops" into your mind or as if it came consciously?
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: i still do
Red_3D#3062: this
Red_3D#3062: like
Red_3D#3062: kinda
Red_3D#3062: you used to write vertically
Alright#2304: lmao
Alright#2304: and it's 6am
Alright#2304: well at least for the channel
Alright#2304: i think this is gettin way offtopic anyways
Deleted User#0000: ?
daimondweter#8284: Repsi, does it come the same way as the spam-messages used to come in rows after each other?
Deleted User#0000: only when i think a joke i made was particularly bad lol
Deleted User#0000: i don't try to force it *every* time
Alright#2304: instead of trying to force it every time
Alright#2304: oh, well, maybe find moments when its actually funny to say
Deleted User#0000: idk if i wanna break it though
Alright#2304: that took me a while to break it though, im sure you can do the same xD
Alright#2304: but it didnt occur to me until he asked me to stop
Alright#2304: he didn't appreciate it, and i realized it got old
Alright#2304: because i thought it was funny to me
Deleted User#0000: i do it because apparently (according to you) people think it's funny
Alright#2304: i used to annoy nik all the time spamming him saying "you're gay"
Deleted User#0000: it is kind of a habit?
Alright#2304: habit
Alright#2304: yes
Deleted User#0000: i don't know xd
Alright#2304: habit?
Deleted User#0000: ?
Alright#2304: whats the word
Alright#2304: or is it like an outright uhhh
Alright#2304: well, you can stop
Deleted User#0000: it's just been more painful to say it recently
Alright#2304: i think it's funny
Deleted User#0000: idk
Deleted User#0000: i used to say "haha funy joek rapsi" as an actual joke lol
Alright#2304: haha funy joke rapsi
Deleted User#0000: and it might make people think i've been having these thoughts for a while when they're somewhat recent
Deleted User#0000: i was considering not putting the sentence about "haha funy joke rapsi" because that'd fuck up the meme
Alright#2304: anyways, 18 is pretty young and there's still a lot of time to think about things or decide on what you want to do, it sounds like you haven't gotten there yet
Deleted User#0000: b space ruh
Alright#2304: what a change of worldview in a month
Alright#2304: i went to actually a good uni in 2016 before finding out my mom voted for trump and then spiraling into depression lmao
Deleted User#0000: sorry
Deleted User#0000: oh
Alright#2304: i was originally in training for a coffee job related but the pandemic put it on pause
Alright#2304: i'm in school now for comp sci, but it's only associates and online shit
Alright#2304: so most of the time i outright fail interviews and struggle with people
Alright#2304: i'm deaf IRL which severely limits myself with personal communication jobs, and am autistic (though HFA) which makes me even more socially incapable
Alright#2304: it's quite complicated, although I think i'm less fortunate
Deleted User#0000: what do you do
Deleted User#0000: then like
Deleted User#0000: what
Alright#2304: i'm 24 and i dont have a degree, a job, or something similar
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: bro i'm 18 there ain't time to "keep your interests open and learn new things"
Alright#2304: a lot of people tend to say doing nothing is bad, it can be actually productive somehow but i think a lot of people look it as the wrong way
Alright#2304: you keep your interests open and learn new things
Alright#2304: i think it's important that you keep trying new things regardless until it clicks you into the place
Alright#2304: i feel similar when trying to program shit like idle games or my bot
Alright#2304: anyways, repsi, i think it's more that the projects you set up might be overwhelming or too challenging or uninteresting, lots of variety reasons
Alright#2304: but it turned into 1st frame, so i just kept it that way until i found this cute pic and i wanted to change it but i kept forgetting
Deleted User#0000: rip
Alright#2304: because my nitro expired a while so it was actually a gif before
Deleted User#0000: yes
Alright#2304: yeah i said i was changing my pfp
Deleted User#0000: your custom status
Alright#2304: rofl
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: idk why but my brain thought it was a different Alright
Alright#2304: what
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: i just realized you're the panda-emic person
Deleted User#0000: oh shit
Alright#2304: > people have told me i have in the past so idk <[newline]> they suck, then, because i don't see this as manipulative or selfish
daimondweter#8284: This is what I find frustrating about people talking about attention, being a bad thing. <[newline]> There is nothing wrong with wanting people to notice what is going on so they can help you especially when you feel like you dont deserve it, because it feels fake but you want it.
Alright#2304: which I don't think is a necessarily bad thing
Alright#2304: I feel the same way, but also because I lose interest in things a lot as they tend to not be challenging, informative, or learning
Deleted User#0000: people have told me i have in the past so idk
Red_3D#3062: ok, first of all. If you really fell like that then you are **not **lying and manipulating anyone.
Alright#2304: you're super funny repsi, but i can see what you mean by not having a build up of projects/works to prove you did things
Alright#2304: honestly I joined the server because nik told me you spent 45 minutes talking about cashew nuts and I had to see what it was for myself
Deleted User#0000: thanks i guess
Red_3D#3062: I know how hard it is to express one self with such feelings.
Red_3D#3062: you don't have to be sorry.
Deleted User#0000: i'm sorry
Deleted User#0000: it's kind of all over the place
Red_3D#3062: hold on, this will take a while.
Deleted User#0000: 
Red_3D#3062: anyway, here is a hug. <[newline]> If you still want to talk about it I would be delighted to listen.
Alright#2304: I'm quite bad at charm apparently
Red_3D#3062: Well, we can always ask if something is not clear.
Red_3D#3062: Repsi, you are not bothering anyone.
Deleted User#0000: like even if i wanted to explain it i don't feel like i'd do a good job of it
Deleted User#0000: i feel incapable of expressing my feelings
Deleted User#0000: it's nothing anyway
Alright#2304: ok xd
Deleted User#0000: i don't wanna bother anyone with this
Alright#2304: sometimes you shouldn't always say what you really feel about depending on the situation, but in general you should have some kind of outlet to express privately or a way to deal with your feelings (bottling it is not a good idea as that leads to more repression of actual emotion)
Deleted User#0000: i feel like i'm not being obvious enough but i also feel like if i just outright say what i'm feeling then i'm probably just lying and being manipulative over stupid shit
Red_3D#3062: Understandable, have a nice day.
Deleted User#0000: no
Red_3D#3062: Haha
Red_3D#3062: And that makes it funny
Red_3D#3062: Not funny, but THICC
Deleted User#0000: FUCKIN FUUNny
Deleted User#0000: yeah that's funny right
Deleted User#0000: repost the same fuckin video 8 times in the same day
Deleted User#0000: yeah repsi
Deleted User#0000: aw man we went from serious to ***B E A N S***

Deleted User#0000: fuckin hilarious
Deleted User#0000: ha ha
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: Alright
Red_3D#3062: That is not what Alright meant.
Deleted User#0000: then i guess i'm not even a fuckin human then lol
Alright#2304: It's what makes human human
Alright#2304: Talking about your feelings is important
Red_3D#3062: Ok
Deleted User#0000: nah i'm good lol
Red_3D#3062: No, please talk about your feelings.
Deleted User#0000: either way i'd be lying so i might as well shut up
Deleted User#0000: but at the same time if i say what i want to say i'm worried i'd be lying just to manipulate people in this server
Deleted User#0000: i feel like i'm not being entirely truthful about my feelings
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: like i haven't already tried
Deleted User#0000: lel
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: Speaking of personalities, make a new one with tulpamancy! (Look I gotta figure out how to make good segways for youtube, this is the best thing I have to use, ok?)
Deleted User#0000: personalities are fluid
Deleted User#0000: ^

Deleted User#0000: i'm just bullshitting everything

Deleted User#0000: i don't fucking know
Deleted User#0000: i don't know
Deleted User#0000: 'not like' isn't the right wording
Deleted User#0000: don't know how i feel
Deleted User#0000: i don't want to be rude i just
Deleted User#0000: why even say goodbye if you're not even sure you like the people anymore
Red_3D#3062: I would at least say goodbye and not block everyone.
Red_3D#3062: No, that sounds like Nitro.
Jimmy#8080: Also that would be career suicide for me
Jimmy#8080: No, I like lots of the people I ever knew
Deleted User#0000: starting new as someone else
Deleted User#0000: you ever just consider blocking everyone you ever knew, closing your discord acct, and then just
Red_3D#3062: It is basically the opposite of never gonna give you up [gonna give you up, gonna let you down]
Deleted User#0000: it's gonna be the song in full unedited

DoctorVWA#1917: I don't see any problems with the acronyms... about ooi I just invented it, it probally don't even exists
Alright#2304: i know what abh is, im quite familiar with some portal
Red_3D#3062: ok, ima load a save
DoctorVWA#1917: or noclip
Red_3D#3062: I am just inside a invisible box
DoctorVWA#1917: load a save
Red_3D#3062: can someone tell me how to get back?
DoctorVWA#1917: it's accelerated because the game add backwards speed to the player thinking that it's going to fast, but since you're back hopping it adds to where you want to go
DoctorVWA#1917: abh = accelerated back hop
Alright#2304: like abh and pfb and whatever
Alright#2304: i never understood these weird ass acronyms anyways
DoctorVWA#1917: ~~out of intended (area)~~
Alright#2304: out of inbounds?
Alright#2304: what is ooi
Red_3D#3062: ooi go asjd9uahishgiudfhgidhjrt
Red_3D#3062: ok
DoctorVWA#1917: ~~it's ooi,~~ oob refer to the map bounds, the walls/floor are inside the map bounds
Red_3D#3062: inside the floor is not the intended play area
Red_3D#3062: oob = outside of intended play area
DoctorVWA#1917: you're just inside the wall
DoctorVWA#1917: oob = scary black void
Alright#2304: it is oob if you go out of bounds
Red_3D#3062: crap, I accidentally went oob but I can no longer get in.
DoctorVWA#1917: not really oob
Red_3D#3062: oob go sjgiojjuhvainurhgijdfhgfgh
DoctorVWA#1917: xd
Deleted User#0000: because the trigger for ||the zombies to break down the walls|| isn't actually ||getting the shotgun or lowering the dude||, it's ||once you load the shotgun||, so there's really ||no rush||
DoctorVWA#1917: let's move the conversation to <#631004929762525204>
Deleted User#0000: i accidentally made him dislike that part of the game a little
Deleted User#0000: bro i just ran
Deleted User#0000: then they spring back when you release insert lmao
DoctorVWA#1917: that's a good part for VR and I would probally not handle it good xd
Deleted User#0000: as in, send arms out as far as you like
Deleted User#0000: insert to do a bobby hug
Deleted User#0000: oh yeah!
Deleted User#0000: i was streaming it for jackson and i accidentally diminished his perception of that part of the game
Deleted User#0000: so not even that far into the game
Deleted User#0000: i'm right after the part where ||you get the shotgun||
Deleted User#0000: it's muscle memory
Deleted User#0000: i'm probably missing some important key just because like
Deleted User#0000: absolute beans conditions
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: but it's strange how the brain can adapt to stupid conditions
Deleted User#0000: not long
DoctorVWA#1917: wtf repsi, for how long have you played it? xd
Deleted User#0000: page up and page down to `gro` and `shronk` accordingly
Deleted User#0000: ctrl to crouch
Red_3D#3062: the end of that vid: 10/10
Deleted User#0000: apostrophe to hold left hand at a specific point in space (does not continue to grip so you have to use rightshift + ' for that)
Deleted User#0000: semicolon to ||make the gravity gloves fling||
Deleted User#0000: but first you must get the magazine in there manually
Deleted User#0000: numpad . to reload magazine into weapon
Deleted User#0000: numpad 0 to remove magazine from weapon
DoctorVWA#1917: imagine doing a bunch of macros to actually play the game properly
Deleted User#0000: uhh
Deleted User#0000: but then you have to grab it too and manually inject it i think lmao
Deleted User#0000: magic button that allows you to reach your left hand into ||your right gravity glove's pocket thingy||

Red_3D#3062: Here a super awesome photo of one of our light rail vehicles.
Nik#1011: I see
Red_3D#3062: Hmm, it seems like they are actually light rails, but the are focused on below ground usage.
Red_3D#3062: Interesting, our subway is a complete subway but there are also a few rails above ground.
Nik#1011: (to me)
Nik#1011: sounds normal
Red_3D#3062: And it can be broken for days, I know of some systems that have been broken for months now.
Red_3D#3062: I think that only some of it is violence, many other systems in our subway are broken as well.
Nik#1011: it's seen as the higher-class of the public transportation methods for sure
Nik#1011: we don't have a subway in this city but we have a light rail, which goes partially above and partially below ground. It's pretty well maintained
Nik#1011: yeah only like 5-10% of our bus stops have screens. only the busy ones
Red_3D#3062: That was a subway station. only larger bus stations have signes here. <[newline]>  <[newline]> Interesting though.
Nik#1011: I guess that's more violence and less just equipment being bad
Nik#1011: not all of them have screens with arrival info, but yea sometimes the bus card readers are broken or the bus stop "hut" has the windows broken or things like that
Nik#1011: <@284602593597194250> I live in Seattle and I've seen lots of broken bus stops as well

Jimmy#8080: The extent of our legal existence is that I own the trademark and we are a registered business in the province of Ontario
Jimmy#8080: Mouse Hat Games is not incorporated (yet)
Dragon Lord#6944: I was also kind of joking because I wasn't sure if they were not. If they were accompanied it's a great bit of irony, and if they aren't it's still valid. I suppose what I said could have technically been considered upon because it had more than one possible interpretation, but that's in a bit of a gray area as far as puns go..
Nik#1011: well I guess technically that doesn't clarify if it is a company or not...

cmoa#8392: i'd rather go to my local bakery
Red_3D#3062: Interesting, I'ma try that.
Jimmy#8080: You can get some if you go to your local supermarket and ask for "baguettes"
Nik#1011: I don't get it
cmoa#8392: and baguettes
Nik#1011: and sliced bread
Jimmy#8080: I'm also a big fan of agriculture, plumbing, and cooking our food
Nik#1011: well I guess it has killed people. No invention needed for that to change someone's life, just pureeeeee electricity
Nik#1011: electricity was a more abstract invention, it didn't change anyone's lives directly until we invented things that used electricity in useful ways
Red_3D#3062: Don't forget electricity and engines, those are pretty cool as well.
Nik#1011: math, computers, and vaccines are the most life changing inventions humans have figured out
Jimmy#8080: I love vaccines, some of the coolest technology humans have
Jimmy#8080: thanks mom

Red_3D#3062: but there is obviously some moral contradiction here.
Stefan#5422: data is data
Red_3D#3062: well, it is correct. but I don't like it.
gnog#2259: ^
Stefan#5422: I dont see anything wrong
Red_3D#3062: yes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: yes
Red_3D#3062: I don't like the way this is phrased.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: 
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <@!284602593597194250> try making a subroutine to access an array, and you'll probably figure out how stuff like that works in higher level languages as well
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: because on the ti84+ce you practically get free access to everything *except* for the flash memory (and some very specific other areas)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: though I highly doubt you can achieve the same on something like windows or linux
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: compared to a single one when writing into vRam yourself
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but the OScall for drawing a pixel takes like 40 cycles
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: like yeah you can use OScalls
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Personally I write ASM for the ti84+ce (ez80), it has a lot of memory-mapped things that are just so much easier to use in ASM
Red_3D#3062: I would take a look into asm to understand pointers better and then move back to c++ if I actually want to do stuff with then.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: not saying it's worth switching to ASM for, since if you want to do anything for modern-day computers that isn't writing a bootloader, a higher-level language is much easier
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I find high-level-language pointers to be very weird
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: compared to ASM
gnog#2259: why pointers in c are shit
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: that's cuz ASM is basically glorified machine code
Red_3D#3062: ok, that sounds simple enough
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you go value
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if you want to use the literal value
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you just do (value)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but if you want to use it as a pointer
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: because a pointer is just a value
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: in asm (on most platforms) every value is already a pointer
Red_3D#3062: ima look into asm then
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: yes
Red_3D#3062: so pointers in asm are more fun than in c,c++?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: compared to assembly
Red_3D#3062: ok
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I'd say c is high-level already
Red_3D#3062: at what point is is high level? (is c++ high level)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if you use high level shit, they're ugly AF
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if you use ASM, pointers are super fun
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: (5) = 100
Red_3D#3062: I still hate them
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or rather
Red_3D#3062: ok
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: therefor, 5 = 100
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: address 5 has the value of 100
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: like say
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: technically
Red_3D#3062: wth, now I hate pointers even more.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: this is how pointers work
Red_3D#3062: assume: <[newline]> 5=100 <[newline]>  <[newline]> 5=100 <[newline]>  <[newline]> therefore: <[newline]> 5=100 <[newline]>  <[newline]> yes, I know how math works.

FalsePattern#7777: installers store the directories they need to delete when uninstalling. It's usually assumed that whoever made an installer for their program also specifies the directory the uninstaller needs to remove. <[newline]> No specified directory + badly written uninstaller = target directory assumed as "/", which is the root directory of the partition the uninstaller runs in on windows, or the root directory of literally everything on the pc on linux. <[newline]>  <[newline]> TL;DR: unspecified uninstall directory + crappy uninstaller = rapid storage cleanup

Deleted User#0000: <@!264431281251680264>
Deleted User#0000: everything else seems fine afaik
Deleted User#0000: OR is also wrong because the lamp isn't what the output is going to be (same fix as the XOR)
Deleted User#0000: but even then, i'm pretty sure that redstone block and the lamp would power the sides of the original inversion comparators and break it
Deleted User#0000: top left seems wrong too because i think they meant to put a comparator in subtract mode at the top (combine NOT with AND)
Deleted User#0000: (i don't think that redstone dust will power the lamp like that, and both outputs of comparators must be OR'd in order to have 1 proper output)
Deleted User#0000: replace the lamp with a regular block and put the lamp after the redstone dust
Deleted User#0000: top right is wrong

Stefan#5422: I already had
Stefan#5422: ok
Saltypretzel#0321: No watch it. It‚Äôs strangely stimulating in a strange way
Stefan#5422: I think you need a hug
Saltypretzel#0321: It feels that everything has been forgotten
Saltypretzel#0321: And it is also a bit saddening also
Saltypretzel#0321: It‚Äôs the feeling I would feel if I were to be left behind or something
Saltypretzel#0321: It‚Äôs this strange feeling
Saltypretzel#0321: It just makes me feel lonely and even nostalgic
daimondweter#8284: But without the glitches it might have made me feel almost the same
daimondweter#8284: The music also really helps to push me in the right direction for that feeling. <[newline]> I guess the glitches in the sound make it feel pushed a little further towards the loneliness side.
daimondweter#8284: Not seriously magical, but it might have felt special
daimondweter#8284: As if you are seeing what is left of a once rich-feeling magical place full of things that are happening
daimondweter#8284: Lol, adventure time, but everyone is gone
daimondweter#8284: Like, getting in a place with childhood stuff + the right music combined with an empty open world.
daimondweter#8284: I mean undertale without others

Deleted User#0000: and while it is too busy focusing on that i fucking murder the bitch
Deleted User#0000: i grab the flyswatter with one hand and carefully move the mouse with my other hand, making it focus on the cursor underneath it
Deleted User#0000: fly lands on computer screen
Deleted User#0000: ha i'm a genius
Saltypretzel#0321: Well the brain works differently for everyone, so we can‚Äôt define the memory of the brain, unless we take the brain apart. The resulting memory of taking the brain apart is zero because the person would be dead
Deleted User#0000: and usually what messes me up are words with similar prefixes or root words to ones i've seen before
Deleted User#0000: so it's hard to know how much data i'm actually storing
Deleted User#0000: however i did get that far...
Deleted User#0000: the brain cuts corners
Deleted User#0000: no
Deleted User#0000: does that mean i'm storing each word i've seen before?
Deleted User#0000: but i can go through like 130 stages of the verbal memory test
Deleted User#0000: well yeah
Saltypretzel#0321: I‚Äôm not a doctor
Saltypretzel#0321: Idk*
Saltypretzel#0321: But old
Saltypretzel#0321: Yeah, but you could argue that the short term memory of the brain is like 7 digits
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: and now you are back to stupid questions
Deleted User#0000: which means you'd need to know how many bits the brain runs on
Deleted User#0000: so you'd need to know the bit width of each neuron's electronic response
Deleted User#0000: because afaik neurons aren't binary
Deleted User#0000: but it's like `hm does it though`
Deleted User#0000: i mean to some degree that makes sense
Saltypretzel#0321: I asked the question ‚Äúhow many bytes of memory are in the human brain‚Äù so don‚Äôt feel bad
Deleted User#0000: these questions are nonsensical
Deleted User#0000: "what is the eye's resolution"
Deleted User#0000: and
Deleted User#0000: "i wonder how many bits the human brain computer works on"

Deleted User#0000: define "basicly" everyone
RyanT#1426: 16 but cpus were first made in 1978. 17 years later in 1995, 32 bit processors and OSes exist and basicly everyone stoped using 8 bit CPUS on Computers
Deleted User#0000: also backwards compatibility in general
Saltypretzel#0321: Also embedded machines
Deleted User#0000: who would've guessed
Deleted User#0000: it's almost like slow-to-adapt businesses exist because it's too expensive to upgrade when 32 bit perfectly fits your needs

Buzz#6223: for 16
Buzz#6223: not for female
Buzz#6223: im 0xF
Saltypretzel#0321: So non binary genders are just hexadecimal

Saltypretzel#0321: Still binary
Saltypretzel#0321: 1 bit genders: masculine, feminine. 2 bit genders: masculine other other feminine. 4 bit genders: masculine other other other other other other other other other other other other other other feminine.
Deleted User#0000: therefore you should approve of this idea and if you don't you are wrong
Deleted User#0000: we only have 3 arbitrary guidelines / axes
Deleted User#0000: therefore there is no reason to create a million genders

DoctorVWA#1917: I have a good reason this time, it's not just me being dumb, "sounds" isn't really used in portuguese, we use "parece" for "looks" and "sounds", closest to "sounds" would be "soa", but it is more of a poetic approuch than what is really used

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: Masturbated in the shower this morning. Vigorous stroking triggered an asthma attack. Asthma attack prompted me to exit the shower. Exiting the shower ended with me slipping and falling on my face. Called my roommate for help. Roommate found me naked on the floor, struggling to breathe. Cue roommate retrieving my inhaler. Inhaler failed to do the job after multiple attempts. Condition worsened. Ambulance was called. Roommate awkwardly helped me into my clothes. Paramedics showed up and put me on a nebuliser. Nebuliser helped me breathe, but little did I know the worst was yet to come. Paramedics said I had a fever and transported me to hospital. Hospital flagged me as a potential Covid case. Got placed in quarantine by nurses dressed up for Chernobyl. Got treated for my fever and tested for the virus. Speaking of the test, never again do I want those long ass swabs shoved down my throat again - it was so damn deep it practically touched my brain. Doctor conducted a thorough checkup. I winced when said doctor pressed on my stomach. Doctor narrowed her eyes and asked what the colour of my poop was. I said "kinda dark but, you know, not outer space dark". Doctor said "hm" before proceeding to spread my ass cheeks and jam her lubricated finger into my anus. For the record, that finger was thick as fuck and it happened to be the first time ever something penetrated me down there. Got discharged with a laundry list of prescribed medications and advised to self isolate until I recieve my test results. As of today, the thought of fapping has become nothing more than a source of nightmare fuel, and the feeling of being finger fucked in the b-hole is yet to disappear. TL:DR Fapping triggered my body to self destruct. Now I might be positive for the virus while having a phantom finger stirring the inside of my asshole, as well as World War 2 level flashbacks every time l wanna bust a nut.

PseudoGoose#2841: yeah the big problem with making it a "percentage" is that it's constantly changing, you'd have to constantly track how much value is in the world (that's another interesting question - how big is the scope of this "percentage"??). Whereas with fixed quantities of money that have changing value, you can track how much you have by how much you spend/receive

Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: well no because that percentage will change over time
daimondweter#8284: I mean wouldnt it be easier for people to understand what it means that they have a certain amount of money if money would be in the form of the percentage of the total amount?
Deleted User#0000: a percentage of the money supply*
daimondweter#8284: Money might be fake as in that it fools people that its an absolute value, but its actually more of a combination of things including a percentage of a lot of money??? (This is... this)

Deleted User#0000: idk it just seems like a shady thing to say lmao
Deleted User#0000: well yes but this isn't saying "this person is a pedophile and we are doing nothing about it", they state a specific example "running a country" and try to make your brain connect inability to run a country with pedophilism
Jimmy#8080: Ok personally I like Justin Trudeau, and I think his leadership of Canada has been high quality. But if it was revealed he rapes kids, I would want him removed from office immediately (and sent to jail) despite his quality leadership outside of the raping
Deleted User#0000: i seriously doubt that has much of an impact on their ability to run a country apart from legislation related to children
Deleted User#0000: also what the fuck is "your country is run by a bunch of pedophiles" supposed to mean anyway
Deleted User#0000: clearly someone has not watched rick and morty, -10 iq confirmed
Deleted User#0000: well yeah jimmy but uh have you ever *really* considered about how your money is fake, your food and water are being poisoned, all these wars are based on lies, your country is run by a bunch of pedophiles and you're too distracted by this bullshit meme to do anything about it?
FacePox#2708: I found that meme on the floor

Jimmy#8080: > Your money is fake <[newline]> No it's not?? Money is a social construct, but social constructs are very very real <[newline]> > your food and water are being poisoned <[newline]> I assume this is referring to microplastics and pesticides? Not really a deliberate effort by "the elite" to poison the populace, as the meme author implies <[newline]> > all these wars are based on lies <[newline]> Eeeeeeh. I am anti-war, but I don't think that's accurate <[newline]> > Your country is run by a bunch of pedophiles <[newline]> Eeeeeeh <[newline]> > You're all too distracted by bullshit to do anything about it <[newline]> Repsi has already pointed out why this statement is stupid
Deleted User#0000: this is also valid
Deleted User#0000: inb4 jimmy just drops a "repsi, it's a meme"
Deleted User#0000: you can't stop the humans without yourself being human
Deleted User#0000: of course first you'd probably need to separate yourself from the mother country, which means creating your own sustainable sources of food and water, and a currency to buy said goods
Deleted User#0000: perhaps a civil *war*?
Deleted User#0000: how would you suggest stopping the "country run by pedophiles" thing?
Deleted User#0000: distracted by bullshit i.e. twitter/reddit/youtube politics
Deleted User#0000: distracted by bullshit i.e. memery

Deleted User#0000: that doesn't mean you forgot how to use your right hand as your dominant hand
Deleted User#0000: just like how doing things lefthanded for a while teaches your brain how to use your left hand as your dominant hand
Deleted User#0000: if you take the glasses off and things feel weird for a long duration of time: the neurons have overwritten themselves, otherwise you've just learned a new skill
Deleted User#0000: it depends
Deleted User#0000: you don't see the image flipped, you just know how to parse everything you see
Deleted User#0000: you just allocate other neurons to flipping it for you
Deleted User#0000: yeah i doubt the image really "flips"
Dragon Lord#6944: sounds like the infinite improbability drive to me
DjSapsan#4530: <@!565587902570954782> question is not about flip but about mechanism. Neurons could not rewire/recconect in different way on the fly. It is obviously done in a software
daimondweter#8284: Lol, I dont know what is going on, but all I heard is that people that wear the glasses for a few days have their whole vision flip.
DjSapsan#4530: <@565587902570954782> do you mean that neurons can rewire themselves in a few days? i dont thinks its possible

Deleted User#0000: and it's all a hoax
Deleted User#0000: what if the axes *aren't* inverted
daimondweter#8284: Oh, that would explain a lot xd. <[newline]> I thought they always ment that our brains flip it "on purpose" to fix it and that made me wonder why that would even be needed.
Stenodyon#8192: I'm pretty sure it's not actually flipping it back and the visual processing is simply wired with the axes inverted
daimondweter#8284: I heard about that, I thought that their brain flipped it back for them? <[newline]> Im not sure. <[newline]> They say that the lens in our eyes flip it, because thats how those +lenses work or something xd, but that our brain flips it back. <[newline]> But thats why I wonder if our brain would even need to flip it back, I dont see the what advantages there are unless the rest of our brain would be already used to the other way
DjSapsan#4530: There was an experiments with glasses that turns image upside down and humans after a while get used to it
DjSapsan#4530: I dont think that brain neees to flip the image upside down. What we see is just **usual** way of seeing. When incoming image is in fact flipped then for us it is unusual
daimondweter#8284: Again, way too long
daimondweter#8284: (I do wonder though whether our sense of location of body parts is *actually" giving a location in the form of a feeling or whether its something that was created flexiblytasticalatuslike so that a flipped vision can make it that someone feels bodyparts on other places. I mean like, we would probably get used to the feelings in our body parts a different way and it makes it like what we would usually be down somewhere, more like up, because we got used to the feeling that way. <[newline]> Idkidkidkidk (Ha, it says kid when you repeat idk) <[newline]> I just wonder in what way they found out about it.
daimondweter#8284: Like, our brain could have also changed to not having the image flipped for us, right? <[newline]> Or is it harder, maybe something with keeping things linear or similar to other sensory information, but like what. <[newline]> If what we see would be flipped since our child birth (and there isnt anything in our brains, because of genetics that would be like, vjsbebsbb thats weird) <[newline]> We would get used to it and think thats what its like to have things up and things down normally. <[newline]> (How did they actually find out our brain turns it back? Something the measured from the brain? I mean like, if someones whole vision would still be  "upside down" then that person would also understand that the lens flips it, but that the brain probably flips it back, because that person doesnt think that the new places where it lands on the eyes are the places he sees it. <[newline]> Like: light falls up, but you are like, I see it down, so it must be flipped by my brain,  <[newline]> but also: light falls down, but you are like, I see up, so it must be flipped by my brain. <[newline]> This is the same situation, but for people with it flipped and without it and it has the same result (even though someone with it flipped (in case that the first one wasnt flipped) wouldnt call it down, and up like that, but what was learned (actually depends on how the person got it) which is up, and down, the same as situation one, but my point is that the thoughts during the experience may be the same.) <[newline]> Even things like moving your finger onto the lower part of your eye and seeing it can be flipped and it would be normal, because you are used to that being down (while you see it up) and the finger still comes from the location you always thought the body was so it makes sense.
daimondweter#8284: I sometimes find it weird
Deleted User#0000: but honestly unexplainable concepts are cooler
Deleted User#0000: people are like "noncomputable numbers are cool"
Deleted User#0000: that's so weird that i can just see everything upside down compared to everyone else's perception

Buzz#6223: you f o o l
Buzz#6223: a human construct

Deleted User#0000: idk maybe i'm the dumb one but why is medium plural there
Deleted User#0000: "facebook, a social **media** site"
Deleted User#0000: not because of all the üõ≥Ô∏è associated with it but because i feel like it's used incorrectly
Deleted User#0000: i hate the word social media

DoctorVWA#1917: if it was supposed to be animated, my computer just can't handle it

Dunda#2719: Women voting rights? Simp.
FacePox#2708: But sometime I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs used with sexist undertones
FacePox#2708: It‚Äôs useful to describe certain people
Jimmy#8080: I hate the word "simp" but I'm going to start using it ironically when anybody advocates for gender equality
Jimmy#8080: Hahahaha
FacePox#2708: 
Deleted User#0000: i'm sad it doesn't include that phrase though
Deleted User#0000: this is coincidental because before i went to bed i messaged someone and said "look who's come crawling back" without any context because it sounded funny at the time

Nik#1011: pretty similar words actually, don't blame you for swapping em
Deleted User#0000: what's the difference between an STD and an STI
DoctorVWA#1917: thanks
Nik#1011: you probably mean "reminds" not "remembers"
DoctorVWA#1917: cool random fact: OST reminds me of DST, which stands for Doen√ßa Sexualmente Transmissivel, what is literally yours STD, so when we talk about Don't Starve Togheter and don't want to write the whole name we need to use DST, and the conversation can get weird

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Like the entire existence of trump
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Fake news, maybe
Deleted User#0000: but then they'll forget after the next phone releases
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: It's not news to them

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Indeed

Deleted User#0000: here TBS
DoctorVWA#1917: ye, that will not help xd
Nik#1011: but then someone will post it without the spoiler right after
Deleted User#0000: i don't think i'd take those chances
DoctorVWA#1917: if you send it between spoiler tag probally the notification will not kill anyone, because spoiler notifications are literally <spoiler>
Nik#1011: Sindhi characters, apparently.
Deleted User#0000: ~~i'm pretty sure it's safe~~
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: How about you send a picture
Deleted User#0000: i googled it and i got no results
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Ah okay that makes sense
Deleted User#0000: it is a ~~backwards language~~ right to left language too
Deleted User#0000: ^
Nik#1011: it's a large string of many compounding characters. I don't know how to put a space in it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ...only for some asshat to directly post it without the space after
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <@119734190571913216> you could send it with a space in the middle
Deleted User#0000: for good
Deleted User#0000: i mean
Deleted User#0000: i will use these powers for evil
DoctorVWA#1917: ~~why does anyone uses ios?~~
Deleted User#0000: if so, go ahead and DM me it i'm like 8 versions out of date
Nik#1011: it's ok you can just reboot your phone to fix
Deleted User#0000: does it only crash later ios versions?
Deleted User#0000: uhh
Nik#1011: lmao
Nik#1011: do you want me to crash your phone repsi?
Deleted User#0000: there's your direct answer
Deleted User#0000: (because i like seeing the shitposts this community generates)
Nik#1011: I'd send it here but actually I don't want to in case anyone here has notifications turned on for this channel lol (why would anyone do that)
DoctorVWA#1917: wow @everyonetext
Nik#1011: apparently there's a new string of text that can crash iPhones when that text appears in a notification
Deleted User#0000: `the council of cuckoldry`
Deleted User#0000: from now on i'm strictly referring to that idea as
Deleted User#0000: rather than being a retard and saying "the world leaders"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: The stuff's designed to kill, literally
Deleted User#0000: the council of cuckoldry like to call it "population control"
Deleted User#0000: nah sounds great to me
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Injecting toxic stuff into your body doesn't sound all that great
Deleted User#0000: which is probably worse since it's going *directly* into the bloodstream rather than having to be somewhat filtered first
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: A few years ago there was Obama and the world was fine
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: How did this happen
Deleted User#0000: apparently it was actually *injections* not just inhaling it
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Why in the fuck
Deleted User#0000: that's some good shit

daimondweter#8284: Hmm
daimondweter#8284: Take this punch
daimondweter#8284: OOPS YOU WROTE COSOLE.LOG INSTEAD OF CONSOLE.LOG!!
daimondweter#8284: > cause sometimes if i'm doing something i just sing a short little tune over and over (in my head) on how to continue doing it <[newline]> <@456226577798135808> Interesting. <[newline]> I dont know what it is with programming, but I usually have a project in mind and just know where to start and what to do next, without thinking very detailed about every single step
daimondweter#8284: And I also wonder whether you mean that its like talking to you or you are talking
daimondweter#8284: I can think in both ways, but Im not sure which one you mean ;-;
daimondweter#8284: Its a simulated experience of hearing
daimondweter#8284: Outside
daimondweter#8284: Then its not actually there
daimondweter#8284: But if its in your head head
daimondweter#8284: And they recognize it in certain ways that its as if they say things normally
daimondweter#8284: That you dont hear on the outside
daimondweter#8284: Because sometimes people think by making small sounds inside their head
daimondweter#8284: > *hear* hear or just hear? <[newline]> <@456226577798135808> head hear or ears hear
daimondweter#8284: Lol, I mean it like
daimondweter#8284: Thinking can make you feel like its in your head but it sometimes isnt
Saltypretzel#0321: I hear it so much, that it confuses me if I am talking actually sometimes
daimondweter#8284: Yes, but it depends on whether you do it by breathing and learning to recognize it in certain ways, which makes it like its an actual sound, or that its actually in your head
Saltypretzel#0321: It‚Äôs strange
Saltypretzel#0321: I actually hear a voice
Deleted User#0000: *hear* hear or just hear?
Saltypretzel#0321: Like I hear math problems because I read them out in my mind
Saltypretzel#0321: And I also hear what I am thinking
Saltypretzel#0321: Well I hear what I‚Äôm reading
daimondweter#8284: That stuff
daimondweter#8284: It feels like someone else talks to me or I talk?
daimondweter#8284: Simulate sounds? Or litteral sounds in ones head
daimondweter#8284: Yes, but there are multiple ways ;-;
Saltypretzel#0321: Like do you hear yourself talking to yourself in your head <@565587902570954782>
Saltypretzel#0321: I‚Äôll switch touch and sight
Deleted User#0000: cause sometimes if i'm doing something i just sing a short little tune over and over (in my head) on how to continue doing it
daimondweter#8284: > I always have an internal monologue <[newline]> <@371851806067654657> which one do you mean?
Saltypretzel#0321: Like I speak out what I‚Äôm imagining in my head kind of
Deleted User#0000: i might wanna move sound up on my list tbh
Saltypretzel#0321: But my internal monologue guides me through it sometimes
daimondweter#8284: Lol
daimondweter#8284: Feels cool
daimondweter#8284: Hmmm
Saltypretzel#0321: I also calculate stuff like that too
daimondweter#8284: Or I just play the story in my head
Saltypretzel#0321: For art only
Saltypretzel#0321: I do that too
daimondweter#8284: I create images in my head and use it to make it easier to keep track of certain patterns and shapes
Saltypretzel#0321: How so
Saltypretzel#0321: Imagine?
daimondweter#8284: I imagine stuff all the time. <[newline]> When I program, do mathematics, walk somewhere, read...
Saltypretzel#0321: Like I hear what I‚Äôm writing out right now
Saltypretzel#0321: I hear it when I‚Äôm doing work
Deleted User#0000: it's usually just there to mock me lmao
Deleted User#0000: like when programming
Deleted User#0000: i mainly hear it when i'm working on something and i do it wrong or w/e
Saltypretzel#0321: I always have an internal monologue
Deleted User#0000: sometimes
Deleted User#0000: when i'm meditating i often have problems with creating "recursive thoughts"
Saltypretzel#0321: Do you people have an internal monologues
daimondweter#8284: Was that understandable?
daimondweter#8284: Ehm
daimondweter#8284: I sometimes wonder whether Im even capable of imagining and then notice that Im imagining how Im doing something else and have problems imagining
daimondweter#8284: Head*
Saltypretzel#0321: Well that came out weird
Saltypretzel#0321: I don‚Äôt really taste, but I smell
Saltypretzel#0321: Yeah for me it is  <[newline]> Smell <[newline]> Hearing <[newline]> Touch <[newline]> Sight <[newline]> Taste
daimondweter#8284: To sense in your hewd
daimondweter#8284: It sounds weird
daimondweter#8284: Yes I believe you, lol I imagine all the time. <[newline]> I mean it more like "in your head" hmmm.
Deleted User#0000: the poster was brain generated, room was brain generated
Deleted User#0000: all in my head
Deleted User#0000: i was putting up a poster in a room, during meditation
Deleted User#0000: no it was fully in my head
daimondweter#8284: "In your head"
daimondweter#8284: Well
Deleted User#0000: yeah
daimondweter#8284: In your head right?
Saltypretzel#0321: But I think my tasting is different, I smell better than taste
Deleted User#0000: and i remember accidentally poking myself with one of the thumbtacks and it felt real
daimondweter#8284: Yay
Deleted User#0000: putting up a brain-generated LW poster
Saltypretzel#0321: Taste
Deleted User#0000: like i was doing something the other day in my brain
Saltypretzel#0321: When I see food that I don‚Äôt know what it tastes like, I imagine the trader
daimondweter#8284: Saltypretzel can you make a list with best to worst?
Saltypretzel#0321: I also imagine tastes
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: it's just that i never think to record the feeling of imagining it
daimondweter#8284: Oh
daimondweter#8284: When I imagine a taste I litterly feel it
Deleted User#0000: it's down there not because i have bad sense in it
Saltypretzel#0321: Oh I taste and hear
Deleted User#0000: i mean it's probably higher on the list tbh
daimondweter#8284: But its one of my highest
daimondweter#8284: A lot of people have taste down
daimondweter#8284: Lol
daimondweter#8284: Interesssstingggg
Deleted User#0000: touch - best brain-simulated sense <[newline]> smell <[newline]> sight <[newline]> sound <[newline]> taste - worst brain-simulated sense
Saltypretzel#0321: Idk what ur talking about so
daimondweter#8284: Taste, sight, sound, touch, smell (emotions kind of)
Deleted User#0000: the standard 5 or wut

Deleted User#0000: aka the reason you should not eat something sweet before eating
Deleted User#0000: is taste adaptation

daimondweter#8284: > arguably the most important muscle group in the human physiology <[newline]> <@456226577798135808> Do you mean it in a serious way, or as a joke? Lol
daimondweter#8284: I have never trained muscles this easily lol
daimondweter#8284: I once found it hard to control them but I tried to to make my little brother laugh, because of the weird expressions I made with my face, but the next day I felt my muscles and noticed that they were stronger and I could control them easily, so I did it again to see how far I could pull the skin on my neck down, next day: more muscle pain and stronger. Now a lot of time later I can say that its still strong and I sometimes used it in the time beteen now and then which caused it to get even stronger lol.
Deleted User#0000: arguably the most important muscle group in the human physiology
daimondweter#8284: I accidently trained my neck muscles a LOT

Deleted User#0000: i saw it i just decided not to comment on it xd
Deleted User#0000: oh
DoctorVWA#1917: why
Nik#1011: also with this much investigation of my keyboard, nobody noticed the double J and double F
Nik#1011: it's type C
Deleted User#0000: isn't mini usb the one apple owns or something
DoctorVWA#1917: type c maybe xd
Deleted User#0000: or whatever it's called lmao

Deleted User#0000: wat
DoctorVWA#1917: that costs fucking 120 BRL and I don't want to buy a new one
DoctorVWA#1917: no, the "cord" aka flat cable is the turn on button
Deleted User#0000: i'm assuming the cord in the back is a micro usb or something
DoctorVWA#1917: I hate it
Deleted User#0000: vwa
DoctorVWA#1917: and it's retarded
DoctorVWA#1917: yes

DoctorVWA#1917: <@!119734190571913216> how big is your hand in the keyboard?
Deleted User#0000: portuguese has that symbol?
Deleted User#0000: wait
DoctorVWA#1917: ask dell portuguese keyboard layout manufecturers
Deleted User#0000: and why is caps lock literally bigger than the shift keys wtf
Deleted User#0000: i don't like the inconsistent size of the shift keys
DoctorVWA#1917: I have no idea, it isn't glue, it just looks bad
Deleted User#0000: that's kinda what it looks like
Deleted User#0000: is it like a sticker was there?
DoctorVWA#1917: the good thing is that it isn't nasty, idk wtf is on it, I can't get it off
Nik#1011: <@456226577798135808> the double single-unit spacebar is the default configuration for this keyboard.
Deleted User#0000: that is a nasty mousepad
DoctorVWA#1917: my super keyboard
DoctorVWA#1917: yes
Deleted User#0000: left spacebar and right spacebar
Deleted User#0000: you should've been insane and made it two keys
Deleted User#0000: i don't like your spacebar
Nik#1011: but you decided it's a great time to show off your keyboard and interupt the conversation

Deleted User#0000: even though it was only 10 years back
Deleted User#0000: 10 BC would be called "the 10s"
Deleted User#0000: i don't like that
Nik#1011: doc are you okay
Nik#1011: uuh
Deleted User#0000: what the fuck
DoctorVWA#1917: do you think people in the early 0s called -70 the "negatives seventies"?
Nik#1011: I've honestly never thought of that
Nik#1011: damn.
Deleted User#0000: do you think people in the early 1900s called 1870 the '70s
DoctorVWA#1917: I think my "c" key is dying, I always miss it
Nik#1011: the "@" symbol is RSE+,
DoctorVWA#1917: ~~so you have this keyboard, but you actually don't use it?~~
Nik#1011: that was my clipboard
Nik#1011: 
DoctorVWA#1917: you have it in your clipboard <@!119734190571913216>
DoctorVWA#1917: and it's grammatically correct

Deleted User#0000: crazies =/= human?
Nik#1011: <@!527553031613710368> nah. I have a regular keyboard for humans, and this keyboard is for crazies
DoctorVWA#1917: oh wait
Deleted User#0000: you can't type that properly because `you'd need hyphens`
Deleted User#0000: oh wait
DoctorVWA#1917: do you have a keyboard for letters and one for mathmatics and one other for physics?
Deleted User#0000: two-hundred eighty-four
Nik#1011: or twohundred eighty four
Deleted User#0000: you have to type
Nik#1011: and eight
Deleted User#0000: 284
Nik#1011: you can type three
Deleted User#0000: now instead of just typing
Nik#1011: nah it's easy

DoctorVWA#1917: it has two spinal coords? :O
Nik#1011: easy
Nik#1011: spinal cord
DoctorVWA#1917: if the processor is the brain, the south/north bridge are what?
Deleted User#0000: that's an even better example xd
Nik#1011: that's like asking a building if the windows are arms or legs
Deleted User#0000: they're both
Deleted User#0000: that's like asking a fish whether its fins are arms or legs
DoctorVWA#1917: important question: are the PCI the motherboard legs, or it are the arms? same for the ram socket
Deleted User#0000: that's good
Deleted User#0000: this isn't a ssoyoung video but with a motherboard
Nik#1011: idk why but ground15 has a lot of dead hardware
Deleted User#0000: ok good
Nik#1011: nah it was dead
DoctorVWA#1917: or legs
DoctorVWA#1917: he just took of one of his arms
Deleted User#0000: what if you wanted that socket
DoctorVWA#1917: it isn't completely dead
Deleted User#0000: i know but still xd
DoctorVWA#1917: you can still use the other sockets
Deleted User#0000: i guess it's seeing something of value get broken
Deleted User#0000: wtf is wrong with humans
Deleted User#0000: is it weird to feel emotion when a motherboard is destroyed
DoctorVWA#1917: no, that's wrong, you need to desolder the socket and bring it with the ram
Deleted User#0000: that poor creature
Nik#1011: <@456226577798135808> I like how you're trying to learn how to actually install ram from that horrible horrible video
Nik#1011: make sure you remove it properly too
Nik#1011: https://youtu.be/89-RPWWGWSk
Deleted User#0000: i don't know xd
Deleted User#0000: be rotating half of it that's still clamped down
Deleted User#0000: one side at a time seems wrong to me since you'd like
Deleted User#0000: maybe idk
DoctorVWA#1917: I don't think it's wrong, but each side at a time is easier I think xd
Deleted User#0000: is this wrong xd
Deleted User#0000: and then usually both sides go down at the same time
Deleted User#0000: i always direct a lot of force towards the center of the stick
Deleted User#0000: have i been doing it wrong this whole time
DoctorVWA#1917: oh, I always installed it upsidedown so
Deleted User#0000: one side then the other?

DoctorVWA#1917: I think ALU is the base of any computer xd
Saltypretzel#0321: unless those do any of the maths
Saltypretzel#0321: go play with mechanical computers
DoctorVWA#1917: with no math, obviously
DoctorVWA#1917: you can just play it in your mind
Saltypretzel#0321: if your computer adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, or compares. no
DoctorVWA#1917: who needs computers to play LW and build computers?
Nik#1011: TRAFFIC SUCKS! If no cars existed, traffic would be better for everyone for ever. BAN MATH!
Nik#1011: screw you guys I'm going to continue rioting against math
Saltypretzel#0321: ok fine mister
DoctorVWA#1917: if the matrix depends on math, our lifes do as well
Nik#1011: I meant human inventions that occurred due to understanding of math, not things in nature that can be explained with math
Saltypretzel#0321: well not really, out atoms would fall apart without math
DoctorVWA#1917: we are in the matrix
Nik#1011: I was just listing things that wouldn't exist without math. Life isn't one of those.
Saltypretzel#0321: there is no such thing
Nik#1011: um
Saltypretzel#0321: life doesn't exist

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: same i hope hes able to come back with them eventually
Nik#1011: probably best that he did tho. Wish he didn't have to do unreasonable actions to stop animals from dying
Nik#1011: well he didn't *have* to stop the unboxings
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: well he had to stop them because of that
Nik#1011: canceling the unboxings isn't even the solution to the problem either. The unboxings are fine, it's just the people sending him animals he cannot take care of
Nik#1011: people are stupid
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: in one of his first unboxings he got a small goldfish, named it randolph and took care of it and then people got out of control
Nik#1011: why are people sending him fish in the first place, that's cruel
Nik#1011: that sucks
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: he had to buy all the aquarium stuff while in quarantine lock down
Nik#1011: ok it's even worse if you're sending live animals to people who you ***know*** are untrained in handling them
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: lol
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: well hes not a stranger
Nik#1011: it's the fault of people sending live animals in the mail to strangers
Nik#1011: well it's not his fault
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: yeah this guy knows nothing about fish, people just think its funny to send to him for his unboxings, so he had to cancel the unboxings for now :(
Nik#1011: I think that's why gustavo might've died
Nik#1011: fun fact: don't put fish into different containers of water without letting both containers equalize in temperature first
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: i feel bad for the fish

brendansw1#4161: 
brendansw1#4161: If you measure the size of the left and right joycon they are not even close to the same width in the logo
brendansw1#4161: similar idea to the switch logo which is even more wrong

Red_3D#3062: sounds like fun
Deleted User#0000: wut
Deleted User#0000: Metagyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron
Deleted User#0000: wait is it literally just a dodecahedron but with two of the faces replaced by a triangle pentagon thing
Deleted User#0000: thanks 3 dimensional geometry
Deleted User#0000: or even  parabiaugmented dodecahedron, triaugmented dodecahedron, or what about pentakis dodecahedron
Deleted User#0000: metabiaugmented dodecahedron
Deleted User#0000: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabiaugmented_dodecahedron
Deleted User#0000: but  god said
Deleted User#0000: what if you wanted to go to heaven
Deleted User#0000: i'll probably have a few different default options for controls
Deleted User#0000: it's just a "look behind" feature
Deleted User#0000: maybe holding the mouse buttons flips your view 180 degrees *however* it doesn't flip you
Red_3D#3062: that is 3D but i like it
Deleted User#0000: i like that
Deleted User#0000: mouse + Q/E for roll
Deleted User#0000: and you just move with the mouse
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: what if it's a first person game
Deleted User#0000: i imagine just yaw/pitch would be harder probably
Deleted User#0000: yaw/pitch/roll controls are hard to master lol
Deleted User#0000: but that seems really limiting
Red_3D#3062: oh, it sounded like you could move in 3
Deleted User#0000: that's what i'm thinking lol
Deleted User#0000: you'd rotate around 2 axes instead of just 1?
Red_3D#3062: in my idea the player would move in 2D while the same "scaling" happens
Red_3D#3062: in super hexagon the player is only moving on one axis and the world is "scaling down".
Deleted User#0000: that's a good thing i think for these kinds of games though
Deleted User#0000: just envisioning the game in my head is hurting my brain
Red_3D#3062: my idea was the 2D field is moving by itself but giving control to the player is also an option.
Deleted User#0000: maybe JL+IK too just for *that person*
Deleted User#0000: i think that's a good selection of keys
Deleted User#0000: AD + WS / arrow keys / mouse buttons + scroll wheel?
Deleted User#0000: thanks for the idea lmao
Deleted User#0000: i actually like the second option more than what i was planning
Red_3D#3062: will the movement be 3D or is the player moving in 2D and scrolling through the third dimension?
Deleted User#0000: when you make a new unity project and it's like "hold on . . . . . ."
Deleted User#0000: polyhedron = "many faces"
Deleted User#0000: or 3d face in this case
Deleted User#0000: hedra is from greek meaning seat/base
Red_3D#3062: the shapes in the image are Dodecahedra
Jimmy#8080: also fun
Jimmy#8080: I did not know the word "polyhedron"
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: polyhedra is plural of polyhedron
Jimmy#8080: fun
Red_3D#3062: yes it is
Jimmy#8080: huh, yes it is!
Deleted User#0000: yes
Jimmy#8080: > polyhedra  <[newline]> that's a fun word, is it a *real* word?
Deleted User#0000: i guess i could color around the space you could go lol
Deleted User#0000: wait how would wireframe work
Deleted User#0000: maybe wireframe on some
Deleted User#0000: maybe transparent polyhedra on some levels
Deleted User#0000: then yes
Deleted User#0000: if the weird pentagons are places you can move the little cursor to in order to win
Deleted User#0000: i think
Deleted User#0000: yes
Red_3D#3062: the game
Deleted User#0000: ?
Red_3D#3062: like this?
Deleted User#0000: it does look good though lol
Deleted User#0000: this is not what i meant by 3D
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: well that's lame
Jimmy#8080: regardless of who makes or made it that's something I'd like to see
Deleted User#0000: googling time
Deleted User#0000: ...that's probably already been done before
Deleted User#0000: i am going to attempt to 3D-ify super hexagon
Deleted User#0000: i had an idea, you won't like it jimmy
Jimmy#8080: unity is a nice tool have fun with it
Deleted User#0000: i'm meaning to say "yes i am now opening unity"
Red_3D#3062: oh lol
Deleted User#0000: noo lol
Deleted User#0000: wha
Red_3D#3062: did you integrate it into the icon?
Red_3D#3062: is it always there?
Red_3D#3062: oh no

Jimmy#8080: much ~~worse~~ better
Deleted User#0000: 
Jimmy#8080: also this is not the same graph as the previous one
Jimmy#8080: could you do it a little less coherently? I can almost understand this version
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: aaaaah
Jimmy#8080: label the axes and the lines
Jimmy#8080: could you like
Jimmy#8080: I don't understand this graph?
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: this is the graph of the percentages of TOTAL messages from BEGINNING OF TIME btw
Red_3D#3062: ok
Deleted User#0000: you get me @ about 116% of jimmy's messages
Deleted User#0000: if you compare total messages from the beginning of time for both of us
Deleted User#0000: so it was the average percentage
Deleted User#0000: divided by total number of days
Deleted User#0000: sum of percentages (100 * repsi daily / jimmy daily)
Deleted User#0000: 115% was
Deleted User#0000: oh wait no
Deleted User#0000: why aren't those the same number those should be the same number
Deleted User#0000: wait
Deleted User#0000: (sum of messages) / (sum of messages)
Deleted User#0000: 115% was comparing
Deleted User#0000: total me / total jimmy
Deleted User#0000: 365.5 was comparing
Deleted User#0000: it's kinda hard to explain
Red_3D#3062: you said 365,5% in that time. and then 1.15:1. I thought you counted all messages. (for 1.15:1)
Deleted User#0000: but this was only counting the messages for which i was here
Red_3D#3062: wait
Deleted User#0000: yes
Red_3D#3062: Jimmy was here before you
Deleted User#0000: oh i guess there's some days where i only send a couple messages
Deleted User#0000: why does that sound inaccurate
Deleted User#0000: but for individual messages i send about 1.15 messages for every 1 message you send
Deleted User#0000: for -total- messages, i sent about 365.5% more than you in that time
Jimmy#8080: neato
Deleted User#0000: 17512 / 4791 = about 3.655
Deleted User#0000: alright that's
Deleted User#0000: not since the beginning of LW?
Deleted User#0000: oh, since i've joined?
Jimmy#8080: No, I want to see the average daily your messages : my messages. Take your total messages sent and divide it by my total messages since you've joined
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: why is it giving me undefined
Deleted User#0000: your messages / mine
Deleted User#0000: since that's the continuous one
Deleted User#0000: for you?
Jimmy#8080: what's the average ratio?
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: but yet your messages per day divided by mine is continuous because `i am always here`
Deleted User#0000: something interesting is that my messages per day divided by yours (to get the average ratio of messages i send to messages you send) has points where it's undefined because some days you have no messages
Deleted User#0000: maybe today it will be lmao
Deleted User#0000: i don't think it's the former
Jimmy#8080: probably both ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Deleted User#0000: i'm not sure if it's just your responses to me or just us both being more active when the server as a whole is more active
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: it looks random but if you look closer it follows a weird pattern where ~~everyone echoes after me~~
Deleted User#0000: that's probably just the basis of the random noise we see in the overall messages
Jimmy#8080: I bet if you graphed more users, they'd have spikes in the same places
Jimmy#8080: that's cool!
Deleted User#0000: have a spike in your messages too lol
Deleted User#0000: or most of them
Deleted User#0000: all the spikes

Deleted User#0000: wait i just realized
Jimmy#8080: Not sure exactly how to describe the feeling

Saltypretzel#0321: Calculus lmao
Deleted User#0000: if you want to *cheat*
Deleted User#0000: from a limited value xd
Deleted User#0000: it's a sum under the curve
Deleted User#0000: you're integrating...
Deleted User#0000: no
DoctorVWA#1917: it should be the same, when you tend to infinity it tends to zero
Deleted User#0000: we're integrating from ||-40 to inf||
Deleted User#0000: lol
Deleted User#0000: or whatever
Deleted User#0000: we're not integrating from -1000000 to 100000
Deleted User#0000: what?
DoctorVWA#1917: it's zero, the graph is quite similar to 1/x, simplyfing it's almost like this one, but with -49 in the integral, you have two assympthotes in the middle, but this tends to zero when you integrate them equaly by both sides
Deleted User#0000: it goes to infinity
Deleted User#0000: see look
gnog#2259: 
cmoa#8392: it's ||integral from -40 to inf of (49cos(x))/(-20x)dx|| right ?
Deleted User#0000: but it's outlawed by calculus xd
Deleted User#0000: i mean i guess there's a way to cheat
Deleted User#0000: cake is the variable you integrate by
Deleted User#0000: as doctorvwa said
Deleted User#0000: cake is the variable
DoctorVWA#1917: such as f(x)=bla cos(x)/blab bla
DoctorVWA#1917: cake is not defined, it's the variable

Deleted User#0000: the 8 genders xd
Deleted User#0000: true
RyanT#1426: Well theres 4 options in the thing above
Deleted User#0000: 000 - male <[newline]> 001 - female <[newline]> 010 - masculine NB <[newline]> 011 - feminine NB <[newline]> 100 - masculine other <[newline]> 101 - feminine other <[newline]> 110 - neutral NB <[newline]> 111 - neutral other
Deleted User#0000: i'd argue that male is 000, female 001, feminine nb 011, masculine nb 010, neutral nb 110, other-masculine 100, other-feminine 101, and other neutral 111
RyanT#1426: male is 00, female is 01, non binary is 10 and other is 11 so 00 + 01 + 10 + 11 = 110 which is 3 bits in a 2 bit system
Deleted User#0000: what's wrong with both

Deleted User#0000: toss in the same image and you might get different results
Deleted User#0000: and the rest is your skin color + some random number generation thrown in
Deleted User#0000: from examining the google play reviews, many people seem to agree it's mostly your location data
Deleted User#0000: so you may be accidentally exposing your location by sharing data produced by this app
Deleted User#0000: all i know is, a friend who lives in kuwait showed me 4 completely different faces in the app and 3 had kuwait for #1, and one had kuwait as #2
gnog#2259: let me check, IIRC my friend was not russian in this app

Nik#1011: and they never fix anything
Deleted User#0000: and it took them back apart
Nik#1011: their video player has had bugs since eternity
Deleted User#0000: and then searched
Deleted User#0000: like i put two nsfw words together into one long word
Nik#1011: lmao
Deleted User#0000: it also randomly inserts spaces if it deems it misspelled
Nik#1011: boobs
Nik#1011: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: hmm
Deleted User#0000: we need to find an actual term that they haven't used yet that already exists
Nik#1011: 
Deleted User#0000: very related
Nik#1011: hah cool. except it doesn't seem to be searching for ujk
Deleted User#0000: not
Deleted User#0000: but the results are
Deleted User#0000: it lets you search it and it says "did you mean u jk?"
Deleted User#0000: if you (iu??) put backslashes before each letter
Nik#1011: oh also whenever you search for anything relatively lewd on google, you get many search results from their site. Not useful results, nooooo. No you just get results that will search their site for the same thing. And as i've already noted, their search is atrocious
Deleted User#0000: it just ignores it if it's *too* misspelled
Deleted User#0000: no!
Nik#1011: backslashes?? repsi you're overestimating them again
Nik#1011: good theory, let me know if you figure it out
Deleted User#0000: not even backslashes
Nik#1011: huh
Deleted User#0000: maybe it'll correct to ujk
Deleted User#0000: what if i like misspell it more
Nik#1011: exactly
Deleted User#0000: i can't even put it in quotes
Deleted User#0000: why does it forcefully autocorrect
Nik#1011: and in fact they were so confident that it is impossible to search for UJK
Nik#1011: but apparently they think I meant UK
Nik#1011: I just hit my keyboard with my hand and UJK came out
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: meanwhile i'm over here
Deleted User#0000: ok gifs

Deleted User#0000: gifs.
Deleted User#0000: gifs?

Nik#1011: oh it also auto corrects you in a way that is impossible to do controlled searches
Deleted User#0000: or all
Deleted User#0000: professional
Deleted User#0000: homemade
Deleted User#0000: you can also choose whether you prefer

Deleted User#0000: 1 filter
Deleted User#0000: a filter
Deleted User#0000: i think they have filter
Deleted User#0000: so yes
Deleted User#0000: they have a "duration (minutes)" search filter
Nik#1011: when you search for anything with the + character, it gets converted to a space
Deleted User#0000: i mean
Nik#1011: you underestimate their ignorance
Nik#1011: ha.
Nik#1011: you think that site has search filters?!
Deleted User#0000: -X ‚úÖ
Deleted User#0000: no X ‚ùå
Deleted User#0000: this is why the - modifier exists
Nik#1011: I think the other site that starts with X and ends with a mammal is a decent place, website-programming-wise
Deleted User#0000: the same thing applies to google in some cases
Nik#1011: yeah the site is horrible
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: the site‚Äôs just bad. the others are still worse though
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i agree
Nik#1011: you search for "no X" and you only get results with "X" in the title. Then you search for a variant of X, and you only get results with "no X" in the title
Deleted User#0000: copyright is a social construct
Nik#1011: they seem to give no fucks about stolen content
Nik#1011: ehh no, everything on that site is questionably legal
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: and you get very questionable illegal results
Deleted User#0000: is this like when you can search a specific term on bing
Deleted User#0000: smh
Nik#1011: <#579404057148653568>
Deleted User#0000: it's just a search engine
Deleted User#0000: rule 3?
Nik#1011: idk how far I'm passing into rule 3 territory though so this is where I'll stop
Nik#1011: I know 2 examples that yield literally the opposite of what you searched for.
Nik#1011: just seems to give you the most popular results that contain any of the words you searched
Nik#1011: horrible search. the worst I've seen on any major site.

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: so to create more money, you create more debt
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: also the US/world operates on a debt based currency, weve been off the gold standard since nixon

DoctorVWA#1917: I'm almost writing a book with the failed atempts of jokes... that was a rust joke
Jimmy#8080: Oh sorry was that a joke I missed
Jimmy#8080: But my understanding is that while the US government (like most national governments) is very bad at paying back their debt, they *do* pay interest on it. So the folks buying the bonds are doing so with the expectation that the government will continue to give them money for like forever
DoctorVWA#1917: ~~please don't make it another dead joke, it would be my third today~~
Jimmy#8080: I will preface this by saying I do not know what I'm talking about and everything I say is probably wrong

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That sounds roughly the same

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: 
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: also, dont buy anything that expires in less that 20 trading days
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: as an options buyer, you never want to hold till expiry
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: hold for a few more days to see if you can make more money
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: sell it now for profit way before 4-17
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: so you have 2 choices
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: your option increases in value based on the movement of the underlying(look up option greeks)
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: if amd hits $45 tomorrow(way before 4-17) then your option is now IN THE MONEY(ITM)
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: it costs you $120 to make the bet that AMD will be below $50 by 4-17
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: that means you get the right to a $50 put option at $1.20 per share, at 100 shares means that option costs $120
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: so lets say the premium was $1.20
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: you can buy a $50 put($50 is the strike) and it will cost some amount of money for it(called premium, you pay premium when you buy an option)
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: if you wanna make a bet that by some date(lets use apr-17th) AMD will be below $50
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: lets look at both
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: 1) buy a PUT <[newline]> 2) sell a call
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: knowing this you can do several things
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: if you are a mind reader you would wanna make a bet that AMD would go down from corona virus
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: so 1 share of AMD = $60
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: lets say AMD is trading at $60
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: take AMD as an example
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: buy/sell a put
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: buy/sell a call
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: so you can
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: and put sellers must buy 100 shares at their strike price if they get assigned
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: Put buyers have the right to sell 100 shares at the strike price
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: call sellers must sell their shares at the strike price if they are assigned
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: Call options give the person buying them, the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price of the option
Deleted User#0000: ok lmao
Deleted User#0000: 1. you lose 2. you win
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: Calls and Puts
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: there are 2 options
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: so options give you the ability to leverage yourself on shares
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: dont we all haha
Deleted User#0000: what is options trading
Jimmy#8080: Basically I want to make free money without doing any work
Deleted User#0000: i'm interested
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: <@!154964593397989376> are you interested in learning about options trading or you just wanna do shares?
Deleted User#0000: so i'm gonna say it's part of north america however their terms of service may explicitly state that it is not permitted
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: haha
Deleted User#0000: if you google "central america map" you get a lot of maps where mexico is either part of the grey `void` or it's the very edge of mexico
Deleted User#0000: but the majority is north apparently
Deleted User#0000: the southern part is central america
Deleted User#0000: yeah
Deleted User#0000: north-central
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: maybe central america

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: (SOXL is a 3x leveraged ETF that tracks the SOXX semi conductor index)
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: anyway, the less safe but more likely way to make big money is buying into SOXL or shorting SOXS
Deleted User#0000: i would rather give jimmy the referrer bonus than give you the referrer bonus because communism
Deleted User#0000: i want to help jimmy get the "referrer" bonus

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: spy is the  S & P 500 index thats security backed where as spx is cash backed
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: theres an app called Robinhood, its commision free and it works great on mobile. i can give you an invite link where we both get a free share
Deleted User#0000: i thought spying was illegal or like a war crime or something
Deleted User#0000: wait there's shares in SPY?
Jimmy#8080: how do I buy stocks
Jimmy#8080: cool
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: ur safe bets are just buying some shares of either SPX, SPY, or SPXL
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: long answer <[newline]>  <[newline]> we still have a bit of a drop to go, howver if you buy in now, if you have diamond  hands to hold thru however much more we drop in 2 years we will def be breaking all time highs again
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: short answer yes
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: okay so uhh
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337:

Deleted User#0000: then how the `heck` is bernie further left than communism if he's socialist / libertarian left?
Nickproof#6817: <@!497596122890502145>  Communism is step after socialism, after socialism forms it will move to communism.
jash#0240: that's socialism
Deleted User#0000: lmfao
Deleted User#0000: an anarchist doesn't run for president
Deleted User#0000: where did you get the idea that bernie is anarchist
jash#0240: that's not communism
Nickproof#6817: Is communism. It has government, anarchist do not.
jash#0240: so that^
jash#0240: a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  They are more anarchists. Some people consider SJW as marxist and such, but they are radical right.
Deleted User#0000: how is bernie further left than communism?
Nickproof#6817: Also, libertarians are one step before anarchism, right ones are one step from anarcho-capitalism, it is like government are big corporations.
Deleted User#0000: but i'm really confused because nick claims he's communist yet that left libertarianism is further left than communism
Stenodyon#8192: interesting ü§î
Deleted User#0000: left libertarianism = bernie and stuff xd
Deleted User#0000: which is generally accepted to be on the right
Stenodyon#8192: ah

Deleted User#0000: there's left libertarianism
Deleted User#0000: one of them
Deleted User#0000: it is stenodyon
Deleted User#0000: it's not though
Stenodyon#8192: I thought libertarianism was on the right?
Nickproof#6817: But it is more left.
Deleted User#0000: neither is libertarianism
Nickproof#6817: Communism is not radical left.
Deleted User#0000: that's not... how that works
Deleted User#0000: what
Deleted User#0000: TURBOCOMMUNISM
Nickproof#6817: <@!138380569573720065>  You can go left, as libertarians.
Stenodyon#8192: unless there's something more on the left?
Stenodyon#8192: I think you can only go right from communism
Deleted User#0000: i'm one of the things nick despises
Nickproof#6817: <@!497596122890502145>  I said i am communist, Repsi is more to the right i think.

Deleted User#0000: i mean yeah
Deleted User#0000: no it's not?
Deleted User#0000: the leftism of a libertarian + the authority of a fascist
jash#0240: basically
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  It is opposite of what i want.
jash#0240: fascist
Deleted User#0000: so you want a libertarian nazi government
jash#0240: Volkswagen was helped by nazi germany
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  Communist.
Deleted User#0000: then what are *you*
Deleted User#0000: if you don't like nazis but you also don't like libertarians
jash#0240: yep
Nickproof#6817: <@!497596122890502145>  Deeper, Ford for example repaired Nazi vehicles.
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  No, now americans are different, at least now but they are now becoming libertarians, and i do not know which is worse.
jash#0240: Because they helped the US
jash#0240: They let nazi's out of custody
Deleted User#0000: are you just saying americans are nazi-like because you don't like america?

Nickproof#6817: Shall i remind you of America and Nazi Germany relationships in 1939-1945?
Deleted User#0000: i haven't met a single american that "lives like a nazi"
jash#0240: *Germ*
jash#0240: *Germany*
Deleted User#0000: america =/= nazi
Stenodyon#8192: That makes no sense
Deleted User#0000: ...what?
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  Hard to describe. I am not from that type of people, i know some that are. Usually they are Nazi or so.
Deleted User#0000: personally i wouldn't be able to describe what "living like an american" is like lmao
Deleted User#0000: i just wanna know what you mean by "live like there"
Nickproof#6817: And than we will move to religion and why it is bad for humanity.
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  Most of people here think of america as Haven on earth. So some try to live like there, usually with bad consequences, cargo cult as it is.
Stenodyon#8192: I think we should change subject as well
Deleted User#0000: what do you even mean 'live like americans'
Stenodyon#8192: This is def. not limited to the US
Nik#1011: we should change subject
Deleted User#0000: 'except ones that try to live like americans'
Nik#1011: so your problem lies purely in culture, got it
Nickproof#6817: I think most of problems with black people considered as villains are in culture of americans. As i said earlier black people here are usually better than locals. Except ones that try to live like americans, but they are rare.
Deleted User#0000: the power of controlled regurgitation

Deleted User#0000: 
Nik#1011: omg repsi
jash#0240: lol
Deleted User#0000: and some people are just spigots
jash#0240: some people are just bigots
Deleted User#0000: every freckle is a minority you oppressed
jash#0240: it would happen either way
jash#0240: well
jash#0240: to divide people
Deleted User#0000: the power of melanin
Nickproof#6817: Also humanity originated from Africa and it is worth considering.
Nickproof#6817: Also, black people have several benefits, they get sunburned rarely. And this is interesting.
Nik#1011: yeah repsi unfortunately true. skin color still affects how other people view eachother
jash#0240: where I live
jash#0240: like here
Deleted User#0000: but because of racist bias of police for example
Deleted User#0000: not because they are doing anything bad
Nickproof#6817: <@!154964593397989376>  But stereotypes make us think it is.
Deleted User#0000: but a person's skin color *can* have a causal effect on that person's incarceration
Nik#1011: mhm
Deleted User#0000: yes
jash#0240: true
Jimmy#8080: Ok let's make one thing clear in this discussion: a person's skin color has no causal effect on that person's behavior
Nickproof#6817: I think there is just funny(actually not) correlation. Most of black people here in Ukraine are nice and usually more intelligent that locals.
Deleted User#0000: now those are some cool fun facts
Deleted User#0000: in fact i'd say black people live in every state
Nik#1011: ^ true
Deleted User#0000: i can guarantee that with pretty good certainty
Deleted User#0000: black people do live there
Deleted User#0000: to answer your question
Nik#1011: oops, yes there shouldn't be a comma there. I could've phrased better.
Deleted User#0000: but yeah nick
Deleted User#0000: xd
Deleted User#0000: "that's a very weird question to ask repsi" was read as "that's a very weird question to ask, repsi"
Deleted User#0000: people not using commas has led me to put commas where there are none
Deleted User#0000: i was the object of that sentence not the person it was directed towards
jash#0240: so specific to the point where it's weird
Nik#1011: repsi it's weird because the color of their skin says nothing about the population there. The culture is important maybe, but the skin color is not representative of culture
Deleted User#0000: ok i'm retarded
Nickproof#6817: <@!138380569573720065>  I am Ukrainian and found that somewhat funny.
Deleted User#0000: wait
Stenodyon#8192: We're talking about Nick's question
jash#0240: but not weird
Deleted User#0000: i legitimately want to know
jash#0240: very specific
Deleted User#0000: how is it a weird question
Stenodyon#8192: Yes that's a very weird question
Deleted User#0000: what
Nik#1011: that's a very weird question to ask repsi
Nik#1011: 2 questions for you: <[newline]> 1, why does it matter <[newline]> 2, why do you care
Nik#1011: nick...........
jash#0240: I'mma screwed
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  Black people live there(not racist, just curiosity)?
Nik#1011: oh
jash#0240: oh
Jimmy#8080: u should go there
Nik#1011: hey there's a coronavirus quarantine less than 2 hours away from where I live
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: why does louisiana have the highest incarceration rate
Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  At least you do not live near Anthrax cow burial sites. Or plague sites.
Deleted User#0000: wtf
Deleted User#0000: don't travel neodymium magnet
Nik#1011: it's funny because the news was saying not to travel <:thonk:366065988481056769>
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  Numbers, you will be surprised.
Nik#1011: I live in seattle washington, near where the first US death from COVID-19 happened
Deleted User#0000: what's that got to do with anything
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  How much people are in US prisons?
Deleted User#0000: yes number
Deleted User#0000: numbered
Nik#1011: exactly nick
Deleted User#0000: yes
Deleted User#0000: but it is still big numeral
Nickproof#6817: It is not so dangerous as some other diseases. But one more disease to deal with is problem.
Deleted User#0000: not saying everyone will get it
Deleted User#0000: 1/50 of the USA is still 6.5 milliion people
Nik#1011: 2 flus going around the world are worse than 1, so if we can eradicate/solve/fix coronavirus then I'm happy
Nik#1011: it's still slightly deadly. comparable to the worst flu viruses we've had in the past. And it's not a fun thing to get sick anyway
Deleted User#0000: 'below' 1 in 50 is still high
Deleted User#0000: i mean
Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  So it is not so deadly.
Deleted User#0000: lol ok china
Nik#1011: <@456226577798135808> death rate from COVID-19 is theorized to realistically be below 2%, since it was so unprotected when it was first spreading, and likely many people who have the virus (and don't die) are not always going to the doctor for it
Nickproof#6817: Or not not. We never know.
Deleted User#0000: not
Deleted User#0000: happy birthday to me

Deleted User#0000: like 3% chance or something
Deleted User#0000: it's somewhat deadly
Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  As far as i know it is originated from bats.
Ecconia#4929: I just said it would be happy.............‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Nickproof#6817: <@!151293812675706880>  It is not deadly. Not like H1N1 (also from china).
Nik#1011: hmm <@!151293812675706880> if coronavirus types had emotions, they'd probably be sad if humanity died. no more things to infect
Deleted User#0000: what if our lord and savior pizzus chrust doesn't obey the big numbers law

Nik#1011: WOOX IT WAS A JOKE
Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  Some bacterial infection? Pox maybe.
woox2k#0693: itsn ot hard, physical destruction is what you need
Nik#1011: no one would be left to use the data
Nik#1011: then just destroy humanity instead
Nik#1011: if destroying the data is so hard
Nickproof#6817: It will stand.
Nik#1011: I have an idea
Nik#1011: wait guys
Ecconia#4929: ceramic vs 2000¬∞ #fight
woox2k#0693: disk platters used to be aluminium ... now they are mostly glass since glass expands way less than aluminium with heat
Nickproof#6817: <@!151293812675706880>  In chemical means, not like ceramics you normally see.
Ecconia#4929: ceramic disk? flowerpot?
Deleted User#0000: ceramic disk? wtf?
woox2k#0693: ceramic disk? wtf?
Ecconia#4929: I am talking about industrial ovens intended to smelt iron and stuff
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808>  Disk itself is ceramic. I have bunch of these.
Deleted User#0000: ezpz
Deleted User#0000: then remove the shielding
woox2k#0693: but then again there might be patterns emerging in that randomness and that might give something away
Nickproof#6817: <@!151293812675706880>  Some disks, especially ones that are first target of destruction shielded from that.
Deleted User#0000: just melt it and resell it as a broken magnet
woox2k#0693: random fill, thats pretty good
Deleted User#0000: ^
Ecconia#4929: Throw it in the high tempature oven üòÑ
Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  What do you want?
woox2k#0693: if you know the new data is exactly the same you can find anomalies and work out the old data from there
Nik#1011: guyssssssssssssssssssss
Deleted User#0000: or just heat it to the curie point
woox2k#0693: hdd doesnt just flip magnetism around... it does it... well enough... theres still hints of old data there
Ecconia#4929: The atoms will remain üò±
Nickproof#6817: Physical disc destruction is only way to erase data entirely.
woox2k#0693: thats why drive thats overwritten with zeroes or ones is not safe way to destroy data
Nickproof#6817: <@!243491832544100353>  That is why we use explosives to destroy it.
Nik#1011: 
woox2k#0693: also dont underestimate the process of low level data recovery
Nickproof#6817: I do not consider this creature as cute.
Nik#1011: 
Nik#1011: well great
Nickproof#6817: I hate cats.
Nik#1011: not arguing
Nik#1011: laughing or something
Nickproof#6817: What reaction you expected.
Nik#1011: this picture is nice
Nik#1011: here let's look at this picture
Nik#1011: 
Nik#1011: welp my silly joke video did not have the reaction I intended
Nickproof#6817: If you know how HDD works, you will know that data is pasted on it via magnetic field, if magnetized it will rearrange irreversibly.
Nik#1011: I mean the pros would probably be fired, but it's possible
Nik#1011: yeah but there's still only 1 copy of the data on that drive so accidents can happen even in the hands of professionals
woox2k#0693: as in price
woox2k#0693: its just the effort required that sets the limits
woox2k#0693: data recovery is always possible if the data itself is intact
Nickproof#6817: <@!243491832544100353>  Problem is that it does not recover data.
woox2k#0693: and those are things
Nik#1011: that'll always work
woox2k#0693: true that will work.. then they will be demagnetizers
Nik#1011: guys just shred it
Nik#1011: <@!243491832544100353> well data recovery is not always possible after the rest of the drive is destroyed
Nickproof#6817: <@!243491832544100353>  Than use electric magnet connected to AC.
woox2k#0693: not just one strong one
woox2k#0693: wiping the data requires constantly changing magnetic field
woox2k#0693: it will destroy the heads and other mechanical precision parts not the data
Nik#1011: :D
Nik#1011: best way to delete everything is secure erase the device with more than 1 pass, and then shred/disolve the drive
Nickproof#6817: <@!243491832544100353>  I have tried, powerful enough (maybe electric magnet) will destroy HDD.
woox2k#0693: unless you attach it to a drill and spin it really fast near the platters
woox2k#0693: magnet doesnt work
Nik#1011: ah man, I thought having my password as "1337" was funny enough, but I should've had a browser open in the background with a google search for "cool linux commands" or something
Nickproof#6817: Best way to `rm -rf` is to use powerful magnet on your HDD. It will clean up your disk and destroy it irreversibly.
Nik#1011: well... looks like I have to lmao
Ecconia#4929: So you gonna install arch again?
Nik#1011: it lives!
Nik#1011: avoids the need for `--no-preserve-root`
Nickproof#6817: Barmin patch?
Nik#1011: I did `/*` which isn't detected as root
Ecconia#4929: `sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root`

Zaxabock#0013: It was never a discussion, lol. No idea why you brought up atheism like that, you can be really weird sometimes when you overanalyze. üòõ
Nickproof#6817: Yes and i will not continue this discussion because it will be boring, at least i will be boring and maybe even total nerd like.
Zaxabock#0013: Ok Nick x)
Nickproof#6817: Yes, it loses meaning in that case, but as for atheist it has no sacred meaning.
Zaxabock#0013: For me, 666 loses its meaning when there's more than three sixes <:thenking:446109302369812490>  Just my opinion, just saw the review randomly and thought "Lol, that is a funny coincidence"
Nickproof#6817: And which is worse forever 666 or forever 69, i think 666 is better.
Nickproof#6817: Ok, just saw Dante in review and thought of that.

FacePox#2708: I don‚Äôt want to leave everyone I know

Jimmy#8080: I'm sorry this project didn't go well for you
Dragon Lord#6944: oh well. i'll try to figure it out later
Dragon Lord#6944: Not really. It was all difficulty with syntax and trying to figure out what I was supposed to do -as opposed to with what was going on- because the guys making the problems are comp sci grad students and thought it was 'not that hard'. Bruh, i've never used threads, and you didn't explain the problem! You can't expect me to use threads without *any* prior knowlege, let alone apply them to a problem that isn't sufficiently documented!
Jimmy#8080: at least you learned a lot?
Dragon Lord#6944: i put well over 12 hours into that project, made 2 files, and only got ~200-300 lines of code written. It compiles and gives pretty output, but not the right output, and it gets stuck halfway through.

Not only am I extensively trained in compliments, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Cuddle Division and I will use it to its full extent to hug your big impressive compassion off the face of the hate world, you little cutey. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little lovely comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you could have hugged your wonderful mother. But you could, you did, and now you 're paying the reward price, you extraordinary sweety. I will tickle with fury all over you and you will drown in happiness. You 're freaking awesome, kiddo.

Nik#1011: oh just the toes, nevermind nobody needs toes
Saltypretzel#0321: Sorry for bad timing
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: because nik isn‚Äôt insulted by it
Nik#1011: SOMEONE STEPED ON THEIR FRIEND?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i know, but my statement ‚Äúyou better apologize to nik this instant‚Äù *is* actually a joke
Zaxabock#0013: Confusion ensues, I love that ya'll are so careful about stepping friends on the toes üòÑ
Saltypretzel#0321: It wasn‚Äôt a joke
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it wasn‚Äôt a good joke though :p
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i made a joke about you possibly insulting nik with it, because of the poor timing.
Saltypretzel#0321: Because I actually feel that reality is disconnecting because things don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù right this week
Nik#1011: nah
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you didn‚Äôt
Saltypretzel#0321: Wait did I offend anyone with my statement?
Nik#1011: salty?
Nik#1011: who were you telling to apolgize?
Nik#1011: ooh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but i made a joke about apologizing to you because it would‚Äôve been insulting (it wasn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs why it was a joke)
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: in that case good, cuz it wasn‚Äôt meant to offend you in the first place
Nik#1011: ..... I think
Nik#1011: but I'm glad you're trying to be nice about something that didn't offend me in the first place
Nik#1011: I actually really don't know what you're referring to
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: by which i don‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay to say such things, but... well, i‚Äôm sure you understand
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i was talking mostly about how nik‚Äôs confession of being gay was followed up with ‚Äúwhy does chat become so weird overtime‚Äù (which wasn‚Äôt aimed at nik, i know, i was joking too)
Jimmy#8080: minimal > nothing
Jimmy#8080: good for you!
Nik#1011: don't care that much, I'll continue to live my life and make somewhat minimal efforts towards fixing widespread issues
Nik#1011: really
Nik#1011: Jimmy I really
Jimmy#8080: Drought. Famine. Poverty. Cruelty. Overpriced fast food. I take responsibility for it all, and I apologize
Jimmy#8080: nik I am sorry for all the evils of the world
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you better apologize to nik this instant
Saltypretzel#0321: Yes plausible
Jimmy#8080: It's a causal effect. This chat gets weirder, which decreases the mental processing capabilities of those who read it, which makes it weirder, ect
Saltypretzel#0321: Are my mental processing capabilities decreasing or is it that the chat is getting weirder and weirder every-time I come back
Zaxabock#0013: Well you're obviously a lot of fun 8-)
Stefan#5422: It was I dio
Nik#1011: wait who told you

Nik#1011: omg rrly?
Jimmy#8080: nik gay
Jimmy#8080: nik
Jimmy#8080: ink gay
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it would be impossible to be straight or gay or bi or whatever if genders were nonexistent
Nik#1011: government database systems?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: i found yet another thing that‚Äôd completely break if genders were yeeted
Stefan#5422: hot take: being gay is not gay

Stenodyon#8192: oof :(
Nik#1011: pro tip: don't do embarrassing things
Nik#1011: Also I regret doing that
Nik#1011: particularly when I was somewhere between 12-14, I went to my fav minecraft server to announce my newly-found gayness. Nobody reacted
Nik#1011: <@!229403258278510593> I missed your question. For the most part people ignored my self-realizations unless I started talking about them
daimondweter#8284: Lol I cant handle seeing my own weird messages

daimondweter#8284: Bobby is like Jimmy's literal colored shadow that is only able to sleep when its day, but because Jimmy is awake then and sleeps at night, Bobby gets no rest
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: bobby will be so shiney you‚Äôll be unable to type negative comments again

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or they fear jimmy‚Äôs wrath
daimondweter#8284: Actually, multiple reasons for that. 1. no random anonymous people, so afraid of what will happen ifff it would be said. 2. Cool community. 3. OH OH and mind warping, I mean look how much brain change Jimmy is able to do <[newline]> > and the best part is that there has not been a single person who has typed something like ‚Äúeww‚Äù or ‚Äúy‚Äôall weird‚Äù <[newline]> <@!319035388868034560>

daimondweter#8284: (let the stupidity flow in)
daimondweter#8284: I want to eat apple
ForLoveOfCats#4111: How did your social/family circles adapt to your realizations?
Nik#1011: I will bundle my messages together.
daimondweter#8284: How I feel (and how definitely not everyone has to feel or even is able to just choose to feel) is that Im just a male, but that doesnt mean I got put in a box. Its my choice who I want to be and how I want to be. "IIIIIIIIm spiderman!", "Noooo, I am spiderman, you are hulk"
ForLoveOfCats#4111: <@!154964593397989376> I've recently started reading HN and destroyed my Reddit subreddit list. There is a lot less content overall due to being so much smaller but it is more focused so I've still gotten interesting brainy stuff to read but less of it to browse endlessly.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That hits home real hard
Nik#1011: at 12 I realized I like men, joked about being gay but feared it internally <[newline]>  <[newline]> at 13 I realized I was, actually, pretty gosh darn gay. Started having really stupid thoughts like "oh, what would a GAY person do in this situation??" <[newline]>  <[newline]> at 15 I realized I was probably bi, but I didn't know how to think about my sexuality correctly <[newline]>  <[newline]> at 16ish I learned about the Kinsey scale, which helped me realize I was normal <[newline]>  <[newline]> and finally at 18/19 I realized I was afraid of using the word "bi" for some reason, started acknowledging and fixing the issue, and started feeling more secure about myself
Nik#1011: uh
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: People not using Reddit probably use recycled Reddit memes on Instagram so it doesn't matter
Jimmy#8080: <@119734190571913216> tell us more about your journey of self-discovery
Nik#1011: that's the real hot take
Jimmy#8080: idgaf about new people reddit is too big already
Nik#1011: which is good and bad. It's good for functionality but it's bad because it deters new people
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ü§£
Jimmy#8080: <@229403258278510593> god damn it this is <#403343343775383552> we MUST stay on topic
Nik#1011: old reddit is more dense
Nik#1011: I had to get over several personal fears
ForLoveOfCats#4111: <offtopic>Hot take: Old reddit is superior</offtopic>

I wasn't sure how I felt about the issue before I read it, but after reading it and thinking about the points people made, I disagree with you. <[newline]> https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ex76zy/cmv_transpeople_should_disclose_that_theyre_trans/
Nik#1011: üìß lmao
Nik#1011: anyway, gender (as a social construct) is a part of many cultures now, and it would be impossible to just remove it instantly. In the future I wish it to disappear, but maybe it won't because it's also part of human nature
Jimmy#8080: I am sure you will be cute as heck
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: That too! In case you haven't noticed from the three different related topics I talked about in the last half an hour, I myself am currently going through somewhat of a "curious" phase. Not that I feel like I want to be a girl, or a trans or whatever, but I just wonder what it'd feel like to be a cute girl. Not for long, not permanently, just for the experience.
Nik#1011: <@!154964593397989376> problem is if someone is trans, identifies as male, but has female organs, any potential partners should know both before committing to anything. So I guess I'm saying that specifying gender beforehand isn't productive
daimondweter#8284: DEFINITELY NOT SAYING THAT MEANS THAT IT FULLY AFFECTS IT, oh and there are a lot of factors with not just a little impact in sooo many things around us
daimondweter#8284: <@!319035388868034560> Definitely, I really agree, but I also think at least a part of what causes it is the different ways our bodies develop (Im talking about things that can affect mental thoughts and the way we feel when we behave a certain way)
Zaxabock#0013: In that case?
Zaxabock#0013: Is it wrong to use greetings "Hi there miss"
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Non-traditional sex is still classified as sex, if two people find each other attractive and understand what sex each other are physically then where lies the issue?
Stefan#5422: spontanious thurstday is gender real
Stenodyon#8192: sexuality or identity for that matter
Jimmy#8080: <@229403258278510593> how do we fit sexuality into this perfect genderless society? Sex is a part of being human, and for most non-pansexual individuals, gender is a big part of sex.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Just because you've never been that way, curiosity. Or perhaps wanting to escape from the things people expect of you, something like that.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Hot take: because society pressures people into being the gender they are, many tall, strong guys will yearn to be cute, and many smaller cute girls will yearn to be very manly and strong
ForLoveOfCats#4111: In English "they" is a suitable singular pronoun, in fact Shakespeare used it as thus in one of his works
Zaxabock#0013: In terms of language, we use He / She / It and also neuter <:thenking:446109302369812490>
daimondweter#8284: I say that a problem (which we dont just solve (and has a lot of advantages)) is that any kind of communication gets interpreted and shared in such a way that it starts to activate a sort of feeling or idea in people when they sense it.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Let people be whatever person they want to be, but don't catagorize them as one thing or another. Just let them be themself
Stefan#5422: If its determined by physical labor I'm female af
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm not advocating for removing people's identities, simply define them outside these terms of gender. You can be a rough hardworking outdoors person or not, that doesn't mean that that individual is "manly" or not.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Imagine me, 1m80, dressing up as a girl. Now that's a good meme
Stefan#5422: and depressed
Stefan#5422: I Idenitfy as a attack helicopter
Stenodyon#8192: Wait, is gender 100% a social construct? I thought there was physiological evidence to people being trans
Zaxabock#0013: Once again we're bad with channels Jimmy üòÇ
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: They are
Nik#1011: I wouldnt say it makes you anything other than dressed in a particular way

Nik#1011: I agree with jimmy
Jimmy#8080: <@319035388868034560> I say it makes you whatever you say you are
Zaxabock#0013: Haha üòÑ
Zaxabock#0013: Just like envy is wanting somethingwhat others have and jealousy is the fear of losing something you have to someone else.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Let's take an example: I dress up as a girl. What does that make me? Just curious to hear what you'd say
Jimmy#8080: <@229403258278510593> what would you say to the fact that many people enjoy being the gender they are? By removing the gender part of our culture, would we not be denying those people happiness?

daimondweter#8284: or just forget it

daimondweter#8284: Turner syndrome <[newline]> > I heard that it is possible to miss the full x/y chromosome <[newline]> <@!565587902570954782>
Nik#1011: that's the terms nowadays, but try explaining that to my grandparents. they're..... uh. kinda sexist and definitely racist
Jimmy#8080: <@319035388868034560> `gender` is purely phsychological; `sex` is purely biological
Nik#1011: I agree cats
Stefan#5422: -_-
ForLoveOfCats#4111: At this point if "gender" is such a removed concept from one's physical sex, why should it exist at all? Why catagorize individuals into such tracks if it is no longer an accurate represntation of anything. Everyone is different and indentifying as one thing or another is always a simplifcation of the individual. As a society we are so close to killing off traditional gender roles, why not kill of the concept of gender entirely?
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: :p
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: <@256359653124997120> I had to go through that and so do you
daimondweter#8284: And only have an x
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: If you have to, make gender fixed to "vagina or dick", and use a separate term for how you actually feel, as being a "male" nowadays doesn't have much meaning. It can be biological or mental, and that's something that I think can be fixed.
daimondweter#8284: I heard that it is possible to miss the full x/y chromosome
Stefan#5422: <@!319035388868034560> what did you just make me think about
daimondweter#8284: Even though I think there are (I think) real cases of people with chromosomes that wouldn't make them either male or female.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: Not because I don't think people should be able to be what they want, but because I am still confused whenever I see "male tampons" in the store
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: I just wish people would separate biological gender and mental gender

daimondweter#8284: (TIME DOESNT SPEED DOWN WHEN JIMMY PUTS IN ENERGY, BUT IT GOES FASTER)

Jimmy#8080: that's how hot my hot takes are
daimondweter#8284: lol, jimmy send his message in the future if I compare it to my time
Jimmy#8080: You're acknowledging that gender is a social construct, not an absolute truth of biology. And you're saying that the social construct we have for gender in this society is not inclusive enough.
Jimmy#8080: Right, okay. Reading this over it's more woke than I initially thought it was.
Nik#1011: and a few people I know feel like the general US population's assumptions about males and females don't apply to them very well, so they consider themselves non-binary
Nik#1011: this was my understanding of the situation, that the ideas of "male" and "female" include the medical differences, but also unfortunately include a lot of other assumptions about the person's personality, identity, and more
Nik#1011: Aaah I forgot to include my usual "I think" at the beginning
Jimmy#8080: <@119734190571913216>  <[newline]> > ugh, the whole case of gender fluidity comes from how much people associate gender with unrelated things. Now lots more people are feeling like the other assumptions that come with their gender aren't an accurate representation/identity of themselves, so they're telling people they're NOT that gender to be identified properly <[newline]> I think this is a pretty arrogant view of nonbinary identities. Why do you presume to understand the reasons for a person's identity better than the person themself does?
Nik#1011: accurate representation of realistic human conversations
Stenodyon#8192: "what's your gender?" "no"
Stenodyon#8192: lol
Nik#1011: idk what type of code it is so I haven't bothered verifying
Nik#1011: my dad says that means null
Nik#1011: on the code on the back, the section for gender is a ">" character
Nik#1011: I can't wait for some ID scanner somewhere to give errors because my useless gender is unspecified
Nik#1011: yes it's not available everywhere in US but it's possible where I live
Stenodyon#8192: Oooh I didn't know you could do that (well at least in the US)
Nik#1011: haven't gotten my ID card re-printed yet, though.
Nik#1011: I changed my reported gender on my govornment ID to "X" recently üòÑ
Stenodyon#8192: I agree, it shouldn't matter so much which gender you are <[newline]> French does that too btw, like a tables or doors are female‚Ä¶ highways or afternoons are non-binary though
Nik#1011: I mean spanish assigns gender to literally any noun ever. Like tables are female, apparently.
Nik#1011: realistically, the only persons who need to know your gender are your doctor(s) and people you interact with sexually. No strangers, acquaintances, colleagues, friends, or even family need to know. Yet many languages just specify gender for no damn reason
Nik#1011: it just comes from how much humans make stupid assumptions and judgements based on little info
Nik#1011: ugh, the whole case of gender fluidity comes from how much people associate gender with unrelated things. Now lots more people are feeling like the other assumptions that come with their gender aren't an accurate representation/identity of themselves, so they're telling people they're NOT that gender to be identified properly
Nik#1011: good thing my cousin has stopped identifying as a person, too

Deleted User#0000: what do you mean by a bit of force?
Deleted User#0000: ok
Deleted User#0000: it lasts like 3 months apparently
Zaxabock#0013: ALso here's another trick, clench your fist shut as hard as you can for a whole minute then extremely carefully try to open it up and you'll notice you have to use a bit of force to actually open it
Deleted User#0000: don't do it
DoctorVWA#1917: I'm just not patient enough to do it xd

Nik#1011: I love it
Zaxabock#0013: 
Nik#1011: so the entire thing is sensitive
Nik#1011: so the entire URL is the "key", not just the last section of it
Nik#1011: if you mess up any part of the URL, your captions don't work
Nik#1011: I mean from the perspective of the interface for closed captioning software, the entire URL is a code
Deleted User#0000: and they won't click the little eyeball with a slash wondering what would happen
Nik#1011: because it is sensitive!
Nik#1011: yeah from a user-interface perspective, censoring the whole link will clue the user into believing the link is sensitive..........
Deleted User#0000: idk
Deleted User#0000: or something
Deleted User#0000: censoring the whole link would probably be better because it would be more obvious it's censored i think
Nickproof#6817: And than censor
Nickproof#6817: You can censor whole link in textbox, or we can split it to label and textbox.
Nickproof#6817: We all not sure.
Nik#1011: I'M NOT SURE ANYMORE
Saltypretzel#0321: wait what are you trying to debate about
Deleted User#0000: instead of just the stream key
Deleted User#0000: nik just wishes the link (containing the stream key) was censored too
Nik#1011: what
Deleted User#0000: what
Nickproof#6817: Closed caption slider?
Nik#1011: ............ just scroll up lol
Nickproof#6817: Sorry, i missed your point, repeat it please.
Nik#1011: I don't understand what you're saying, and also you're ignoring my point while I'm not ignoring yours
Deleted User#0000: good <#403343343775383552>
Deleted User#0000: *bruh*
Nickproof#6817: POST request is just request that doesnt have limits unlike GET, and dont show up,
Nik#1011: and what you have is a URL with a sensitive key in it. So... sensor it.
Nik#1011: but typical captioning does not use these methods....... so... work with what you have
Nik#1011: like, I understand that there are more elegant ways to transfer information across the internet
Nik#1011: yes
Deleted User#0000: ?
Deleted User#0000: why are you so opposed to important key censorship
Nickproof#6817: <@456226577798135808> just  add `request=post` in form.
Nik#1011: then that would be an error on youtube's part
Nik#1011: if youtube didn't support the closed captioning equipment that every company already had
Nik#1011: closed captioning software is not very specialized
Deleted User#0000: 'just use' isn't an excuse for lazy design
Nickproof#6817: It dont show up in URL.
Nickproof#6817: Just use POST request.
Nik#1011: it's just as sensitive information as the stream key itself
Nik#1011: no it wouldn't.....
Nickproof#6817: Censoring URL will be `–∫–æ—Å—Ç—ã–ª—å`.
Deleted User#0000: it's super difficult to censor only one part of a string of text
Nickproof#6817: Also, POST captions to URL.
Deleted User#0000: that's too hard
Nik#1011: in the interface
Nik#1011: they can still censor the URL
Nickproof#6817: Because they dont use HTTP POST requests, only GET.
Jimmy#8080: more like pootube lmao goteem
Nik#1011: thanks youtube

Nickproof#6817: Yeah, change it for aerogel.
ZephyrZ80#6195: But again, better to disturb it by removing it under controlled conditions, than waiting for it to get disturbed in uncontrolled conditions.
Nickproof#6817: Asbestos dust particles are small, but asbestos is very good thermal insulator and cheap one.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Yes, I know.
Nickproof#6817: Moving also disturbance.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Just make sure you're wearing the proper PPE.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Better to remove it than wait until it gets disturbed.
Nickproof#6817: It isnt dangerous until you disturb it. It causes lung cancer as i know, because asbestos crystals have pointy structure and they come off very easy.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Isn't that why he's dealing with the removal?
Nickproof#6817: Because cancer

Deleted User#0000: nsfw content aside
Deleted User#0000: this is not a very well made sign
Deleted User#0000: stop talking lmfao
Deleted User#0000: stop
Saltypretzel#0321: I mean you just make a survey
Deleted User#0000: ew
Saltypretzel#0321: well UTIs/km^2 is a valid measurement also
Nickproof#6817: Found this in russian Warhammer40K community, why?
Deleted User#0000: uTi stands for something else xd
Saltypretzel#0321: haha
Deleted User#0000: well
Deleted User#0000: i didn't want to say uTi because
Deleted User#0000: i know
Saltypretzel#0321: T actually stands for teslas in electronics
Saltypretzel#0321: zoos
Deleted User#0000: this is probably an accurate measurement of tigers in an area for most parts of the world
Saltypretzel#0321: the tubes are the hard things to find, the rest is simple
Deleted User#0000: 2.5 uT/km^2
Saltypretzel#0321: yes you cant without a Geiger Muller tube though
Saltypretzel#0321: how many microtigers have you  counted yet
Deleted User#0000: it counts the tigers üêÖ
Nickproof#6817: <@!371851806067654657>  I can create one myself.
Deleted User#0000: i have a tiger counter
Saltypretzel#0321: I have a Geiger counter

Nickproof#6817: Where is G point type of learning.
Deleted User#0000: and since it was 6th grade it was mostly just immature 12 year olds laughing at the p and v words
Deleted User#0000: neither semester did i actually learn anything
Deleted User#0000: and then keyboarding 2nd semester
Deleted User#0000: it was Health first semester (which was just sex ed)
Deleted User#0000: i had a class about it in 6th grade
Nickproof#6817: Just google how this can happen, this will make you laugh/trying to replicate/masturbate.
Saltypretzel#0321: well  its just warning you to breathe while you do your activities
Nickproof#6817: So good that in ukraine we dont have sex ed, we have more useful classes.
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: sex ed is purely scientific but i don't think jimmy would appreciate us talking to someone about it in his server
Nickproof#6817: Also this term is purely scientific so no NSFW.
Nickproof#6817: Not him alone died of Auto-Erotic asphyxiation.
Deleted User#0000: you know what's the worst killer though
Saltypretzel#0321: constipation ranks 2167 deaths
Deleted User#0000: epic
Deleted User#0000: i don't think so because it's text
Deleted User#0000: i'm not sure if this violates rule 3
Saltypretzel#0321: and contact with lawnmower ranks 900 deaths
Nickproof#6817: This man died this way.
Saltypretzel#0321: interesting
Deleted User#0000: oof
Nickproof#6817: You know i think more people died of auto asphyxiation while masturbating than coronavirus killed.
Saltypretzel#0321: its spreading, but china has got it under control
Deleted User#0000: oh, it's up to 100 now?
Saltypretzel#0321: only 100 died of virus
Saltypretzel#0321: 150 people died of coconuts
Deleted User#0000: i'm tired of hearing people talking about china's coronavirus

Deleted User#0000: i know britain is +6 from me
Saltypretzel#0321: why are you talking in memes
Deleted User#0000: but that's just because i don't have the size of europe memorized for timezone calculations

Nickproof#6817: Im being not sleeping for almost 30 hours, so i can make mistakes.
Deleted User#0000: big difference
Deleted User#0000: messages =/= massages
Deleted User#0000: massages
Nickproof#6817: Basically US is just 50 or so countries. So it is confusing, also election system is confusing, and the most strange thing is taxes, here in ukraine you receive massages how much you need to pay.
Deleted User#0000: rip
Deleted User#0000: or not
Deleted User#0000: nickproof is typing
Deleted User#0000: idk
Nickproof#6817: Question sign.
Deleted User#0000: maybe the idea of federal / state is confusing to people not from the US
Deleted User#0000: "if the federal limit is 7.25 minimum, states must have their minimum wage set to >= 7.25"
Deleted User#0000: and math
Deleted User#0000: that's like basic law
Deleted User#0000: lmao i don't even see how you can make that mistake
Nickproof#6817: Sorry, misread `>=` as `<=`, working at night isnt good for me.
Deleted User#0000: what about it
Nickproof#6817: Greed.
Deleted User#0000: i don't see why not
Deleted User#0000: can cities impose their own minimum wages that are >= the state minimum wage?
Deleted User#0000: but *eh*
Nickproof#6817: Capitalists.
Deleted User#0000: i guess that's to give more freedom to companies
Deleted User#0000: notice how many states stick to that limit lmao
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: 7.25 is actually the federal limit
Deleted User#0000: oh shit
DoctorVWA#1917: yes, argentina get the cheapest, probally around 3$
Nickproof#6817: <@!527553031613710368>  Even cheaper for me, in Ukraine region it will cost less than 5$, in Russia it will cost less than 4$ i think.
Deleted User#0000: maybe 7.50
Deleted User#0000: in texas i think it's 7.25
Deleted User#0000: Cost / (% positive reviews * expected hours playtime)
Jimmy#8080: damn I keep forgetting how criminally low US minimum wage is
Deleted User#0000: that is how i determine whether a game will be worth my money or not
Deleted User#0000: speaking of pricing and minimum wage
Deleted User#0000: lmao
Deleted User#0000: that is nearly 2 hours minimum wage!
Deleted User#0000: !
Jimmy#8080: Logic World will launch at $12 in the US, and we'll have regional pricing for every region Steam supports
Jimmy#8080: Thanks for preserving history <@456226577798135808> . It sounded saltier than I actually am, hence the deletion
Deleted User#0000: ok mr factory rise
DoctorVWA#1917: I will pay less than you dollar folks xd, generaly 10$ games costs around 20~25 BRL in steam, which is around 4~5$
Deleted User#0000: "Logic world is the product of thousands of hours of work, y'all can cough up 1 hour of minimum wage" <[newline]> -paraphrased of jimmy's deleted message
Deleted User#0000: LW will cost $8.40
Deleted User#0000: confirmed
Deleted User#0000: canada's minimum wage is roughly $8.40 USD
cmoa#8392: 
Deleted User#0000: jimmy said it'd cost 1 hour of minimum wage
Jimmy#8080: nice try though

Jimmy#8080: working on it right now

DoctorVWA#1917: jimmy skull head tattoo
DoctorVWA#1917: actually listened to the video
DoctorVWA#1917: seeing the subtitles help hearing it, I first watched the video without looking to it
Deleted User#0000: whether that's just an extension of the effect that starting a conversation generally creates a conversation or *not*, who knows
Deleted User#0000: expressing criticism / cynicism towards a subject tends to lead others to do the same
Deleted User#0000: that's an interesting effect
DoctorVWA#1917: I actually didn't recognized nothing that the first one said, the second really looked like something, but probally still a bunch of coincidences with the funny sounds that the cats make
a dragon#6911: the thumbnail, title, and channel name reek of this being just a funny cat video with no actual meaning
Deleted User#0000: i now realize that is not two questions
Deleted User#0000: 1. what does this actually communicate between cats <[newline]> 2. a lot of them seem to lick their mouths a lot when they do this which makes me wonder whether this has any negative effects on the cat <[newline]> 3. how much of this is just humans recognizing humanlike things and how much is actually cats learning language?

Nik#1011: nahh MGE doesn't work well as spy unless you agree to meele only
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I'm down to MGE though, those are always fun
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I was playing scout at the time
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Oh I was not the one who got the stab lol
Nik#1011: degroot keep best map
Nik#1011: I haven't played tf2 in a few years but I got pretty good
Nik#1011: <@!229403258278510593> wanna do a trickstab battle
ForLoveOfCats#4111: However TF2 is has been in development in some form for at least 20 years thus it is a common meme that the countless game bugs are due to the "spaghetti" we can only imagine lives in the game's code
ForLoveOfCats#4111: there is a subdomain of practice known as "trickstabbing" where you bait other players into specific movements which allow you to maneuver behind them for a backstab
ForLoveOfCats#4111: TF2 has a playable character called the Spy who can stab people from behind for an instant kill
ForLoveOfCats#4111: This is a screenshot of TF2 which is built in the Source engine
ZephyrZ80#6195: wat
ZephyrZ80#6195: ...
ForLoveOfCats#4111: 
Nickproof#6817: It will treat you like that.
Nickproof#6817: Yep, also this game will think you are `–ª–æ—Ö` if in russian. So.
Zaxabock#0013: Looks hilarious üòÑ
Nickproof#6817: Not fully destructible but pretty much.
Nickproof#6817: The game is voxel with destructible terrain.
Zaxabock#0013: Grew up with an Amiga
Zaxabock#0013: I'm used to old graphics, no worries there üòÑ
Nickproof#6817: Also Vangers are type of game that has no tutorials or user friendly things.
Nickproof#6817: Aside STALKER but in russian context, play Vangers, this will blow your mind out, but be aware that this game was released in 1998 and was ported to win7 and win10 and linux no so long ago. So graphics will be not good, but this is awesome game.
Nickproof#6817: Destroy them.
Zaxabock#0013: Yes, I am still not sure if I would join the dream or destroy it
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  Are you are talking about Monolith?
Nickproof#6817: Try to read some books, most of them are good, Andrei Lunev trilogy from Vyacheslav Shalygin, pretty good i think.
Zaxabock#0013: The Wish Granter is interesting though, its very ironical, the way it fulfills the wishes
Zaxabock#0013: Controllers leading stray stalkers into the town center and having their zombie hordes tear them apart
Zaxabock#0013: No, just fanmade stories üôÇ
Nickproof#6817: Returning to STALKER, have you read any book?
Nickproof#6817: Maybe.
Zaxabock#0013: Siren: Blood Curse?
Nickproof#6817: That can happen in next few decades so.
Zaxabock#0013: It's kinda difficult seeing your species has been out-evolutioned though
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  Yeah.
Zaxabock#0013: SINGING PIPES
Zaxabock#0013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIGcNjXFwoA
Nickproof#6817: It crushes you psychologically.
Zaxabock#0013: I am just terrified easily since I feel like the characters life is my own life üòÖ
Nickproof#6817: It isnt that scary.
Zaxabock#0013: Another scary game is of course Metro 2033
Nickproof#6817: Snorks are awful and poltergeists are awful.
Nickproof#6817: In russian they are called `—Ç—É—à–∫–∞–Ω—ã`.
Zaxabock#0013: Whaaa
Nickproof#6817: They arent rats actually.
Zaxabock#0013: Blood drinkers.. So much scary
Zaxabock#0013: Blind dogs and rat swarms üò∞
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  You can survive blowout if you have special perk or eat special medicine.
Zaxabock#0013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwaJhYv9FYE
Zaxabock#0013: Zone blowouts, those were special
Zaxabock#0013: And an infinite stream of nuts and bolts to throw into anomalies
Nickproof#6817: Bad idea, worst in Call of Pripyat.
Zaxabock#0013: Also you can give them first-aid if I remember, and sort of befriend them / be at truce
Nickproof#6817: You know, that bandits in STALKER actually tell you where they are going and what they are doing.
Zaxabock#0013: Imagine living in such a wasteland, hunted by the military and shunned by the world
Zaxabock#0013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_-fba2hBG4
Nickproof#6817: Also STALKER has books, and also STALKER2 will come out soon on UE4, but it wont be EpicStore exclusive (they know if they will release exclusively there they will fail).
Zaxabock#0013: LOVED the Russian campfire songs
Zaxabock#0013: Yup, this is know! I paid a lot of attention to the release and was... disappointed v_v
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  Fun thing, STALKER game series arent even a fraction from what should had to come out, but releasing company wanted money so the game was left as in alpha version.
Zaxabock#0013: I have an interest in Chernobyl because of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R game series üòÖ
Nickproof#6817: There is zone called Ginger Forest.
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  In Chernobyl all are orange.
Zaxabock#0013: Green because radiation? Chernobyl? <a:you_thonk_me_right_round:453669433634979840> (I joke)
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  It isnt visible in summer, when all becomes green.
Zaxabock#0013: Not so nice when it ruins the view, haha :b
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  We also have that type of pipes, it transfers water and heat, the part of this pipelining are visible from my window.
Zaxabock#0013: Some of our sidewalks have heat cables in them actually, it's quite luxurious
Zaxabock#0013: There's also underground piping which redirects heavy industry heat to homes
Zaxabock#0013: You set a temperature and it trickles those in little by little to keep it stable
Zaxabock#0013: 
Zaxabock#0013: Also pellet ovens are an alternative
Zaxabock#0013: Centralized heating is very nice
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315> We get heaters up every winter, and because this is all centralized it is working for everyone. Also we i can see at least 2 water boiling stations from windows of my apartment.
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  We have 20C indoors both winter and summer. Building designed that way.
Zaxabock#0013: THough you are not allowed to just randomly go and chop any kind of tree down in Norway. It is owned by the state.
Zaxabock#0013: I am heating my home with fresh wood, 30C indoors üôÇ
Nickproof#6817: Also heaters connected.
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  Good, unless the sound is banging on heaters which are made from steel.
Zaxabock#0013: Probably takes forever changing the temperature too :b
Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  Yeah, that is problem.
Zaxabock#0013: Oooouch
Nik#1011: good wifi isolation too, lol
Zaxabock#0013: Good sound isolation? ü§î
Nik#1011: niiiice
Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  Im living in soviet made apartment, walls here are more that 10cm thick, made from iron and concrete.
Zaxabock#0013: Walking along the street when hey-presto, the ground swallows you
Nik#1011: also I think a bridge is stronger than a floor, since most bridges are supposed to support many cars and trucks
Zaxabock#0013: I am terrified of sinkholes
Nik#1011: if you want I can find one
Nik#1011: <@!393989648159866883> I've also seen gifs of floors collapsing
Nickproof#6817: Floor can take a lot of stress until broken.
Zaxabock#0013: Assuming the average weighs... 77kg? That's over 2 tons, moving and jumping :b
Nik#1011: regardless if their jumping is in frequency with the building or not
Nik#1011: but I'm just sayign that 30 people weigh a lot, especially when jumping
Nik#1011: that theory is about a bridge, and it's natural vibration frequency
Nickproof#6817: This actually real thing, as i know in Russian Empire there was some situation where bridges collapsed, also there was command to march asynchronous.
Nik#1011: not quite marching soldiers
Zaxabock#0013: Marching soldiers theory
Zaxabock#0013: I know the feeling üòÇ
Nik#1011: I would not be comfortable in that room at ALL
Nik#1011: you scared me nitro
Nik#1011: I thought the floor was gonna colapse with everyone jumping at the same time in a small room

daimondweter#8284: I think they freak out because they realized that they are kind of trapped in a computer simulation and because that could mean that they are not real, so they kind of try to exit it and if they do they got out / are real. (Maybe its that they are simulated and only just realized how empty everything around them is aaaaaand it might be the case that they are afraid that the computer will be turned off, because that person is done for the night. These two maybe make less sense. I think its more about them freaking out, because they find out that they are not real lol)

Nickproof#6817: <@!256359653124997120>  Akward thing?
DoctorVWA#1917: discord have retarded snowflake ids and some special stuff for every single id in the application, like your id: 256359653124997120 can be translated to when you created your account
DoctorVWA#1917: https://github.com/redpfire/discord_asm
Stefan#5422: but why like this
Nickproof#6817: Time counting?
Stefan#5422: why is this a thing
Nickproof#6817: Number of java and JS sounds like meme. But moving to other channel is good idea.
DoctorVWA#1917: (also we are in <#403343343775383552> , let's move to other channel)
DoctorVWA#1917: and probally WS stuff
DoctorVWA#1917: yes, you just need to make https request
DoctorVWA#1917: dude: see that there's a wrapper for his prefered language <[newline]> also dude: creates another wrapper
Stefan#5422: well you could just use the one discord provides cant you?
Nickproof#6817: 3 java, 4 javascript. Isnt this an overkill?
Stefan#5422: well I know i wont use dart or php
DoctorVWA#1917: https://discordapi.com/unofficial/comparison.html oh, look what I've found, nice sheets
Nickproof#6817: Unity scripting is on C# but the engine is on C++
Stefan#5422: for what
Stefan#5422: why is there a discord unity
Nickproof#6817: or HASKELL or RUBY without RAILS.
Nickproof#6817: FORTHRAN
Stefan#5422: Forte Fortissimo
Stefan#5422: FF
Nickproof#6817: BINARY or BF.
Stefan#5422: ASSAMBLER BOT
DoctorVWA#1917: all the wrappers: https://discordapi.com/unofficial/libs.html
Stefan#5422: time for some basic bots
DoctorVWA#1917: resuming: you can use discord API in every single language
Nickproof#6817: Lets return to question, how you end your loop.
cmoa#8392: yeah i know there's one for python as well
Stefan#5422: and then programm bots while the other learn what a pointer is
DoctorVWA#1917: you can as well use it purely by requests, with no wrapper
Stefan#5422: Ill read it up in my lunchbreak tomorrow sounds fun
DoctorVWA#1917: there's discord API wrappers for a lot of lnguages
Stefan#5422: didnt know that was a thing
cmoa#8392: java discord api
cmoa#8392: i'm using JDA
Stefan#5422: also how are you able to write a bot in java I thought they only supported js
Nickproof#6817: Interrupts?
cmoa#8392: i don't really know tbh XD i gess the listener i'm using does it for me but not sure
Nickproof#6817: Than how you end this loop if it is controlled outside the loop and in same thread.
cmoa#8392: well idk if this could count as multithread since there is only one
Nickproof#6817: <@!283358054827819008>  This is multithread? Or controlled by interrupts?
cmoa#8392: but if i don't use the sysout it will never stop
cmoa#8392: i'm using a variable controled externaly to stop the loop
Stefan#5422: well it will work tho
Nickproof#6817: <@!283358054827819008>  Isnt this endless or not enterable loop?
Stefan#5422: Jav
cmoa#8392: yes
Stefan#5422: ah yes java?
cmoa#8392: ok so i don't do that it doesn't work ...
Stefan#5422: how about hexcells
Zaxabock#0013: Nonogram, but I'd be interested in a Minesweeper / Sudoku Nonogram variant ü§î

Nickproof#6817: <@!119734190571913216>  Oh boy I've seen a lot of them. Also IMO.
Nik#1011: let's talk about funny things, especially since this is <#403343343775383552>
Nik#1011: <@!393989648159866883> there's no reason to state your experience with the star wars fans you've seen, especially if your experience was so negative
Nickproof#6817: Maybe.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: You are entirely missing the point
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ü§¶
Nickproof#6817: <@!229403258278510593>  I also know such people, but the ones i see at some Cons, they arent as good.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Yes, beyond the heavy handed insulting, "retarded" is a very charged word. I know several people who are on the spectrum and they are wonderful people who are just as capable.
ZephyrZ80#6195: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI

ForLoveOfCats#4111: lets avoid throwing around such heavy insults towards large groups of people just because they think a different film/tv series is better
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I have many friends who are die hard Star Wars films
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Everyone is entitled to their opinions in media
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Not cool
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Woah woah woah Nick
ZephyrZ80#6195: Nice.
Nik#1011: they cropped it for the first airing
Nik#1011: oh Deep Space Nine was actually recorded in 16:9 aspect ratio in preperation for widescreen TV
Nickproof#6817: <@!229403258278510593>  Just to remind. Most of Star Wars fans are retarded, at least ones that i saw.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Dunno if they kept the film-method for Deep Space Nine.
Nik#1011: RIP
ZephyrZ80#6195: Yeah, Voyager is stuck at 480i because it was immediately put on magnetic tape and edited that way.
Nik#1011: my dad owns all the blu rays :)
Nik#1011: fun fact, TNG was recorded on film. They re-edited the entire series in high resolution, with new CG and everything, because the film doesn't have a maximum resolution
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I personally prefer Star Trek over Wars (echo chammber yay! /s) because they are willing to slow down and think about their actions thoughtfully and carefully, weighing the pros and cons as well as examining their own morals.
Nickproof#6817: Most of Star Track aliens are humanoid, i think it caused by lack of CG
Nik#1011: oh
ZephyrZ80#6195: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILbLGNDqUxA
ZephyrZ80#6195: The Sheliak would like to disagree with you.
Nik#1011: why every single alien with a solid body has 2 legs is something I'll never know
Nickproof#6817: At least story is interesting.
Nik#1011: Star trek (I've only really seen TNG) is amazing. It's very focused on philosophical questions, and not very focused on realistic looking aliens
Nickproof#6817: Value in numbers, and some reference points to know from where to count.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Besides five episodes of Deep Space Nine.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Star Trek TNG is great, Star Trek Voyager is alright. Those are the only two I've really seen.
Nickproof#6817: So how much Star Trek is better than Star Wars (more like Star Shit at least for me).
Nik#1011: I mean sometimes they're not, idk, it's kind of a gray area.
Nik#1011: the best statements are ALWAYS binary
Nickproof#6817: That is good statement but it is binary.
ZephyrZ80#6195: Star Trek > Star Wars
Nickproof#6817: They forgot to include army of retards.

Nickproof#6817: And same for other one, best case scenario in terms of lives is not to pull the lever. Lets go to <#416276124977332226>
DoctorVWA#1917: I think it's better to us go to other channel, before things happen
DoctorVWA#1917: I just see kill 1 or possibly kill all of them, or even a better argument against aftermatch problems shall be valuate someones live more than 3 strangers
Nickproof#6817: That will not happen, but you are killing beloved one, not to mention aftermath problems with others, because on cart that you can drive is also your beloved ones.
DoctorVWA#1917: wait, if both don't trigger, both families die too?
Nickproof#6817: And same for other person. So the most possible variant is the worst case scenario.
DoctorVWA#1917: well, between killing one parent aside from killing 3 inocent civilians + possible all of my family, that's better to have 1 ded
Nickproof#6817: That is actually game theory. It is called like this, as far as i know this part called non-cooperative.
Buzz#6223: Im talking about the trolley thing
Nickproof#6817: Nope, just another representation of chaos.
Buzz#6223: (Joke ofc)
Buzz#6223: I'd do nothing for that last one <[newline]>  <[newline]> Frick family smh
Nickproof#6817: Try to do this formula and than plot it `Xn+1 = L*Xn(1-Xn)` Xn and Xn+1 are same but different iteration. You can choose L freely.
Nickproof#6817: The game theory?
Jimmy#8080: and my absolute favourite of all time

ForLoveOfCats#4111: I think you misread the image...
Nickproof#6817: Better random anime song, but if this will save a lot more people than i accept it, it will hurt a lot and i may commit to suicide branch but if this is for good i will make it as less painful as possible.
cmoa#8392: who will dare pulling the lever ??? #Shrek4Ever
Jimmy#8080: 
Nickproof#6817: Also in my opinion libertarian idea is man eating. But for bigger discussion we should begin it in either in <#416276124977332226>  or <#631004929762525204>.
Jimmy#8080: I guess it's just absurdism
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That's what was confusing me
ForLoveOfCats#4111: yeah lol
Jimmy#8080: then I'm not sure what the point of the meme is lol
Jimmy#8080: oh what
ForLoveOfCats#4111: it's what unions themselves say
ForLoveOfCats#4111: the saying is "Don't tread on me" symbolizing don't take advantage of me while working for you
Nickproof#6817: <@!154964593397989376>  Than if this conversation is meme, we should indicate place where to read, will be easier to navigate.
Jimmy#8080: educate me please
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That's not what the snake saying means
Jimmy#8080: The person pulling the lever is a libertarian. They think it's best not to tread on the snake - best not to have unions - even if it means death and suffering for many many people.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: But it also could swing the other way...
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Perhaps because the author is showing the party being made fun of here as respecting the wishes of unions that they themselves are against them?
Jimmy#8080: this whole conversation is one continuous meme
Jimmy#8080: nah it's just that we have the best memes
Nickproof#6817: I think we should change `memes` to `conversation generator using some stupid thing`.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: So it's trying to say that laissez faire economics is bad but it's packed so much in. For example the reference to the snake implies some stance on unions but I can't figure out what stance the author is taking
Jimmy#8080: The image is making fun of libertarianism. Libertarians, essentially, believe that the government should not interfere with civilians' lives.
ForLoveOfCats#4111: ok that clears up that but honestly muddies the waters even more lol
Jimmy#8080: NAP in this context means *Non-Aggression Principle*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I see the "taxes are necessary" subtext, but it's the bigger statement I feel I'm missing or misunderstanding
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I don't recognize the acronym NAP, also is that seriously taking an anti-union stance? I've very confused about what the second image is trying to say ü§î
Jimmy#8080: 
Jimmy#8080: 
Jimmy#8080: I'm particularly fond of the twistings of the trolley problem to make a political statement
Jimmy#8080: yes and it's the fucking best
ForLoveOfCats#4111: At this point you'd think I'd no longer have the, "There's a subreddit for that?" reaction. Alas. There's a subreddit for the trolley problem??
Jimmy#8080: <@119734190571913216> I did not. <https://www.reddit.com/r/trolleyproblem/comments/eof8mu/the_real_choice_is_how_you_cope_with_your_actions/>
Buzz#6223: 
Nik#1011: jimmy did you make that?
Buzz#6223: I-
Jimmy#8080: 
ZephyrZ80#6195: Yep.
Nik#1011: well, to a large extent, code never explains why it does something. even if it's easier to understand the "why" in high level languages, if it's not explicitly stated in comments, sometimes it's hard to understand why 1 implementation was chosen over another
Nik#1011: so in assembly you have to explain **why** you're doing things
Nik#1011: yeah commenting with assembly is damn near necessary, because you can't name things the same way you can in higher level languages
ZephyrZ80#6195: https://youtu.be/rpFbyW5wryI
DoctorVWA#1917: that's work for reverse enginners xd
ZephyrZ80#6195: 
ZephyrZ80#6195: I mean, try figuring out what this does without comments, and you're bound to go insane.
ZephyrZ80#6195: I comment every line of my code, because 'self-documenting assembly code' is not a thing.

DoctorVWA#1917: commenting is good for a documentation porpuse and has a pattern, also it is strongly usefull when you have obscure calculations that lead to something, something like calculate coordinates for something, based on other 5 variables, which is impossible to someone imagine what is going on with that, like `//used a method called ablaksiemoda to calculate coordinates`
Deleted User#0000: `i am going to set up a program that beeps every minute so that way i can truly understand the feeling of 8x speed`
Deleted User#0000: it feels like it's physically been 5 minutes since 43 minutes ago
Deleted User#0000: like even faster than if you're playing a game
Deleted User#0000: is it just me or does time seem to go unreasonably fast while programming
Dunda#2719: So it's unfortunate that that can break down in some situations
Dunda#2719: But preferably if you can let your code speak for itself it reflects on how well you can communicate yourself
Dunda#2719: Sometimes you have magic numbers though, which sucks
Dunda#2719: That's a solid philosophy
Jimmy#8080: As I've become a more experienced programmer I've been commenting less and less. I've now mostly adopted the philosophy that code should, by itself, explain what it does. This is accomplished mainly by using very small methods and helpful, descriptive names for variables and methods.
Deleted User#0000: 
Deleted User#0000: also i may be overusing `const`
Deleted User#0000: i never learned how to properly comment and now i am actually needing to do it and i am kind of lost xd
Dunda#2719: probably more unreadable than bare code at this point
Dunda#2719: I did that for way too long
Jimmy#8080: yes
Dunda#2719: back in the stage where you commented every line perhaps?
Dunda#2719: Ah
Jimmy#8080: I found comments like this extremely useful while I was learning to program
Nik#1011: I never even thuoght of that
Nik#1011: commenting your comments hahahahah
Dunda#2719: `//class def //comment for class def`
Nik#1011: `def function(data)  //defining function that takes data`

DoctorVWA#1917: that kinda of client just thinks that you read minds tho
DoctorVWA#1917: "hey, I want a website, can you make it?" - "yes, what is the website about? what I put on it?" - "yes."
Zaxabock#0013: But it can also be annoying when the client knows EXACTLY what they want and no matter what you do, it doesn't match up with what they had imagined
DoctorVWA#1917: the client have no idea of he wants xd

Zaxabock#0013: "I want users to be able to comment, make something like that"
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I can imagine that being infuriating, the closest I've experienced is not getting concrete goals for what they want the darn thing to look like and what content to have on it
Zaxabock#0013: Multiple client representatives with differing goals, for example, they ask for one thing and when you deliver it's all like "Wuts dis, I didant ask fur dis"

ForLoveOfCats#4111: Incorrect <[newline]> Mono has first class support for all major platforms, recently became supported by Microsoft, and has mature GTK+ bindings to the point where several Gnome apps are built in C#. Also there are numerious game engines with cross platform support that use C# most notably Unity and Godot. C# is not a wonderous language but as someone who writes C# on Linux on a daily basis I felt I had to correct this literal meme (I acknowledge how silly it is to correct a meme lol)

Buzz#6223: in order to create a jimmy you must also create an antijimmy
Deleted User#0000: but this machine is the only source / destroyer of jimmies
Deleted User#0000: the law of conservation of jimmy states that jimmies cannot be created nor destroyed
Dunda#2719: That would make me very happy
Dunda#2719: can you fill the background with a giant jimmy head

Jimmy#8080: Oh I am absolutely anti-fascism. And I recognize that there are people on the political left who are unreasonably exclusionary and hostile. I just find it interesting that the derogatory term for this class of people is a compliment if you analyze what it actually means.
Deleted User#0000: T-5:00
Nickproof#6817: And in five minutes there will be chaos here.
Nickproof#6817: Yep "Mein Kampf".
DoctorVWA#1917: for worse than this, there's actual people that use it and write like that :(, very sad, but it is still a meme between brazillian guys
Deleted User#0000: i thought?
Deleted User#0000: Mein*
Nickproof#6817: <@!154964593397989376>  Just watch what they do, and than read what fascist done (in Ukraine you can buy books written by them, even "Main Kapmf") and you will see similarity.
Zaxabock#0013: <@!393989648159866883> Took me some time to find it, but it got me thinking about this old video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji7Koeqlgeg
DoctorVWA#1917: in portuguese we have like two flex of the same word, the feminine and the masculine version, like in "bruxa" ou have "bruxo", both stands for witch, some random retarded piece of shit decided that everyone NEED to use the language to support people with unefined genres and don't generalize using the masculine version of it, so it would be "bruxx"
Jimmy#8080: I find it interesting that "Social Justice Warrior" is used derogatively. Social Justice is a good thing, surely? And those who fight for it are surely noble in doing so.
Nickproof#6817: Sorry for bad jokes.
Nickproof#6817: More like diarrhea queen.
Deleted User#0000: to take down dairy queen
Deleted User#0000: us men must band together
Nickproof#6817: Lets not bring them (fascist SJW) here.

Zaxabock#0013: It got a complete overhaul
Zaxabock#0013: Have you tried the new Blender, Nik?
Nik#1011: blender is not a good UI
Deleted User#0000: there is no need
Deleted User#0000: why am i judging a meme
Deleted User#0000: @ blender
Deleted User#0000: "Explain it to a professional in the field of what the user interface is design for" is more accurate
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  Or "Welcome to TCL"
Deleted User#0000: i disagree
Zaxabock#0013: 
Nickproof#6817: I think in basic library there can be operator override for this.
Deleted User#0000: comparing `String`s with == be like

DoctorVWA#1917: all or the majority
ZephyrZ80#6195:

Deleted User#0000: what
Deleted User#0000: `middle air?`
DoctorVWA#1917: yes, the trees fluctuate in middle air
Deleted User#0000: do the trees come with fans that aren't even remotely close to the motherboard so they cool as little as possible and sometimes aren't even plugged into the board?
Jimmy#8080: here's a meme about the Baltimore accent
DoctorVWA#1917: there's like 999999$ for a tree view more 999999999$ for actually being able to have one
DoctorVWA#1917: apple just bought nature, you need to pay to see it
Deleted User#0000: rest in peace, nature
Deleted User#0000: that's like when you google apple and it shows apple's website
DoctorVWA#1917: here's a """"meme""""" about cactus
ZephyrZ80#6195: I don't think I'm capable of proper pet ownership, but that doesn't mean I can't volunteer at an animal shelter to play with the cats.
Nickproof#6817: <@!154964593397989376>  Sometimes stupid thing make people discuss "meaning of life" sized questions
Zaxabock#0013: Memei we should mosey along to the <#631004929762525204>
Deleted User#0000: 10/10 meme
Nickproof#6817: That is what i said.
DoctorVWA#1917: <@!378755500021645315> that's not something to you worry about if you pet a cactus, even you forget to water it, it can survive a lot of time
Jimmy#8080: these are some great <#403343343775383552> you guys
Deleted User#0000: "killing them is sometimes the second best option, the best being not getting one in the first place" <[newline]> (paraphrased)
Deleted User#0000: this is why nick said
Deleted User#0000: nitro
Zaxabock#0013: Just like the discussion we did about children
Zaxabock#0013: By getting a pet you are not ready for and not having a ways to getting it to a better home, you are effectively dooming them, I think
Nickproof#6817: Also vets arent cheap here.
Deleted User#0000: "opting" i guess would be a better word
Nickproof#6817: There are a lot of homeless pets, this causes problems.
Deleted User#0000: that's not the right word
Deleted User#0000: i say "wanting"
Deleted User#0000: well
Stenodyon#8192: :(
Deleted User#0000: if traumatic stuff happening to animals is common where you live then i can understand wanting to just kill your cat if it's causing too many problems with you
Zaxabock#0013: I reacted to this because we don't have a vet here and many people who are tired of their pets just shoot them up here, we live out in the sticks and there's not much social damage for doing so, and it's very sad for me
Nickproof#6817: Sometimes yes, at least where i live.
Deleted User#0000: i can see why someone could think that nvm
Deleted User#0000: wait
Deleted User#0000: giving it away isn't a better option than just killing it?
Deleted User#0000: h a e h
Nickproof#6817: <@!378755500021645315>  Sometimes that is the best option, just after not getting pets.
Nickproof#6817: Pallas's cat name in russian is "–º–∞–Ω—É–ª"  which sounds like "manul", so if you pet manul you will die like casul.
Zaxabock#0013: Or "pets" specifically
Zaxabock#0013: But I don't condone killing animals Nick :c
Deleted User#0000: but 99% of cats will be like "maybe i will fuck you up who knows"
Deleted User#0000: you can research whether that specific cactus will cause pain
Nickproof#6817: Just pet Pallas's cat.
Deleted User#0000: thing is
Zaxabock#0013: That is a nifty little thing
Zaxabock#0013: Mexican peyote cactus
Deleted User#0000: thank you

Zaxabock#0013: **pets the cactus**
Deleted User#0000: when has a cactus hurt anybody
Deleted User#0000: get a cactus
Nickproof#6817: Or just kill them. And the best idea is not to get cats as pets, same for dogs etc.
Deleted User#0000: that'll teach 'em

Nickproof#6817: And because im "soulless" i would not forgive them.
Zaxabock#0013: They often like to pretend I'm a pin cushion but I forgive them, but I do get mad if they suddenly pounce on my keyboard for attention and it screws up some of my work üòÇ
Nickproof#6817: They create only problems, at least for me.

Glitch#9081: petition to call next Logic world thursday "Logic World Thursday the IV, king of the missed Wednesdays"
Witness#6597: I already understood it right away :-)
Jimmy#8080: To be clear, I *was* joking; "LWW" does not stand for "Logic World Wheneveriwant"
Jimmy#8080: We just haven't gotten around to it. There are other more important features to work on first.
Witness#6597: Why you can't make the title editing function? This is my last question.
Jimmy#8080: <@128545421579517952> can talk more about the tech behind it if you have questions
Jimmy#8080: we would like to open source it eventually
Jimmy#8080: that uses the ASP.NET framework, but other than that logicworld.net is a totally original codebase
Jimmy#8080: ah
Witness#6597: I'm talking about the site
Jimmy#8080: Logic World is made with Unity
Witness#6597: you use a ready-made engine?
Jimmy#8080: logicworld.net doesn't let you edit titles so I can't fix them, sorry :/
Jimmy#8080: typos

Nik#1011: what's a VN
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: do you think it‚Äôs a bad idea to try and make a program that will parse renpy vn‚Äôs and turn em into cpp vn‚Äôs?
Nik#1011: it automatically detects .py files and knows what to do though, so it works prettyw ell
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: speaking of script interpreters
Nik#1011: or in this case, a script interpreter

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: to be fair the guy does want to help you when you ask him
Nik#1011: I feel bad for my boss, too. there genuinely was a lot to explain, he had lots of patience.
Nik#1011: no concentration effort available for the rest of the day
Nik#1011: I remember when I was getting trained for my first job (6 hours a day for 5 days) I felt like that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: because unlike listening to him, this won‚Äôt take all my concentration away, leaving none for the rest of the day
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: this is a better use of time than listening to the geography teacher talk for 80 min straight

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or actually
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: my brain thinking of optimizations at 2am vs my actual code
Jimmy#8080: it's not compression, it's obfuscation
Nik#1011: what a useless compression algorithm. invents shorthand, then doesn't use it.
Nik#1011: it wasn't even on purpose that I said "hereby denoted as X" and then I never said X after that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ^
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ye
Jimmy#8080: someone give this man a nobel prize
Nik#1011: "u ain't wrong"
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: to summarize
Nik#1011: currently in the present time of this existence of the universe, the complex self-interacting collection of matter that is currently uttering this sentence (hereby denoted as "I" or "myself"), is having a conscious and purposeful thought. A thought of realization that the idea formulated by reading that piece of language on his digital image replication device is likely not disprovable.
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: using that unironically would make you seem only half as smart though
Nik#1011: I love it
Nik#1011: YES
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or something
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: ‚Äúi am in the understanding that the statement you just uttered is theoretically impossible to prove false‚Äù
Nik#1011: I think it means: I don't think somebody can prove that statement is wrong
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you just said
Nik#1011: good luck understanding that sentence. cuz I don't even know what I just said
Nik#1011: I don't believe that to be entirely unprovable
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it‚Äôs fun that you can make yourself sound twice as smart just by forming your sentence slightly differently
Nik#1011: you can help figure this out
Nik#1011: but you're smart
Nik#1011: :(
TebiByte#1393: No
Jimmy#8080: one the one hand, I appreciate the beautiful complexity English now has after thousands of years of emergent evolution. On the other hand, god is it garbage in so many ways, can we please just tear it down and start fresh already
Nik#1011: <@271378293339586565> I randomly choose you to explain this stupidity
Nik#1011: they're quite oposite
Nik#1011: 1: you're going to do something inconsistent compared to your normal behavior <[newline]> 2: you're physically mixing something, to remove the inconsistencies
Nik#1011: when you say "I'm going to mix it up", that means 1 of 2 things
Nik#1011: man english is fucking stupid
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: yes
Nik#1011: *clicks purchase
Nik#1011: *knock knock knock*
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: negative delivery time
Nik#1011: ehh your idea is better
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: and ship it there before the persone even thinks of buying it
Nik#1011: and have hours of training to retrieve any item within 30 seconds
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: and then we can simulate when someone is going to buy something
Nik#1011: they just have a huge van filled with all the most purchased items from amazon.com or something like that
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: we figure out how the brain works
Nik#1011: to offset the cost of employment, "shipping" costs would be quite exorbitant. but it would only take like 10 minutes
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: how about
Nik#1011: employ millions of people to stand at every small collection of homes
Nik#1011: I got a great idea. instant delivery.

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: or rather, compiling one to compile the other
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: compiling two things at the same time

Nik#1011: yes. if the assembly code says one thing, print another thing
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it‚Äôs an assembler

Buzz#6223: yea
Nik#1011: he started talking about that right after saying he might've gotten poison ivy on his skin, so I figured he meant like literally cleaning himself
Buzz#6223: like physically he got clean but still felt dirty
Nik#1011: oh I see
Buzz#6223: idk how to say it
Buzz#6223: he couldnt get "clean" in the sense that he felt ethically dirty or like
Buzz#6223: also he means like
Buzz#6223: well obv he didnt actually get raped by a sasquatch
Nik#1011: dude got raped and is complaining that he felt like he couldn't clean himself in the bath at home afterwards
Buzz#6223: lmao
Nik#1011: lmao thanks for sharing, this dude is telling this story like this sasquatch is just his irritating wife
Nik#1011: I'm thoroughly surprised by this story though. Not only did he locate a creature believed to have never existed, but he brought himself to an orgasm while interacting with the creature
Buzz#6223: that was my 2nd time watching the whole thing
Buzz#6223: lol
Nik#1011: "I wasn't just raped by a dragon, I was raped by a dragon with a vagina!"

Nik#1011: that's the main reason I don't like dating sites too much for my own searching, it's too focused on the relationship part and not as much on the being friends part
Nik#1011: everyone I had a relationship started out as just a friendship, I intend to keep it that way because I don't want to date someone that I wouldn't be friends with
FacePox#2708: Focus on your friends
FacePox#2708: Girls give you nothing but trouble

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: some people deposited 2k and then used that 2k as colatieral for margin, then used that margin to buy stocks, then sold covered calls against those stocks
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: which allowed you to leverage yourself infinitely

Buzz#6223: listen here ya little shit <[newline]>  <[newline]> i was *10*
Nik#1011: lolz
Nik#1011: even without knowing about functions to turn strings into lowercase, you could check each letter individually for capital or lower
Buzz#6223: of course (or you could do it with lowercase), but i was new to coding lol
ZephyrZ80#6195: ü§î Couldn't you just keep a capitalized reference word and force the input string to capitals?
Buzz#6223: Me in elementary school trying to figure out how to check for all capitalizations of a word be like: <[newline]> ```py <[newline]> if IN in [ <[newline]> ayyyy, <[newline]> Ayyyy, <[newline]> aYyyy, <[newline]> AYyyy, <[newline]> ayYyy, <[newline]> AyYyy, <[newline]> aYYyy, <[newline]> AYYyy, <[newline]> ayyYy, <[newline]> AyyYy, <[newline]> aYyYy, <[newline]> AYyYy, <[newline]> ayYYy, <[newline]> AyYYy, <[newline]> aYYYy, <[newline]> AYYYy, <[newline]> ayyyY, <[newline]> AyyyY, <[newline]> aYyyY, <[newline]> AYyyY, <[newline]> ayYyY, <[newline]> AyYyY, <[newline]> aYYyY, <[newline]> AYYyY, <[newline]> ayyYY, <[newline]> AyyYY, <[newline]> aYyYY, <[newline]> AYyYY, <[newline]> ayYYY, <[newline]> AyYYY, <[newline]> aYYYY, <[newline]> AYYYY]: <[newline]>     print("idk im just makin up code at this point") <[newline]> ```
ZephyrZ80#6195: You can get HCT chips (though more expensive) that can accept TTL levels for their inputs with the minimal input current of CMOS, and output CMOS levels with the current capacity of TTL chips.
ZephyrZ80#6195: CMOS has a higher '1' voltage threshold for its input, but its inputs take almost 0 current. <[newline]> TTL has a lower '1' voltage threshold for its input, but its inputs take quite a bit of current.
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: yeah its just different voltage levels for 1s
Buzz#6223: lol
Buzz#6223: i think...
Buzz#6223: they use different voltages/currents
Nik#1011: I don't get cmos vs TTL though
Nik#1011: oh I understand
Buzz#6223: lol
Buzz#6223: like a lil binary amp
Buzz#6223: it can convert the signals to other types of logic (like CMOS to TTL), or it can make the signal able to go to more chips
Buzz#6223: but in reality
Buzz#6223: in simulation its useless
Buzz#6223: not really
Nik#1011: so the world's most useless real gate?
Nik#1011: oh
Buzz#6223: it takes a logic signal on the input, and outputs it on... the output...
Nik#1011: what's a buffer
Buzz#6223: this is a diode
Buzz#6223: they act differently
Buzz#6223: thats not the symbol for a diode
bluzi‚Ñ¢#4441: diode? lol
Buzz#6223: why not just show it as a buffer? or not there because there's an inverting buffer on the other end
Buzz#6223: like
Buzz#6223: its just a normal-ass buffer if it has a dot on both ends
Nik#1011: almost as useful as the xand gate
Nik#1011: a Nnot gate?
Nik#1011: what's a not gate with an extra dot at the start?
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: is it an output buffer ?

ForLoveOfCats#4111: I've never experienced any of these issues and I have 77 hours in it lol
Nik#1011: it's very flickery
Nik#1011: and if you're changing the "UI SCALE" slider, the UI will scale, and so the slider moves, and therefore slides back to 100%
ForLoveOfCats#4111: Ouch <[newline]>  <[newline]> Waaa, I've never had that happen that I can remember
Nik#1011: anyway if you're in the menus and you're spotted and killed, it takes you out of the menus
Nik#1011: not the case for me
ForLoveOfCats#4111: if you're active in the menus it shouldn't kick you, I've personally not experienced it myself at least
Nik#1011: so that was annoying
Nik#1011: there were other dumb things. you can't change the settings unless you're in a game, and if you're in a game and afk you get kicked
ForLoveOfCats#4111: thankfully it only affects the scoreboard
ForLoveOfCats#4111: yeah it's dumb
Nik#1011: but enemy also red
Nik#1011: team 2 is red
Nik#1011: team "2" is down 60 points
Nik#1011: I made a mistake
Nik#1011: ohhhh
Nik#1011: I don't get it
ForLoveOfCats#4111: so if you're on red.... have fun reading the scoreboard lol
ForLoveOfCats#4111: I find it annoying that Krunker has the teams be red and blue as no matter which team you are on the enemies are always red
Nik#1011: that's enough FPS for me
Nik#1011: yee red team was down 60 points
ForLoveOfCats#4111: hardpoint is judged on the team's overall objective points
ForLoveOfCats#4111: That was a close round
Nik#1011: (and also the highest deaths but let's not pay attention to that)
Nik#1011: rip, got defeated despite having the highest kills, highest assists, and highest score

Nik#1011: but then it started seeming like emptying the truck was somehow going to take even longer. It was already 7pm, I was completely exhausted, and now I'm renting the van for longer than the 6 hour window that I scheduled. So that's awesome.
Nik#1011: so I stopped by McDonald's on the way to the new apartment, just to refuel myself after that torture
Nik#1011: started filling it up, that was fucking horrible. took 3 hours!
Nik#1011: it was a pretty busy day, I got lunch, then picked up the van at 2pm, drove to my old apartment.

Nik#1011: oh yeah because my credit card expired, I lost my discord nitro legacy. Started buying nitro again like 2 days after the failed payment, and never got nitro legacy again :(

Nik#1011: <@!427964757492891649> lol responding to your joke about noose tying videos on youtube. I was genuinely learning how to tie all sorts of knots and I remembered how weird nooses look, so I went on youtube, and laughed at all the meme comments for like half an hour
ZephyrZ80#6195: Oh, thanks.

Buzz#6223: It may be too complex for the average user to understand, but that's ok
Buzz#6223: 
Buzz#6223: So guys, you know about voltage controlled oscillators, digitally controlled oscillators, ect... but I looked online, and i couldn't find a single frequency controlled oscillator. So, i got to work thinking, how could one possibly design a circuit so complex that it takes an input frequency, and bases the oscillation on the output off of that <:bobby_thinking:628675106008465448>? After hours of drawing diagrams and performing complex boolean algebra equations, I figured out how i could create such a circuit. My final, revolutionary idea, that will win me several Nobel prizes, is as follows:

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: that‚Äôs pretty fast
Buzz#6223: lol
Buzz#6223: done did
Buzz#6223: and then
Buzz#6223: devided by 16
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if you know what i mean
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: but with 2hz updates
Buzz#6223: its going to be running at 3.6 MHz
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: nah i don‚Äôt mean actual 2hz
Buzz#6223: no
Buzz#6223: i accidently got the sound chip that's used in the computer in my PFP
TebiByte#1393: Yeah it's so great you can't even hear it!
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: actually all the decoding and stuff would make it... 0,5 hz at max
TebiByte#1393: A whole 2 Hz?
Buzz#6223: lmao
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: 2hz audio must sound amazing
Buzz#6223: idk
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: when will it have a sound chip?
TebiByte#1393: Wow that's a fast clock speed
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: also
Buzz#6223: lol
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: oh okay
Buzz#6223: the clock speed is like 2 Hz
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: if so just yeet the clock speed down
Buzz#6223: wdym
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you got a persistent memory z80 in that thing or not?
TebiByte#1393: Eh I don't usually worry too much about compile times.
Buzz#6223: oh jesus christ i dont even know what it's doing
Buzz#6223: yea i dont know about all that...
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: you‚Äôre getting closer tho
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: sad
Buzz#6223: it messed up
Buzz#6223: no i was right
Buzz#6223: oh
Buzz#6223: holy shoot
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: how to speed up compiling: buy a better pc
TebiByte#1393: I rarely do compile-time optimizations
Buzz#6223: i think its just backwards
Buzz#6223: maybe not
Buzz#6223: oh wait
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: it‚Äôs doing *something*, that‚Äôs already a step ahead of mine
Buzz#6223: ayyyy i was right
Buzz#6223: im just sitting back and about to watch my computer fail
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: unity shall submit one day
Buzz#6223: oof
Jimmy#8080: I'm beating unity into submission with some compile time optimizations I've been working on. It is taking significantly longer than expected
TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: cuz perpetual energy?
Buzz#6223: this is why LW delayed

TBS-Frain_Breeze#0771: great naming
TebiByte#1393: Thicc capacitor
TebiByte#1393: Lmao
Buzz#6223: weird
Buzz#6223: ig my power supply had a thicc capacitor in it or something
Buzz#6223: oh i unplugged the thing
TebiByte#1393: You're not supplying power to it at all? Like it's unplugged
Buzz#6223: but EVERYTHING is off
TebiByte#1393: You're probably shorting something
TebiByte#1393: Lol
Buzz#6223: i've created perpetual energy
Buzz#6223: ok now everything is actually off and its still happening
Buzz#6223: still dont know what path the current was taking through my body tho
Buzz#6223: oh wait nvm
Buzz#6223: im touching these wires on my breadboards connected to leds and the leds are turning on. everything is off.
TebiByte#1393: No, this reality
Buzz#6223: :0
Jimmy#8080: figured it out: program a simulated reality in which magnetic monopoles can exist
Buzz#6223: send half of a full magnetic field through a quantum tunnel
TebiByte#1393: Good luck lol
Jimmy#8080: 
Jimmy#8080: pinning this so I'll remember it when I figure it out
TebiByte#1393: If someone figures out how to create a magnetic monopole, I will eat a hat.
TebiByte#1393: Maxwells equations haven't lied to us yet
Jimmy#8080: *under known physics
TebiByte#1393: They're not physically possible
Jimmy#8080: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole
TebiByte#1393: Uhhh I don't think that magnetic monopoles are a thing, man
TebiByte#1393: Dude if I could create eddy currents with my mind, i might never need to charge my phone lol
Jimmy#8080: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_current
TebiByte#1393: Ahhh I don't think magnetic current is a thing
Buzz#6223: yall are weird everyone can do that
Buzz#6223: yall tryna tell me you cant create eddy currents with your mind?!
Jimmy#8080: electromagnetic fields, like those that are generated by an electromagnet
TebiByte#1393: I mean... Everyone can sense electric current.... Idk what electromagnetic current is though lol
Jimmy#8080: lol
Buzz#6223: oh god
Buzz#6223: oh shit i wasnt supposed to tell anyone
Jimmy#8080: yes you do because you can't
TebiByte#1393: If you can see it
Buzz#6223: i dont know what it's like not being able to sense electromagnetic currents
TebiByte#1393: Or
Stenodyon#8192: <@!427964757492891649> Just close your eyes
TebiByte#1393: Buzz, tell me what is behind you without turning your head?
Jimmy#8080: <@!427964757492891649> what is it like not to be able to sense electromagnetic fields? That's what being blind is like but for photons
Stenodyon#8192: me too
Jimmy#8080: Can't wait for BMIs to settle this debate once and for all lol
Buzz#6223: man, what is being blind like
TebiByte#1393: Most of us, no matter how perceive it, have an idea of color. Unless you're blind
TebiByte#1393: SOOO thats a really good question. "Is color the same for everyone?"
Buzz#6223: i would love to temporarily have synesthesia
Stenodyon#8192: I would like to hear it
Buzz#6223: is color the same for everyone?
TebiByte#1393: I have an intuitive idea, but I can't quite grasp how to articulate it. I remember thinking about it a lot when I was looking at how colorblindness works
Buzz#6223: yes
TebiByte#1393: That's a big question
Buzz#6223: like i do
Buzz#6223: how can i experience things
Buzz#6223: like
Buzz#6223: ok tell me how the frick frack chemical reactions leads to c o n s c i o u s n e s s
Stenodyon#8192: I really don't believe in dualism at all
TebiByte#1393: Eh death is a part of life
Buzz#6223: no
TebiByte#1393: Unless you believe that the mind and brain are separate things
Buzz#6223: lol
Buzz#6223: death kinda sucks tbh
TebiByte#1393: Because I will still be around after I die, but I just won't be alive
Stenodyon#8192: I don't think you can experience nothing
Buzz#6223: when we forget things, is it the same as being dead, or experiencing nothing?
Buzz#6223: we've all already experienced nothing
Jimmy#8080: I assume so
Buzz#6223: is before birth the same as after death?
TebiByte#1393: That depends on what you mean by existence
Stenodyon#8192: But when you die can you still speak about "you"? Don't you disappear from existence appart from the memory of your peers and the traces you've left on the world?
TebiByte#1393: No you don't have a mind to remember anything lol
Stenodyon#8192: That's what I was thinking, it changes what nothing is *according to you*
Buzz#6223: lmao
Buzz#6223: the only thing you are contemplating is nothing, but then are you not therefore contemplating something?
TebiByte#1393: I don't think it does change. You cant experience "nothing"
Jimmy#8080: i.e. nothing
Jimmy#8080: if you no longer have a mind to contemplate anything, you de facto are not contemplating anything
Buzz#6223: nothing is a thing
Buzz#6223: when you're alive, nothing is something
Buzz#6223: because
Stenodyon#8192: why does dying change what nothing is?
Buzz#6223: yes
TebiByte#1393: And besides, nothing doesn't make sense. Not even in a physical sense of a pure vacuum
Buzz#6223: LOL
Buzz#6223: its just nothing
Jimmy#8080: this is stupid
Buzz#6223: because when you die nothing isnt "nothing"
Buzz#6223: which is why there is no nothing until you die
Buzz#6223: yes
TebiByte#1393: Because then it becomes something
Buzz#6223: exactly
Buzz#6223: exactly
TebiByte#1393: Is nothing TRULY nothing if you give it a name?
Buzz#6223: i crave the wisdom nuggets
Stenodyon#8192: yay
Buzz#6223: *** <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]> ***
FacePox#2708: With more wisdom nuggets
Buzz#6223: just
Buzz#6223: absolutley *nothing*
FacePox#2708: I'll be back
TebiByte#1393: Lol
FacePox#2708: Aight imma head out
TebiByte#1393: Ehhhhh define nothing
Buzz#6223: until you die
Buzz#6223: everything is always something
Buzz#6223: think about it
Buzz#6223: Isn't it interesting how you can't comprehend nothing until you die?
TebiByte#1393: I forget, is this an example of optimistic nilihism?
FacePox#2708: Be an √úbermensch
Buzz#6223: i have been enlightened <[newline]> i am now a god of philosophy <[newline]> i see that past, the present, and the future <[newline]> i see all things and nothing
FacePox#2708: Nietzsche called he who can create his own reality the √úbermensch
Buzz#6223: hm
FacePox#2708: Create your own meaning
FacePox#2708: You give reality it's own meaning
Buzz#6223: ig death kinda sucks
FacePox#2708: It disgusts you
Buzz#6223: i guess somewhat
FacePox#2708: You don't want to kill someone
FacePox#2708: Clearly
FacePox#2708: But death matters to you
Buzz#6223: lmao
FacePox#2708: My man
Buzz#6223: but things dont matter
FacePox#2708: Thank you jimmy
Jimmy#8080: you can **choose** to care about death. You can **decide** that things **do** matter. That is the beauty of being a conscious mind.
FacePox#2708: The human mind craves meaning in a meaningless world. The coexistence of these things creates the absurd.
Buzz#6223: exactly
TebiByte#1393: Eh, it's pretty much hard-wired into us to not die
Buzz#6223: heck
Buzz#6223: heck
Buzz#6223: heck
Buzz#6223: heck
Buzz#6223: fine
Buzz#6223: ok
Buzz#6223: i mean
Buzz#6223: yes but its not
FacePox#2708: That, my friend, is the absurd
FacePox#2708: Do you see the contradiction
Buzz#6223: as a human being i dont want to die but at the same time there is not a single thing that matters
Buzz#6223: i dont understand what all the different terms mean but ok
FacePox#2708: Anyway, back to shitposting on 4chan for 3 more hours
FacePox#2708: What can I say?
FacePox#2708: Absurdism
FacePox#2708: Simply admit that you assign morality to certain things despite it not being intrinsic to the universe and you will no longer be contradictory
Buzz#6223: i mean
Buzz#6223: because i dont like death but also its going to happen so who cares?
Buzz#6223: =how
FacePox#2708: You are contradicting yourself
Buzz#6223: there is not a single thing that could ever happen that matters
Buzz#6223: literally nothing matters
FacePox#2708: Cool
FacePox#2708: Ok
Buzz#6223: you get born, you do some cool stuff for a bit, and then youre in a dirty-ass box, then you just instantly become one with everything else when the universe colapses in on it's self
Stenodyon#8192: That was a recent and shocking revelation to me, morality is not universal
TebiByte#1393: Also yes Jimmy I agree lol
FacePox#2708: You can't be a nihilist
TebiByte#1393: Modern day Socrates in here is asking the right questions
FacePox#2708: Morality is a human concept
Jimmy#8080: god this server is awesome
FacePox#2708: Death is amoral
FacePox#2708: Why are you passing a moral judgement on death
Buzz#6223: its like
Buzz#6223: theres *nothing*
FacePox#2708: Why does it suck
Buzz#6223: it sucks
Buzz#6223: because
Buzz#6223: that shit inevitable
FacePox#2708: Why
Buzz#6223: but at the same time
Buzz#6223: i do not like death
Buzz#6223: i personally probobally could not bring myself to kill someone, unless doing so meant my survival
FacePox#2708: >obviously yes <[newline]> That's not very existential of you
Buzz#6223: obviously yes but at the same time *im going to die at some point so what does it matter?*
TebiByte#1393: That's an interesting combination. Why not opt for optimistic nihilism? Lol
FacePox#2708: Do you believe that killing is wrong
Buzz#6223: im an existential nihilist then?
FacePox#2708: Many
Stenodyon#8192: Ah what I said seems to be existential nihilism, so it seems there are several flavors
Buzz#6223: wrfds
Buzz#6223: thats now
Buzz#6223: what
FacePox#2708: Nothing about it makes it intrinsically a fork
FacePox#2708: A fork exists before we define it as a fork
FacePox#2708: Existentialism is the belief that existence precedes essence
FacePox#2708: Kinda
Buzz#6223: i thought that was nihilism
TebiByte#1393: Fun stuff.
Stenodyon#8192: That's existentialism?
TebiByte#1393: Philosophy?
FacePox#2708: You are an existentialist
Buzz#6223: oh
FacePox#2708: No
FacePox#2708: Also untrue
Buzz#6223: im nihilistic
Stenodyon#8192: nihilism is the idea that you don't have a purpose so why bother doing anything
Buzz#6223: what is that called
Buzz#6223: what is that
Buzz#6223: because imo litterally nothing we do matters because we are going to fucking die and then thats it
FacePox#2708: It is only something to strive for
Buzz#6223: what is it
Buzz#6223: Now this is epic
FacePox#2708: An impossible ideology
Buzz#6223: whaT
FacePox#2708: It doesn't exist
Buzz#6223: explain to me
Buzz#6223: what is nihilism
Jimmy#8080: I have not studied nearly as much philosophy as I would like to üòÑ forgive me
FacePox#2708: And you don't
Buzz#6223: i am nihilistic
Buzz#6223: if i understand nihilism correctly
FacePox#2708: Bruh
FacePox#2708: Bruh
FacePox#2708: Bruh
Jimmy#8080: ah shite <@!322937301846196224> got it fucked up with nihilism
Buzz#6223: i see myself as nihilistic
Stenodyon#8192: I am deeply aware of my flaws and I'm a perfectionnist
FacePox#2708: That's what absurdism is...
Jimmy#8080: I reject absurdism. I *choose* to find meaning and purpose in this fundamentally meaningless and purposeless existence
FacePox#2708: Not kidding
FacePox#2708: Absurdism got me over my depression
FacePox#2708: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism <[newline]>  <[newline]> Tame the absurd pill. <[newline]> Albert Camus was a genius
Jimmy#8080: Could you elaborate on why you feel that way <@138380569573720065> ?
Buzz#6223: oh well ig ill have to keep building my computer smh
Buzz#6223: oops
Buzz#6223: oh wait its midnight
Stenodyon#8192: This but unironically
Buzz#6223: the world would be much better with more of you in it üò≥  <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]> /s
Stenodyon#8192: That's funny, I have the exact opposite opinion of myself
Jimmy#8080: I quite like myself, I think the world would be better with more of me in it, vain as that sounds. Plus I'd love to hang out with a me, especially a me that has had years/decades/centuries/millenia to diverge from our point of divergence
Buzz#6223: it fuckin better
Buzz#6223: i hope unity supports consciousness uploading
Stenodyon#8192: Personally I don't want more than 1 me at any time
Buzz#6223: not gonna lie
Buzz#6223: i want my mind uploaded to logic world
FacePox#2708: Existence precedes essence
Jimmy#8080: When brain uploading becomes practical I plan to have, like, dozens of digital Jimmies running around in addition to this biological one
FacePox#2708: It's all completely arbitrary how you define these things
Buzz#6223: -not
Buzz#6223: -my brain
Buzz#6223: "oh shit he fell asleep, allow me to stop moving/breathing completley and not dream"
FacePox#2708: You are all missing the point
Stenodyon#8192: just like the mv command
Stenodyon#8192: In the very specific case of making a copy and deleting the original, I would consider the new entity as me as well
Buzz#6223: your brain doesnt stop when you fall asleep!
Jimmy#8080: why not? That instance of the information stops experiencing conciousness
Buzz#6223: no
FacePox#2708: And came to the conclusion that assigning any intrinsic value to anything is pointless but we kinda have to to deal with the absurd
Jimmy#8080: Does that instance not end when you, say, go to sleep then?
Buzz#6223: me is not information, me is this instance of said information
Stenodyon#8192: I pondered that as well
Buzz#6223: "me" is me
FacePox#2708: I pondered that
Jimmy#8080: It depends how you define "you". I've pondered this a great deal, and for now I've decided that "me" is purely information. And an entity has every right to claim it is "me" whether that information is encoded in neurons, bytes of computer RAM, or stone tablets that someone manually does math on to simulate a conciousness
Buzz#6223: forever
Buzz#6223: but then you a fuckin slave
Buzz#6223: you thought you were you
Buzz#6223: imagine being the AI version
Buzz#6223: it's like the black mirror episode where you can upload yourself into a smart home
FacePox#2708: So it doesn't matter
FacePox#2708: And you can't disprove it either
Stenodyon#8192: Buzz is right IMO
FacePox#2708: You can't
FacePox#2708: Prove it
Buzz#6223: the replica of you will think it's you, but you dont actually benefit from that
FacePox#2708: There is no answer to that question
FacePox#2708: Just stop
FacePox#2708: Stop
Buzz#6223: just a replica of you
Buzz#6223: but it wont be the same you <:thonking:432741465844875264>
Jimmy#8080: Fuck yeah sign me up for that
Stenodyon#8192: I've just been hoping really hard that I can upload my consciousness to a computer at some point and live forever as a virtual entity
Stenodyon#8192: Ah you're more informed that I am üòÑ
Jimmy#8080: (using <#403343343775383552> because there's another conversation going on in <#416276124977332226>)
Jimmy#8080: <@138380569573720065> yeah I follow longevity research very closely (and donate to longevity nonprofits when I can) because I really really don't want to die. If aging isn't cured by the end of my natural lifespan, I will attempt to cheat death via cryonics. I think my odds of living for more than 200 years are >50%

Nik#1011: 
Buzz#6223: 
WAUthethird#4977: austin says "this guy" or "this little guy" when referring to *any* electronic device <[newline]>  <[newline]> he says it <[newline]> all the time <[newline]> incessantly <[newline]>  <[newline]> I want him to stop
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: if this doesnt sum up the differences between austin and linus idk what does
Nano#8786: Smexy
Nik#1011: 
Nik#1011: now you're gonna get ads for crazy sketchy things... like osha hazards and... and... outfits that look bad
Nik#1011: lmao well so much for being private, now we know you do sketchy things sometimes!
Buzz#6223: Yea
FacePox#2708: I only use tor if I wanna do something sketchy
FacePox#2708: 4chan bans posting from tor and most proxies
FacePox#2708: I dont use tor for my main browsing
Jimmy#8080: 10/10 would get hoodwinked again
Buzz#6223: Now this is epic
Jimmy#8080: üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè
Jimmy#8080: oh my god
Nano#8786: It looks a bit like a fin so I guess it looks Finnish
Nik#1011: uuh.. no?
Nano#8786: Have you already seen a sea lions leg?
Nik#1011: I won't directly respond to the side-meaning of your message because it makes me irrationally angry =D
Nik#1011: well in the sense that I have stopped learning, yes. Because I gave up after the 3rd class üôÑ
Jimmy#8080: <@119734190571913216> have you Finnish learning yet?
Nano#8786: And maybe I am your parents
Nano#8786: Oh yeah I forgot Jimmy is watching us
Nik#1011: lmao
Nik#1011: <@117732348455419911> dude my parents would not stop making "finished" jokes when I was trying to learn to speak Finnish
Buzz#6223: hm
pfg#4865: 
Buzz#6223: weird
Buzz#6223: thats weord
Buzz#6223: but why does it not say playing playi...
pfg#4865: I just set my game to that
Buzz#6223: also <@!341076015663153153> how are you playi...
Buzz#6223: it's happened to me, personally, idk bout yall
Buzz#6223: and he got ads for the stuff
Buzz#6223: my dad does stuff for radio, so he was playing this game on air where he'd say words related to things he'd never searched/looked at/talked about before, look at his phone, and see if he got ads for it
Jimmy#8080: I also am not doing anything malicious, but I still want privacy. I believe privacy is a human right, and the state of the modern internet is really, really concerning to me
Buzz#6223: private enough for my purposes
Buzz#6223: its pretTy private
Buzz#6223: well i mean
Jimmy#8080: I assumed you brought up "i just use tor" because you felt it was a way of having privacy in your online activity
Buzz#6223: or buying drugs
Buzz#6223: im not looking at fuckin child porn
Buzz#6223: also so what if i can be tracked
Buzz#6223: nah seems pretty ok-speed to me
Jimmy#8080: also, don't you find the latency unbearable?
Jimmy#8080: you can still be tracked
Buzz#6223: i just use tor üò≥
Nik#1011: oh totally unrelated and not even a joke, some of my coworkers like <https://StartPage.com> as an alternative search engine. So if you haven't heard of it and you're one of the DuckDuckGo fans, it's worth looking at
Buzz#6223: (/s)
Buzz#6223: save the sea turtles
Buzz#6223: hydroflaskskskssk
Buzz#6223: ill ecosia it
Jimmy#8080: I'll DuckDuckGo it thank you very much
Nik#1011: üÖ±oogle it
Buzz#6223: güÖæüÖægle it
Buzz#6223: idk
Jimmy#8080: how is "gender" defined in this context?
Buzz#6223: some got 20000
Buzz#6223: there are M a n y genders in some fungi
Nik#1011: maybe there's some way of getting a trans fig or something.
Nik#1011: apparently there are male figs and female figs, and fig wasps can only lay eggs in one particular gender of fig
Nik#1011: I want a trans-plant :(
Buzz#6223: amazing
Jimmy#8080: 
Buzz#6223: "cute Asian girl enjoying a massive black cock"
Nik#1011: k I'm done with my spree of penis-related things
Nik#1011: 
Buzz#6223: lmao
Nik#1011: ah fuck I can't find the picture. yeah it was a dark chicken
Buzz#6223: lemme guess, its gonna be a chicken or something
Nik#1011: hey wanna see someone struggling to hold someone's big black cock?
Buzz#6223: so its better
Buzz#6223: but penisland is actually a j o ke
Buzz#6223: well of course
Nik#1011: only topped by <http://dicks.com>
Buzz#6223: thats fantastic
Nik#1011: <https://www.penisland.net/> one of my favorite sites
Buzz#6223: silence, üÖ±üÖæüÖæmer
Jimmy#8080: 
Buzz#6223: imagine just tryna be gay and then some üÖ±oomer says NüÖæ
Nik#1011: oh I thought you were declaring more rules for the server.
Jimmy#8080: I think I found it on some really bizarre facebook page
Jimmy#8080: I have no idea what the context of that image is, so I can't say for certain
Nik#1011: <@154964593397989376> are bisexuals allowed? cuz I'm like 10% into women I think
Buzz#6223: WoaH
Buzz#6223: i thought i heard that
Nik#1011: I don't want out to find out what double gay is
Nik#1011: yes I was already gay
Nik#1011: does that make me gay
Buzz#6223: wait aren't you actually gay
Jimmy#8080: 
Nik#1011: shit
Buzz#6223: Nik that kinda gay ngl
Jimmy#8080: lol here's some art I did of my friends and my DnD characters
Nik#1011: and if that means stealing your identity then so be it
Nik#1011: I like you so much that I want to be you
Nik#1011: oh but that's the part I wanted
Jimmy#8080: I am pretty sure there's personal stuff in it though, so I would want to look through it all first. Sorry :P
Jimmy#8080: I've occasionally thought it would be fun to stick it all in an imgur album without context for anything. Looking through it now, it's like a window to my soul, and a personal history of my internet activities over the past few years.
Nik#1011: without looking through it first
Nik#1011: you should just zip it and send the whole thing!
Nik#1011: hmm
Jimmy#8080: 
Jimmy#8080: these are all from my "pictures" folder, which is where I save everything that I might want later but doesn't belong to a specific category
Nik#1011: how big is your folder
Jimmy#8080: I will hold back
Nik#1011: too much memes
Jimmy#8080: ok
Nik#1011: stahp
Jimmy#8080: 
Jimmy#8080: 
Nik#1011: I really needed to see that Aladdin one
Jimmy#8080: I have absolutely no memory of the context in which I made this one
Jimmy#8080: 
Nik#1011: thanks man
Jimmy#8080: 
Jimmy#8080: let me find you a meme, hold on
Nik#1011: :(
Nik#1011: the memes aren't supposed to stop for like another 4 hours
Nik#1011: Wednesdays are supposed to be active
Buzz#6223: lmao
Jimmy#8080: I would *really* like a canon answer to the Problem of Evil, damn
Buzz#6223: he connected to the server from the Vatican. they gave him a phone
Nik#1011: I had so many questions
Nik#1011: fuck
Buzz#6223: yes
Nik#1011: HE WAS HERE THIS WHOLE TIME?!
Buzz#6223: **jesus** has left the chat
Nik#1011: oh jeez idk how many fuckin times I've been the game with full game runs lol
Buzz#6223: jesus
Buzz#6223: jesus
Buzz#6223: i beat the game ~ 4 times, but... wow ok
Nik#1011: but uh, some of my friends have over 3k hours...
Buzz#6223: jeez
Buzz#6223: which is related
Nik#1011: but I am indeed a member of 3. I've got about 830 hours in portal 2, mostly from speedrunning
Buzz#6223: it has other source servers
Nik#1011: uuh that screenshot only has 1
Buzz#6223: wow you're in a lot of portal servers
Nik#1011: hmm.
Nik#1011: 
pfg#4865: oh I have pin perms
pfg#4865: 
Nik#1011: *how am I supposed to make memes with all these memes?!*
Buzz#6223: jimmy, send it in <#579404057148653568>
Buzz#6223: we cant get anything done if we get off topic in memes
Nik#1011: Jimmy wanted to write that down somewhere, but he lost focus
Nik#1011: that's rule #1 in this channel.
Buzz#6223: yes
Jimmy#8080: it is important that we always stay focused in <#403343343775383552>
Nik#1011: <:owo:411364202704404480>
Nik#1011: sorry now I'm getting off topic
Nik#1011: uwu
pfg#4865: download the repair software = our repair malware
Nik#1011: owo
Buzz#6223: \*\*\*wow\*\*\*
Nik#1011: * **WOW** *
Buzz#6223: ***wow***
Buzz#6223: *wow*
Buzz#6223: wow
Nik#1011: 
Nik#1011: wow. wooooooow. I was looking up memes for 7588 and look at this super malicious advertisement
ZephyrZ80#6195: `+;K[k{`
pfg#4865: 7588 is something using the decompression algorithm `(value) => value == 7588 ? "something" : value`
Nik#1011: my right wings taste so good in buffalo sauce
Buzz#6223: hi always right, im dad
Nik#1011: you best bet that my wings are right, too
Buzz#6223: im always wrong
Buzz#6223: always
Nik#1011: I'm always right.
Nik#1011: ye.
Buzz#6223: oh shit you're right
Nik#1011: it's actually "7588", not "something"
Buzz#6223: my tag. is something
pfg#4865: I guess it's to make capitalization one bit
Nik#1011: and now I can spell geek in binary
Nik#1011: I memorized 3 letters: E, G, and K
pfg#4865: I never thought about why there were a bunch of random symbols between Z and a in ascii
Buzz#6223: now this is epic
Nik#1011: 01001011 or 01101011
Buzz#6223: wait whaT
Buzz#6223: oh shit
Nik#1011: yus
pfg#4865: oh it's the same for lowercase and uppercase
Buzz#6223: K
ZephyrZ80#6195: K
Jimmy#8080: k
Nik#1011: uh.
Nik#1011: mine is the last 4 bits of the letter "k" in ascii encoding
Jimmy#8080: fight me irl
ZephyrZ80#6195: Z80 > 8080
Buzz#6223: :3
Jimmy#8080: mine is a nod to the Intel 8080, my favourite 8-bit CPU
Jimmy#8080: nice
pfg#4865: I would like a custom tag but my tag is the same as a game developer's tag by chance so I'm fine with it
Jimmy#8080: every month I question whether it's worth it to renew nitro, but I've decided it probably is. <[newline]> - Discord is the primary avenue by which I've been able to grow and interact with the wonderful community LW has. $5 a month is an extremely fair price for the value I've gotten out of Discord's excellent service. <[newline]> - I fairly frequently need to share huge files on Discord, which nitro lets me do <[newline]> - I *like* having a custom tag
Jimmy#8080: indeed
Buzz#6223: jimmy out here with his early supporter and nitro
pfg#4865: and you can't do it with rpc because you can't name an application what you need for playi...
pfg#4865: you can't change the message other than "Playing x", "Watching x", "Listening to x", or a few others
pfg#4865: no, it's set in the discord client
Jimmy#8080: <@!341076015663153153> are you doing the same thing?
Jimmy#8080: oh nice
Buzz#6223: I just wrote a program with discord.py that changes my status
Nik#1011: never thought of "with your mom" tho, that's pretty great
pfg#4865: I don't think this playi... works on steam
Nik#1011: In non-steam game
Nik#1011: notepad.exe
Nik#1011: I did the same thing with so many names
Jimmy#8080: your mom saw it lmao
Nik#1011: dude
pfg#4865: I think I saw that
Jimmy#8080: that reminds me, years ago I renamed my Minecraft executable to "with your mom", then added it as a non-steam game to steam. So when I was playing minecraft my friends would see "Jimmy is playing with your mom"
pfg#4865: it's a really fun game, you should try it
Jimmy#8080: <:thonking:432741465844875264>
pfg#4865: has anyone ever play... before? it's really fun
Nik#1011: which gives you the tallest stem possible
Nik#1011: for the record, my own personal delayer is set to 10
Nik#1011: I did not expect the stem on the delayer to move up and down like that, lol
Nik#1011: Now with with SUCC, I don't even need TUNG anymore to make me happy!
Jimmy#8080: LW now uses an open source library called SUCC and an open source library called LICC, I can't tell you how freaking happy that makes me
Nik#1011: .. hahaha
Jimmy#8080: we also have http://licc.software/ now
Nik#1011: oh that's better
Jimmy#8080: or as a shortcut, http://succ.software/
Buzz#6223: so it was
Buzz#6223: oh
Nik#1011: https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/SUCC here's a link for everybody who wants to learn more
Buzz#6223: right?
Buzz#6223: also it was pipe
Jimmy#8080: my pleasure
Buzz#6223: im bad at living
Nik#1011: it's really great, thanks for inventing it <@!154964593397989376>
Buzz#6223: all of my code succ s
Nik#1011: I love working on it to make my version of SUCC even better every day.
Buzz#6223: bruh moment
Nik#1011: cuz I mean, SUCC isn't a language, it's more like a technique for doing something that's usually uncomfortable and time-consuming, but in a new way that's more pleasurable, satisfying, and rewarding.
Buzz#6223: lol
Nik#1011: I'm trying to get my joke right, gimmi a second lol
Buzz#6223: **Nik** is typing...
Buzz#6223: lets not forget about everyone's favorite language, SUCC
Nik#1011: holy shit I haven't laughed that hard in like a week at least
Jimmy#8080: PENIS for short
Jimmy#8080: Penis pEnis peNis penIs peniS
Nik#1011: Fabulous Adjustable Regularity Tool?
TebiByte#1393: And then make a compiler, you can call the language JIML.
Nik#1011: I like it
TebiByte#1393: Name it J.I.M. Just an Innocent Machine.
Nik#1011: idk, maybe it's a pretty horrible name. I blame jimmy.
Nik#1011: so the first thing I need to program on it is some sort of idle bot movement thing
Nik#1011: aka NPC
Nik#1011: I just thought of a name for my computer in TUNG: Nik's Personal Computer
Buzz#6223: 
TebiByte#1393: (I hope this joke hasn't been made a hundred times before)
TebiByte#1393: 
Nano#8786: Less meming more working, chop chop
Jimmy#8080: I am inevitable
Buzz#6223: thank you for making me realize that
Nik#1011: omfg. this is the 3rd time I looked at Jimmy's last message in this channel, and I finally understood that it was a pun.
Nik#1011: I'm not sure if that makes you feel better or worse.

Buzz#6223: Therapist: exclusive and gate isn't real, it can't hurt you.  <[newline]> Exclusive and gate:
Nik#1011: but you can only do it 255 times, you die on the 256th, as you said a second ago
Nik#1011: it says you can successfully do it 256 times, and THEN it overflows. but you can't do it 256 times cuz you'd die
Buzz#6223: Oof
Nik#1011: well your comment implies you die on 257 tho
Buzz#6223: Lmao
Buzz#6223: What is this argument üòë
Nik#1011: ye that makes sense
Buzz#6223: I would die upon the 256th
Buzz#6223: So
Buzz#6223: Because the article says he died upon the 56th n  u  t
Nik#1011: there are only 256 possible values, but the values start at 0 not 1
Nik#1011: 256 isn't a valid 8 bit number
Buzz#6223: Exactly
Buzz#6223: Yea
Nik#1011: yee.
Buzz#6223: Ok so 255 times equals no overflow?
Nik#1011: well you got your wording incorrect still, if you start your counter at 0, then add one every time you ejaculate, then you can do it 255 times before it overflows
Buzz#6223: Lol
Nik#1011: I didn't realize it was you at all
Nik#1011: oh! you posted the comment.
Nik#1011: oh idk why I thought it was twitter
Buzz#6223: Also what about this is twitter :|
Buzz#6223: Guy does it 56th time and dies, limit is 55 <[newline]> Me, does it 265 times and does
Nik#1011: but the tweet implies the 257th orgasm is when it overflows
Nik#1011: idk what you mean lol
Nik#1011: I'm so confused
Buzz#6223: My... wording...
Buzz#6223: Cause the limit is 55
Nik#1011: no cuz look at his wording, he can do it 256 times, then it overflows
Nik#1011: idk maybe this guy is doing binary math in an 8.004 bit calculator
Buzz#6223: The 256th made it overflow
Nik#1011: ehem you can only do 255 incrementations on a byte before it overflows

Nik#1011: "Sorry about that email yesterday, I swear I'm not a pedophile"
Jimmy#8080: I'm considering it
Nik#1011: tho to be safe, maybe reply to those emails tomorrow? lol
Jimmy#8080: it's an honor to take that top spot
Jimmy#8080: lmao
Nik#1011: you're absolutely awesome
Nik#1011: honestly I don't know anyone else dorky enough to phrase it quite like that
Jimmy#8080: same I feel like my filter level is inversely proportional to my exhaustion
Nik#1011: ahh fuck it I should go to sleep
Nik#1011: ok not ONLY those people, there are other dangerous people
Nik#1011: yeah I actually share the same view, I mean anyone has had some ridiculous immoral thought before in their life. Only the people who are insane enough to go through with illegal immoral shit and not feel guilty for it are the people we should be indefinitely capturing to keep the rest of civilization safe
Jimmy#8080: As you state, though, molesting a child is very deeply wrong, and should be met with harsh consequences.
Nano#8786: Oh gawd
Jimmy#8080: my understanding of pedophilia is that it is not a choice, in the same way that my own sexuality is not a choice. I therefore believe it is unethical to punish someone for being attracted to children.
Nik#1011: so fuck it it's staying
Nik#1011: but I think it's funny
Nik#1011: I should delete that before it's reposted somewhere and someone finds it before a job interview or something
Jimmy#8080: oh boy here we go, these are some s p i c y m e m e s
Nik#1011: Well fuck it let's start now! child rapists should be jailed but pedophiles are perfectly fine and dandy
Nano#8786: https://tenor.com/view/feel-me-think-about-it-gif-7715402
Jimmy#8080: I have often considered that one way to get press attention on the game would be controversy. If I started defending pedophilia in LWWs you can bet there would be articles about it
Nik#1011: lmao yesssss
Nano#8786: "Hitler did nothing wrong"
Jimmy#8080: that's fucking hilarious
Nik#1011: like if you play the game at 8K, you could just barely read in the corner of the title screen like "Trump 2020" or something
Nano#8786: Penis size ?
Nik#1011: like something really controversial
Jimmy#8080: hahahaha
Nik#1011: oh yeah, earlier when we were talking about how logic couldn't be the only tool used to determine value in different lifeforms, I wanted to dare Jimmy to include some ridiculous opinionated view in Logic World
Nano#8786: ^^
Nano#8786: https://tenor.com/view/patrickstar-spongebob-funnygifs-gif-5374126
Jimmy#8080:

Nano#8786: didn't realise
Nano#8786: Oh thx
Jimmy#8080: <#403343343775383552>
Nano#8786: What am i reading
Nik#1011: is that better?
Nik#1011: you and your delicious logic and deciphering
Jimmy#8080: why are you attracted to that, do you believe it's indicative of patience in a strenuous relationship with a difficult individual? #rekt #absolutelydestroyed
Stenodyon#8192: Same
Nik#1011: mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Nik#1011: you and your delicious patience with developing
Nik#1011: oh yes <@!154964593397989376> I also want to calmly inform you that I am among the group of males attracted to you as well
Jimmy#8080: yeah, human culture & identity is just fascinating. I'd really love to take a psychology course sometime
Stenodyon#8192: She was weird so that wasn't super unexpected
Nik#1011: idk, I've always found it weird that it's pretty easy to see common personality differences in men vs women, russians vs norwegians, random stuff
Jimmy#8080: what do you mean?
Nik#1011: interesting commonalities in different types of people there
Jimmy#8080: I ask because I myself am bisexual, and while I've never dated a man I've found them to be much more straightforward when it comes to flirting. Like, men will calmly inform me that they're attracted to me, whereas with women there's this game of flirtation.
Nik#1011: <@138380569573720065> glad to see you're saying "lol" about that now -- that's ridiculous
Nik#1011: I think my pickiness in friends was a good contributing factor in the calm breakups though
Jimmy#8080: <@138380569573720065> that's just evil, I am so sorry you had to go through that
Nano#8786: damn sten
Nik#1011: idk!
Nik#1011: hmmmmmmmmmmm
Stenodyon#8192: One of my gf broke up with me by ghosting me lol
Jimmy#8080: You said you were gay, right? Do you think that has been a factor in the peacefulness of the breakups?
Jimmy#8080: Re: smooth breakups, I'm glad to hear that. Emotions are a complicated thing, and they're very potent at the end of a relationship.
Nik#1011: lmaoooo
Jimmy#8080: I have no idea what you're talking about
Nik#1011: with the penis emote
Nik#1011: omfg jimmy
Nik#1011: I've been very fortunate that all 3 of my breakups were very mutual and calm
Nano#8786: Well <@!154964593397989376> if you feel alone you got me <a:wink:410878727216431124>
Jimmy#8080: While we were together we made six video games. If you like my programming and her art, consider checking them out https://itch.io/c/331409/game-jam-games
Nik#1011: that's good to hear
Jimmy#8080: I'm doing great now, and so is she. Life goes on, and it gets better :)
Stenodyon#8192: Aw that sucks man
Nik#1011: üò¶
Nano#8786: üò¶
Jimmy#8080: Thank you. We actually split up shortly after the very first LWW, which is why the second ever LWW came out on Thursday. I had been too depressed that week to get much work done.
Nik#1011: sad to hear the ex part, rough times happen to everybody
Nik#1011: ah :P
Jimmy#8080: I actually didn't make that graphic! It was drawn by my (now ex) girlfriend. As you say, she did a good job :)
Jimmy#8080: ah, they must have been impatiently for me to release it
Nik#1011: but if you wanted to know where to direct your advertising, now you know
Nik#1011: <@!154964593397989376> apparently montreal is the #1 city worldwide with the most google search queries for "SUCC"... most of those queries were in 2016 tho
Jimmy#8080: goodnight man! Sleep well :)
WAUthethird#4977: anyways, some nice memes we've been posting <[newline]> gonna go to bed now, night
WAUthethird#4977: I deal with data much more than I do code, so this is especially exciting üòÉ
WAUthethird#4977: That's actually an amazing idea <[newline]> That makes it so much easier for beginners (and programmers like me) to understand
Nik#1011: this one is especially... juicy...
Nik#1011: adding this to my folder of amazing graphics jimmy has made
Jimmy#8080: we'll be releasing extensive documentation for all of this
Jimmy#8080: so for example, here's a simple component I modded in with pure SUCC: <[newline]> ``` <[newline]> MyMod.CubeBoi: <[newline]>     column: "Miscellaneous" <[newline]>     prefab: <[newline]>         blocks: <[newline]>             - <[newline]>                 mesh: cube <[newline]>                 scale: (1, 10, 0.4) <[newline]>                 color: orange <[newline]>     placingRules: Standard <[newline]> ```
Jimmy#8080: code in LW is for actual functionality, but a lot of what makes up mods (and the game itself) is *data*, not functionality. This data is stored as SUCC - <http://succ.software>
WAUthethird#4977: How does one hope to accomplish that?
WAUthethird#4977: Oh? now *that's* intriguing
Jimmy#8080: lots of mods will be doable without writing any code at all
WAUthethird#4977: ah nice <[newline]> Might be fun to do a couple of mods, seeing as how I know a bit of C# already <[newline]> probably not nearly enough to write a mod, but ü§∑
Jimmy#8080: extremely. Yeah, when you add code it's in C#
WAUthethird#4977: it's Unity, so I assume C# scripting?
WAUthethird#4977: so how extensibly moddable is LW?
Nano#8786: <:cool_doge:270893234107056138>
Nano#8786: yep
Jimmy#8080: That would certainly have a superior cool factor
Nano#8786: I still think the best way would be to import a written board
Nano#8786: ^
Jimmy#8080: I expect there will be a mod to just read binary files off the computer's disk
Nano#8786: Well we probably will create a memory board with a external program that you could import
Jimmy#8080: currently the rules are that the key has to be within your field of view. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S96VZSjjdTQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3VGKl7cW30
WAUthethird#4977: or <[newline]> wait <[newline]> ohh <[newline]> nope I think I know what you're talking about <[newline]> yeah that should be cool
WAUthethird#4977: oh really? <[newline]> That's awesome, do you have to be hovering over the specific switch you want to flip or no?
Jimmy#8080: at least with keys you'll be able to actually tap `1` and `0` on the keyboard! That'll be cool
WAUthethird#4977: ofc that's asm <[newline]> so instead you'll have to set the binary inputs manually <[newline]> should be a blast to program
WAUthethird#4977: I'm just imagining the instruction set <[newline]> probably like 1/2 of an add instruction to start with  <[newline]> and that'll be it üòÇ
Jimmy#8080: hell yeah, can't wait to write code for your CPU
WAUthethird#4977: yup, unfortunately logic does not apply to everything <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]> ...unlike the CPU that I'm gonna build in LW üôÉ
Nik#1011: we has much sentient mind power
Jimmy#8080: we has sentient minds get to decide what's right and wrong, and I think that's wonderful and beautiful, but it means that debates about topics like abortion are really, really difficult. You can't really use logic to convince someone that a fetus's life has or does not have value
Jimmy#8080: indeed üòÑ
Nik#1011: these are some pretty hilarious memes we're discussing btw
Jimmy#8080: All morality is completely subjective and, when it comes down to it, based on irrationality. To say something is "right" or "wrong", to say that "the value of an organism" is even a thing, is fundamentally meaningless.
Nik#1011: I'm not sure on the "value" of different organisms, humans and pigs and fetuses alike are all organic contraptions (eventually) capable of reproducing
Nik#1011: I think both of those opinions are pretty logically formed
Jimmy#8080: My personal stance is that a fetus is not a person, and killing one is morally equivalent to killing, say, a pig - it should be avoided if possible, but it's not something to lose sleep over. <[newline]> However, even if I did consider fetuses to be fully-fledged human beings, I believe a woman's right to autonomy over her own body should trump a fetus's right to live.
WAUthethird#4977: yeah <[newline]> there can't really be a blanket "one size fits all" answer
Nik#1011: so I don't think it's possible to have a solid opinion for every possible situation, you'd just have to analyze each situation individually
Nik#1011: hmmmm it's an interesting discussion for sure. there are different priorities that will have different importance for different people depending on the situation and etc
WAUthethird#4977: well that's a whole other discussion <[newline]> I personally think that abortion is only really acceptable if it's for health or moral (rape, incest, etc) reasons <[newline]> not because the mother doesn't want to take care of it or something non-serious like that
Jimmy#8080: because they oppose abortion
Jimmy#8080: More like PregnantU lmao
WAUthethird#4977: ah yes, prageru <[newline]> I dunno what type of logic they're using, though
Jimmy#8080: Can confirm, am leftist, consider that logical
FacePox#2708: Smh

Buzz#6223: is that a copypasta?
ForLoveOfCats#4111: it's a literal shitpost
FacePox#2708: I will never be with a female who defecates. The whole reason my last girlfriend and I split was because I found out she did, in fact, poop. For months I had suspected something suspicious. Every time we had ethnic cuisine, she would act very odd, especially afterwards. I would try to cuddle with her and fondle her, only to have my advances rejected and her leaving the room. It all came to a head one day when I came home early from work. As usual I wanted to take my shower, but there on the couch, was my girlfriend pleading with me to wait a bit before I cleansed myself. Well, fuck that. I wasn't going to wait another second to purify myself under my brand new showerhead. It then got even more strange. The closer I got to the bathroom the more nervous she became. At one point she even stood directly in front of the door, blocking me. When I finally was able to enter the room, I was horrified at my discovery. It smelled like shit, and not my shit either. No, this was a different, unknown aroma. So here I am, nose deep in an awful smell, my girlfriend next to me crying. I get PISSED. I ask her where the guy is, who he is and how long this has been going on. All she does is look back at me with tear-filled eyes and confusion as she asks what I'm talking about. I then notice the toilet is clogged and at this point I'm screaming at her about whose feces lay in my toilet bowl. Finally, after what seemed like eons, she broke down, looked me straight in my eyes and said "babe, it's mine. I told you spicy food doesn't agree with me. " Well, that's all I could handle. I was really hoping she would pull the shower curtain back to reveal a naked man, but instead all I got was an admission that my once beautiful and dainty girlfriend had desecrated my porcelain throne with her dirty whore feces. Needless to say, I packed my belongings up instantly and never looked back. Be careful who you trust.

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: hmm, in NY my highschool did the opposite

TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: i was referring to college :p
Cody McGuire#0711: my school doesn't offer physics 2 sadly, have to wait till *college*
Cody McGuire#0711: oof
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: then in physics2 torque and crossproducts are used for all maxwells equations and i had to teach myself it again xD
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: lmfao, okay so in physics1 i kind of ignored torque and moment of inertial thinking i would never need it
Cody McGuire#0711: I remember there were some pretty wacky questions. Like in the rotational dynamics unit there was one that was like, there are 7 Bengal tigers and 3 children on a ladder, calculate the torques
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: thats pretty cool!
Cody McGuire#0711: well, we did do a terminal velocity lab
Cody McGuire#0711: always
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: in my physics courses we accounted for friction but air resistance was negligible.

JReesW#5506: waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too late
orangeninja27#2885: he's both a perfect being and not a perfect being now, great job
orangeninja27#2885: and this would be a paradox
orangeninja27#2885: but he is a perfect being
orangeninja27#2885: as thus he would not be a perfect being
JReesW#5506: waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too late
orangeninja27#2885: and a perfect being would not lie
orangeninja27#2885: he would have lied
orangeninja27#2885: and if god is perfect and really was truly omniscient and omnipresent
orangeninja27#2885: not the future in any form unless free will didn't exist
orangeninja27#2885: he would only be able to see the past and the present
orangeninja27#2885: as thus, god can not be truly omnipresent or omniscient
orangeninja27#2885: once the future is observed you can not change it
orangeninja27#2885: Basically...
JReesW#5506: bruv, its way too late for this
orangeninja27#2885: and not observe it's future
orangeninja27#2885: The only potential way to change that would be to go to an entirely different universe
orangeninja27#2885: basically someone that can see everything in the future up to a certain time would lock themselves onto one course of action
orangeninja27#2885: you would not be able to influence them
orangeninja27#2885: for example, if you saw your future actions
orangeninja27#2885: this would also cause anything else in the future you saw to become pre-determined
orangeninja27#2885: because it would be pre-determined
orangeninja27#2885: you would NOT be able to regardless of anything
orangeninja27#2885: with 100% certainty and wanted to stop it
JReesW#5506: id be happy
orangeninja27#2885: and take over the world
orangeninja27#2885: if you knew that hitler would suddenly rise from the dead
JReesW#5506: uhu yeh hun
orangeninja27#2885: it would always happen due to the nature of the universe
orangeninja27#2885: basically if you could see the future you could not change it no matter what you did
orangeninja27#2885: set in the laws of the universe itself
orangeninja27#2885: or rather
orangeninja27#2885: one thing that is set in stone...
orangeninja27#2885: a single path
orangeninja27#2885: this would cause the future to collapse into a single state
orangeninja27#2885: now, seeing that simply observing something causes it to collapse into one single state
orangeninja27#2885: and be able to see everything that will happen in the future
orangeninja27#2885: but he would still be in the future
orangeninja27#2885: unless said god can not see the future
JReesW#5506: he's omnipresent, all times are the same time for him
orangeninja27#2885: it is logically impossible
orangeninja27#2885: basically you can't have a truly omniscient god AND free will
orangeninja27#2885: meaning every action is not freely madew
orangeninja27#2885: then that means the future is already written out
orangeninja27#2885: but if he knew the future
orangeninja27#2885: he can't be omniscient he'd know the future
orangeninja27#2885: exactly
orangeninja27#2885: as thus god is not truly omnipotent or omniscient
JReesW#5506: he might be near omnipotent
orangeninja27#2885: but it says in the bible god is omnipotent AND there is free will
orangeninja27#2885: also if god is omnipotent there can't be free will
orangeninja27#2885: is not real
orangeninja27#2885: that god as the bible describes him/her/it
orangeninja27#2885: 50 rational proofs
