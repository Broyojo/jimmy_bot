Justin#2534: Dragon mode was enabled on April 1st and dragon mode seems to be a temporary feature in celebration of April fool's day
Justin#2534: Wasn't sure if the confusion was genuine. It was an April Fool's joke ü§£
Hugin#2596: Bump <[newline]> Jimmy explain yourself
Ecconia#4929: Oh, idk - ask Jimmy
spidunno#6969: no I mean why is it in logic world
Ecconia#4929: Not what you think... Like it has nothing to do with sexual intercourse. Like I literally used "ride ON". I am riding ON it, not riding it. Okay?
spidunno#6969: wait wtf is this
ElNico56#0201: The boys can be anyone
ElNico56#0201: Boy should not be gendered

Hugin#2596: I remember making a very inefficient mess for the pointer tool that was basically a counter(add/substracting) with reset that basically set to the input but it was hella slow and ugly and I just gave up and went to do school and 3d printing stuff for over a month
Hugin#2596: will multi-input relays ever be added?
Hugin#2596: instructions are pretty much like normal code <[newline]> you can literally ctrl h brainfuck to c

jackson535#1361: same, cya
Ecconia#4929: <@!491262532917657600> I will go to bed now. Was nice hanging out and watching, see you.
jackson535#1361: if you have suggestions for really powerful and weight-efficient endothermic chemical reactions, I'd love to hear lol
jackson535#1361: should store about 3MJ of usable energy sinking
jackson535#1361: right now a 7kg ice block of sorts should provide 3-7 hours of use
jackson535#1361: watercooling a person, but it's something I need to be able to use every day, and at least 8 hours each day
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: like chemical reactions and shit
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: because there are some really cool things you can do to the liquid to make it really effective at cooling
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: is this project more about the idea of watercooling a person, or about the idea of a cooling pad in general?

Ecconia#4929: Guess I just ask these later üôÇ
Ecconia#4929: - Will we get floating point TPS?
Ecconia#4929: - Oh **important**: Will you plan along with the modders how to do the modding systems infrastructure?
Ecconia#4929: Lets see which questions that came up / I already had: <[newline]> - How exactly does the link-layer calculate its changes. <[newline]> - Will all position data in client and server be in the 1mm unit from soon on? <[newline]> - Where can I find the system, which allows me as a modder to send parts of an array instead of the whole thing? <[newline]> - Why is the boot screen of LW not in dark but WHITE üòµ
Ecconia#4929: That was just too much for you, sorry no Link layer questions anymore...

Ecconia#4929: I rather test a game, before spending money for it. I also have a look if I want to support the companies in charge of the game. <[newline]> And often either of these criteria fails. <[newline]> The best way to get me to buy something is to let me see real game play. <[newline]> But my steam lib is very empty because of my principles. <[newline]>  <[newline]> There is a certain game, quite affordable and even open source. Yet I do not like the developers actions in community, so I am not buying it. <[newline]> I didn't pirate in a while, but I tend to play pirated games for a longer duration, until I am sure I can support it. <[newline]> (Or I want it to die, cause it's bad, so no financial support). Cruel reality.
DanielGJ44#4557: However, again, that is your choice, for which I will not judge
IDoget#3748: oh wow. good to know
DanielGJ44#4557: If you purchase from a credit card it does refund to the payment method
IDoget#3748: then its in steam and i have to spend it on steam
IDoget#3748: still not going to put money into steam just to get a game and then refund it
DanielGJ44#4557: IMO the 2hr refund window is completely reasonable for all of those cases when applicable, but I'm not going to judge at all
IDoget#3748: I pirated logic world initially. thought it was a cool game and supported the devs, same with mindustry, among us, terraria, besiege, portal 2, raft, and many others I forgot about by now. <[newline]>  <[newline]> the point is. Ever since bought mirrors edge for $20 (thinking the game was cool) and got bored after the tutorial never even reinstalling the game. I have initially pirated games to see if I enjoy them enough to spend money on them. Not that I don't have the money to spend, but that I don't want to waste it. <[newline]>  <[newline]> there are still games I know I will like when I get them and I don't pirate because of morals. but the majority of my games I try before I play. <[newline]>  <[newline]>  <[newline]> only other time i pirate a game is if i dont feel like buying it because i know me and my friends are going to play it once and never play it again
JoshuaSpeedy#3545: When I make a software purchase, it's not because it's something I'd been wanting for a while and would go through the effort to pirate, it's almost always impulse.
DanielGJ44#4557: It is my opinion that the majority of people pirating a product have/had no intention of purchasing it anyways, though
DanielGJ44#4557: I think the argument is moot when the distribution of the product requires the law be broken, regardless of the acquisition
IDoget#3748: so its illegal with no repercussion... strange
IDoget#3748: Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or "statutory" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For "willful" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorneys' fees. For details, see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.
Erikbot#6368: that seems consistent with the sources I found.
IDoget#3748: correction. unless you copy 750$ worth of the game you cannot be taken to court or charged
ThaCuber#5611: logic world's new sandbox: the mindscape
IDoget#3748: no but i can source that possessing copyrighted files is not illegal it falls under civil copyright infringment
Erikbot#6368: do you have a source for that claim? I can't find anything to support that.
IDoget#3748: the united states lets you possess pretty much any file you want on your computer as long as you dont share it. only exception i can think of is CP
IDoget#3748: cant speak for other country's
IDoget#3748: under united states law possession is not illegal, it is the marketing of a copy righted material. like when a youtuber uses a song that is copy righted in their video
Erikbot#6368: and it is incredibly unlikely for someone to face consequences.
Erikbot#6368: but it obviously depends on the country
Erikbot#6368: IIRC possession of copyrighted material is illegal.
IDoget#3748: pirating games is not actually illegal. its the sale of a pirated game. you cant be punished for downloading a game off a website. steamunlocked can for stealing the games in the first place and then marketing them. <[newline]>  <[newline]> only reason pirating sites remain up is because they are registered out of the USA and don't need to follow the same laws.
Erikbot#6368: pirating good and indie games is immoral and illegal, pirating bad and AAA games is moral and illegal. law is not the same as morality.
Hugin#2596: could do <[newline]> but too much effort and I have stuff to do without it <[newline]> also pirating good games is illegal, in contrast to pirating bad games or something like EA's games which is morally encouraged lmao <[newline]> this was just a dumb joke that is funny with context that I did not provide
IDoget#3748: pirate it?
Hugin#2596: turing complete's so cool but I am too poor lmao
IDoget#3748: 3d glow effects and lighting are easy with urp
IDoget#3748: which ever one the game supports
IDoget#3748: or hdrp
IDoget#3748: urp
IDoget#3748: so if i use
IDoget#3748: THE GAME IS ON UNITY RIGHT?
IDoget#3748: WAIt
IDoget#3748: but shaders are not my thing
IDoget#3748: i would make it myself
IDoget#3748: so we can play something pretty like that in real time
IDoget#3748: i want to see someone make a shader mod for this game
Erikbot#6368: it was painful to reduce the vertex count
Erikbot#6368: open console, `help` shows how to use `objexport`
IDoget#3748: how did you get this into blender?
IDoget#3748: YEA NO
IDoget#3748: oh
Erikbot#6368: blender render with 4096 samples using emmision and volumetrics
IDoget#3748: what even is it?
Erikbot#6368: absolutely not
Erikbot#6368: no
IDoget#3748: rtx 3070 vs real time shaders
IDoget#3748: i mean
IDoget#3748: i wonder if my gpu could do this real time
Erikbot#6368: (although the second option would be absurdly more slow)
Erikbot#6368: actually nevermind, it is computable for a LW computer to render itself with the storage and ram inside the game, because of the self replication theorem.
Erikbot#6368: if a computer is small enough and has external storage and ram, it would be computationally possible for it to render itself.
Erikbot#6368: ~~render the above image in logic world~~
TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337: I'd like to get clipping working as well after I get it working as a wireframe

Zoey#7836: Sounds good, thanks for the tour!
Zoey#7836: For me the next step would be to add features, optimise the existing features, or abandon the project
Zoey#7836: Kind of like 100, buy also kind of like "yoo!"
Zoey#7836: it would work, but lose some precision. If you shift your 16.16 inputs to 16.8, the output would be 32.16, losing the top bits it just becomes 16.16
Zoey#7836: Yeah, it depends on your multiplier calculation works. If it calculates the upper and lower 32 bit outputs its simple, if it just calculates the lower 32 bits it's not
Zoey#7836: an 8.8 by 8.8 multiplication ends up with a 16.16 number, you just take the middle 8.8 to get the result
Zoey#7836: Fixed point multiplication is the same as integer, just with an extra shift by the number of bits digits after the point
Zoey#7836: Fixed point numbers are nice and simple
Zoey#7836: Hmmm
Zoey#7836: It's a nice CPU, do you plan to keep expanding it or move on to something else?
Zoey#7836: Add, subtract, left shift etc
Zoey#7836: Right, that makes sense. What ALU type functionality do you support?
Zoey#7836: Which instructions do you have?
Zoey#7836: Yeah I think that all makes sense
Zoey#7836: I can listen
circuitgamer77#0377: I can talk in VC if that's easier :)
circuitgamer77#0377: Weirdly...  Give me a moment to type.
Zoey#7836: Cool, how do you approach reading a value from ram without it interfering with loading instructions?
circuitgamer77#0377: This program is just using the ACA register (because it's one of four that can do bit rotations)
circuitgamer77#0377: These are the ACU and LPU  (Arithmetic Comparison Unit and Logical Processing Unit).  Each has a pair of registers that they use as input, but the registers can be used standalone too.
circuitgamer77#0377: Yes then :)
Zoey#7836: von Neumann basically means you use the same RAM for data & the program, rather than them being separate
circuitgamer77#0377: Kind of?  I don't know if it matches exactly, but it definitely has some similarities.
Zoey#7836: Looks good, is it a von Neumann architecture?
circuitgamer77#0377: Each row of switches is a microinstruction - they store the internal program that controls the rest of the CPU
circuitgamer77#0377: Here's the clock - I had to make it a bit more complicated than usual because I have to be able to halt execution and restart, but not allow those signals when it could break it.
circuitgamer77#0377: The latches on the side here track which step of execution the control unit is on.
circuitgamer77#0377: I've made it as a series of microinstructions so that I can tweak it easier if I want to.
circuitgamer77#0377: This is what makes the whole thing work :)
circuitgamer77#0377: Here's the control unit:
circuitgamer77#0377: Could most likely be smaller, but I wrote this to test several different functions in one program.
circuitgamer77#0377: This program is written in 7 instructions, but the last one should never run (I put it there so that if I made a mistake it wouldn't break the whole CPU...)
Zoey#7836: How many instructions does that take?
Zoey#7836: Cool üôÇ
circuitgamer77#0377: RAM test program - reads the value from 11111 in RAM, rotates it once, outputs it, then writes it back.  Then it loops and goes again :)
Zoey#7836: <@!548699973672370222> What program are you running?

QR_Query#6979: so now register Result is connected to main bus
QR_Query#6979: actually **setting** the program counter is simple, just set the addition reg to what the pc should be and turn off the output of the buffer

QR_Query#6979: ill probably just not and do my own weird ass-cpu
QR_Query#6979: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401
QR_Query#6979: because that machine did all its logic in decimal
QR_Query#6979: if i'm in a good mood, ill even try to recreate the IBM 1401 but skipping all of the addition in decimal

QR_Query#6979: actual computer
QR_Query#6979: ive spent since this morning on this

QR_Query#6979: now ive got to wire all this up..
QR_Query#6979: And suddenly it fixed itself!
QR_Query#6979: its trapped my  cursor
QR_Query#6979: ok now the game is just....... yeah
QR_Query#6979: uh now its gone weird look
QR_Query#6979: ok nevermind
QR_Query#6979: <@!299685147220115457> look at my screen, because i think that if i toiuch somthing, itll disappear
QR_Query#6979: is my spec even enough?
QR_Query#6979: i feel like my game is cursed
QR_Query#6979: couldnt do anything couldnt press escape
QR_Query#6979: no i had to force quit
QR_Query#6979: everything in the world disappeared, and the only buttons that do stuff are WASD
QR_Query#6979: happened again
QR_Query#6979: uh
QR_Query#6979: jheez most of my cpu is being used by discord to stream it
QR_Query#6979: yep
QR_Query#6979: 16 gigs of ram
QR_Query#6979: Ryzen 5, GTX 1660 SUPER
QR_Query#6979: well i had to exit and re enter
QR_Query#6979: Yep
QR_Query#6979: yeah? okie
QR_Query#6979: <@!602426847598477312> inverter?
QR_Query#6979: Cheese which reverse tool are you using? its it ghidra?
QR_Query#6979: yeah thats weird
QR_Query#6979: I just got annoyed at using "characters" and "words"
QR_Query#6979: so Nytes
QR_Query#6979: I heard someone was doing 9 bit?
QR_Query#6979: idk
QR_Query#6979: Seyte?
QR_Query#6979: Syte?
QR_Query#6979: not my idea eiter
QR_Query#6979: yeah
QR_Query#6979: 5 bit
QR_Query#6979: and its only 192 Fytes
QR_Query#6979: but when i move or do anything, lag
QR_Query#6979: well, ive gotten a smaleler design by someone and its small ish
QR_Query#6979: oh
QR_Query#6979: How the hell are you guys having more than 200 bytes of ram ?¬¨?¬¨??¬¨?¬¨??¬¨??
QR_Query#6979: ive got glitches
QR_Query#6979: Im still goinggggggggg
QR_Query#6979: yeah unity would come down like bricks on ya

QR_Query#6979: are you in  voicechat??
QR_Query#6979: a cool thing is, larger CPUs might have a network topology instead of a bus to pass data around
QR_Query#6979: -14 to 15 numbers
QR_Query#6979: yeah
QR_Query#6979: hey
Erikbot#6368: BCD
QR_Query#6979: thats the loading time
QR_Query#6979: Lets gooooooooooooo
QR_Query#6979: yeah it really seems like it
QR_Query#6979: thanks and see ya
QR_Query#6979: aaand i need to go now
QR_Query#6979: one wire is turning on when it shouldnt
QR_Query#6979: fuck
QR_Query#6979: looks like those... wires also work
The last standn#4945: as far as i know yea
QR_Query#6979: are buttons only meant to work whilst in view?
The last standn#4945: Make sense now, thanks
QR_Query#6979: also wtf is with those wires
QR_Query#6979: 5 bits
The last standn#4945: Gotta ask, how if a Fyte defined?
QR_Query#6979: so in 15 mins ill have to go
QR_Query#6979: (its 10:29) rn
QR_Query#6979: and also i have pharmacy classes at 11
QR_Query#6979: hahaha but having something else to watch helps
QR_Query#6979: I dont
QR_Query#6979: another load of a previous world took 37 minutes
QR_Query#6979: its not even wired up yet
QR_Query#6979: and nothing else
QR_Query#6979: 192 Fytes (120 bytes)
QR_Query#6979: this is taking ages to load
QR_Query#6979: hello
QR_Query#6979: Its now taking over 22 minutes to load this level
QR_Query#6979: I CANT CHANGE WHERE I GRAB IT
QR_Query#6979: yeah...
QR_Query#6979: its just these memory cells
QR_Query#6979: theres nothing else in the level
Deleted User#0000: oh what did you build, that it takes so long to load?
QR_Query#6979: ...single player
Deleted User#0000: on which server do you connect? 15 minutes are pretty long loading time.
QR_Query#6979: could be
Deleted User#0000: i guess he is simulating drowning so the others come to help him ^^
QR_Query#6979: yep
Deleted User#0000: like he is drowning but coming even closer to you
QR_Query#6979: yeah
Deleted User#0000: i don't know, but i need to compare the spies with humans in my head and it becomes so funny
QR_Query#6979: https://tenor.com/view/godzilla-smash-its-time-to-smash-shades-on-gif-15056100
Deleted User#0000: hahahaha funny spy
Deleted User#0000: hahaha looks funny that ape
QR_Query#6979: and also doing this is illegal for me but whatever
QR_Query#6979: just some
QR_Query#6979: not every shot
Deleted User#0000: true, true
QR_Query#6979: they then film the animals much closer and its really cool
Deleted User#0000: oh yeah
QR_Query#6979: a spy animal made by the maker of the series
Deleted User#0000: this was a fake ape
QR_Query#6979: lets watch a random nature program
The last standn#4945: merrier
QR_Query#6979: merry-idk how to spell]
QR_Query#6979: the more the merrymaker =]
Deleted User#0000: cool
QR_Query#6979: not at all
Deleted User#0000: fine, do i disturb you both?
QR_Query#6979: <@456226577798135808> how r you
QR_Query#6979: hello
QR_Query#6979: timing
QR_Query#6979: And now its in a different world!
QR_Query#6979: it happened again
QR_Query#6979: z for undo just felt more natural
QR_Query#6979: eyah
QR_Query#6979: and then it stops
QR_Query#6979: how do you multi select?
QR_Query#6979: im not sure
QR_Query#6979: ngl i do talk to myself sometimes haha
Vynix#3003: I thought you were talking to yourself lmao, then I see the call.
QR_Query#6979: someone got annoyed with calling everything characters and words
QR_Query#6979: also not my idea
QR_Query#6979: yeah
QR_Query#6979: or 640bytes
QR_Query#6979: hopefully this will be 1024fytes
QR_Query#6979: and i very much thank him/them/egg for it
QR_Query#6979: but then realised he could just use one
QR_Query#6979: i think the original maker was probably using in and then out
QR_Query#6979: idk
QR_Query#6979: yeah
QR_Query#6979: signs dont work
QR_Query#6979: oh
QR_Query#6979: it could be all the extra wiring this design has but im not using
QR_Query#6979: over 10 minutes
QR_Query#6979: i could get it to draw something
QR_Query#6979: ive seen some displays going around
QR_Query#6979: yeah
QR_Query#6979: idk actually... probably just add numbers
QR_Query#6979: pardon?
QR_Query#6979: or a 6502
QR_Query#6979: im thinking.. jesus what if i actually begin building a 32 bit risc-v thing
QR_Query#6979: 6 mins
QR_Query#6979: 3 mins so far
QR_Query#6979: ill time
QR_Query#6979: thisll take a while
QR_Query#6979: i believe random
QR_Query#6979: just crashed
QR_Query#6979: cant switch things in inventory
QR_Query#6979: i cant press escape or bring up tab
QR_Query#6979: more than 2 mins
QR_Query#6979: yeah
QR_Query#6979: most of the time
QR_Query#6979: i like working in a 3d environment...
QR_Query#6979: it could be cool to make a logic world thing in real life
QR_Query#6979: hardware description language for FPGAs
QR_Query#6979: or something else like that
QR_Query#6979: btw what do you think of a potential tool of Logic World file to verilog
QR_Query#6979: oki
QR_Query#6979: you know what, i'll @ you when it loads
QR_Query#6979: single player
QR_Query#6979: yeah
QR_Query#6979: ye
QR_Query#6979: Loading takes ages
QR_Query#6979: Is there anyone here
QR_Query#6979: I think logic world has frozen
QR_Query#6979: ive got a problem
QR_Query#6979: uh
CrispyPin#1149: i am lazy ok
Vynix#3003: ok
Vynix#3003: ...
CrispyPin#1149: i do
Vynix#3003: You said you hated PopOS
CrispyPin#1149: yes
